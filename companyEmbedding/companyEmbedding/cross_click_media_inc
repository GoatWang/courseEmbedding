Cross Click Media Inc. (PN) Description



CrossClick Media, Inc. is a publicly traded, innovative marketing and media services company that merges best practices of traditional marketing and sales methods and standards with the power of innovative technologies, the depth and breadth of new media channels and ease of advanced systems. We can expand your business or product brands, create relevant marketing campaigns inclusive of social and new media content, and invigorate your sales efforts that build revenues and provide market reach and depth through our Affiliate and Email Programs. Our call center operations and multi-level distribution channels are available to fulfill or expand your branding, marketing and sales goals. CrossClick Media, Inc. through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Co-Signer.com, Inc., provides commercial guarantee services for residential leases, creating a new U.S. industry that addresses the need for rent assurance in an increasingly restrictive approval environment, facilitating housing for tenants and enhancing occupancy rates and cash flow for landlords. The service replaces the discomfort and administrative headache of personal guarantees from friends or relatives with a reliable, professionally administered, commercial assurance. Widely used overseas, residential rent assurance has been available in the U.S. on a limited basis for the past 6 years. Co-Signer has perfected this service, is the leading provider markets it services along with tenant screening and residential placement services through Co-Signer.com and through direct contact with landlords and property managers. Co-Signer uses a proprietary approval algorithm and advanced information services to achieve low default ratios that maximize profitability. Fees are borne by the tenant and are less than the additional rent and security deposits required for tenants with low credit scores. The company's business strategy is to make the use of commercial guarantees for residential leases standard industry practice by focusing resources on landlord and property manager awareness in order to educate the market on the simplicity and value of the service.

The service replaces the discomfort and administrative headache of personal guarantees from friends or relatives with a reliable, professionally administered, commercial assurance. Co-Signer.com, Inc. provides its fee based tenant service to those who may have marginal or no credit due to a short sale, a bankruptcy, inconsistent employment, a long-term health issue or other circumstances. Typically these tenants are able to afford the rental payment for the new residence they seek. However, superficially their credit scores and financial profile do not readily qualify them with the prospective landlord. Cosigning services are available whether the tenant seeks a single family home, condominium, townhouse, or apartment anywhere in the United States. Used overseas, residential rent assurance has been available in the U.S. on a limited basis for the past 6 years. Co-Signer has perfected this service, is the leading provider markets its services along with tenant screening and residential placement services through www.Co-Signer.com and through direct contact with landlords and property managers. Co-Signer uses a proprietary underwriting process with an approval algorithm with state of the art information services to achieve low default ratios that maximize company profitability. Co-Signer.com offers rental guarantees on behalf of tenant clients to landlords, property managers, leasing agents and others that may be responsible for residential leasing. Fees are borne by the tenant and are less than the additional rent and security deposits required for tenants with low credit scores. The Company's business strategy is to make the use of commercial residential rent assurance otherwise known as a rent guarantee for residential lease standard industry practice by focusing resources on landlord and property manager awareness in order to educate the market on the simplicity and value of the service. With almost 39,000,000 rental units in the United States and 1 out of every 4 adults having poor or bad credit, the demand for commercialized cosigning services provides a real growth opportunity.

	Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	Certain statements, other than purely historical
	information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plan, objectives, and expected operating results,
	and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking
	statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
	“ estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,”
	“would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions.
	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which
	may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
	effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations
	and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory
	changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties
	should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.


	 



	Company Overview




	 



	CrossClick Media, Inc. (“CrossClick”
	or the

	“Company”)

	was incorporated in Nevada on February 23, 2010 as Southern
	Products, Inc. and


	was doing business as SIGMAC USA. On August 12, 2013, the Company
	acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock


	of Co-Signer.com,


	Inc.,


	a


	private


	Nevada


	corporation



	(“Co-Signer.com”).



	As


	a


	result


	of


	the


	acquisition,



	we



	divested


	our


	former


	consumer electronics


	business


	and


	began


	to


	focus


	on


	the


	business


	of


	Co-Signer.com,


	Inc.


	as


	our


	primary


	line


	of


	business.


	 


	On


	August


	12,


	2013,


	the


	Company


	completed


	its


	merger


	with


	Co-Signer.com


	and


	its


	wholly-owned


	subsidiary,


	Co-Signer


	Acquisition


	Corp. Under


	the


	Merger


	Agreement


	the


	Company


	merged


	with


	and


	into


	Co-Signer


	Acquisition


	Corp.


	In


	connection


	with


	the


	closing


	of


	this transaction,


	Co-Signer,


	Inc.


	acquired


	all


	of the


	issued


	and


	outstanding shares


	of the


	Company,


	which resulted


	in the


	Company becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Co-Signer, Inc. In exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of
	the Company’s stock, the shareholders received a total of 1,173,041 shares of the newly-designated Series A Convertible Preferred
	Stock, $51,440 in newly-issued 8% Secured Notes, warrants to purchase a total of 51,440 shares of common stock an exercise price
	of $0.25 per share, and 23,000,000 newly-issued shares of common stock.


	 


	The


	closing


	of


	the


	transaction


	has


	been


	characterized


	as


	a


	reverse


	capitalization;


	therefore,


	the


	historical


	financial


	statements


	are


	the


	financial statements


	of


	Co-Signer.com,


	Inc.


	which


	have


	been


	presented


	to


	retroactively


	reflect


	the


	historic


	capitalization


	of


	the


	accounting


	acquiree.


	 


	On June 18, 2014, the Company
	changed its name to CrossClick Media, Inc. from Co-Signer, Inc. with the full consent of the Board


	of Directors


	and filed such


	with


	the


	Nevada


	Secretary


	of


	State’s


	office.


	Subsequently


	FINRA


	approved the


	name


	and


	stock


	symbol


	change


	with


	an effective date of July 14. The Company transitioned from a real estate financial services holding company to a marketing
	and new


	media company featuring an affiliate network, call center, and an enterprise
	solutions division that can provide design, web development,


	ecommerce, data


	management


	and


	more


	through


	an


	integrated


	platform.


	 


	We are based in the Greater Las Vegas
	area in


	Nevada and sublease office space in Orange County in California.

	CrossClick Media, Inc. has developed
	a multi-channel marketing program known as the Ad Wheel. Businesses can readily target their selected audience using socio and
	economic demographics to deliver their marketing or branding message, “call to action” campaign or deliver an “act
	now” coupon or opportunity supported by our call center and online development departments to present a cohesive presentation
	and deliver results. This concept began to be developed in support the Company’s subsidiary, Co-Signer.com.


	 


	Co-Signer.com provided credit-challenged
	tenants with a cosigner while providing residential landlords a contracted rent


	payment
	guarantee


	for


	a


	specified


	number


	of


	months


	within


	the


	12


	month


	lease


	period


	for


	their


	specified


	properties,


	one


	lease


	at


	a


	time.


	This lease payment assurance program was flexible with defaulted rent paid
	for either a 3-month or 6-month period of time within


	the 12-month


	contract


	period,


	depending


	upon


	the


	requirement


	or


	election


	of


	the


	landlord. At this time, Co-Signer.com, is busy restructuring its business
	model, streamlining its processes and practices, having learned many lessons over 65 surety contracts and processing to deliver
	a more vibrant menu of online based services. We look forward to launching our revitalized web portal in the first quarter of 2015


	 


	Co-Signer.com was established as a result
	of the 2008 financial and housing crises. Since the

	summer

	of 2007 to today, a large


	number of


	Americans


	have


	lost


	their


	jobs,


	their


	homes


	and/or


	their


	businesses


	resulting


	in


	having


	their


	personal


	wealth


	and


	credit


	scores severely reduced and damaging their credit history. Over this
	same time period, circumstances and events have occurred leaving


	more and


	more


	people


	unable


	to


	qualify


	for


	a


	residential


	lease.


	A


	survey


	by


	the


	Associated


	Press


	(July


	2013)


	states


	that


	80%


	of


	all


	adult Americans


	will


	experience


	near


	poverty


	or


	unemployment


	in


	their


	lifetime


	while


	a


	recent


	report


	by


	Experian


	stated


	that


	America


	is becoming more of
	a renter nation out of choice, and as such, the need for residential cosigning of leases will only grow. As a result


	of these circumstances, the need to have someone cosign for a residential lease has increased. In the case of many tenants,
	the family


	and friends



	who

	would have


	cosigned for


	them a


	few years


	ago are


	now unable


	to do so.


	 


	Co-Signer.com


	seeks


	to


	meet


	the


	increased


	need


	for


	lease


	cosigners


	with


	the


	concept


	of


	commercializing


	residential


	rent


	guarantees (cosigning)


	as


	a


	professional


	financial


	service


	on


	a


	tenant-fee


	paid


	basis.


	Our


	service


	replaces


	the


	traditional


	need


	to


	rely


	on


	family


	and friends to cosign on a lease with an affordable and professional
	service that benefits both tenant and landlord; similar to the very


	same type of service
	that has been a mainstay in Australia’s residential leasing industry for over the past twenty years. This surety service
	product directly benefits the landlord and those responsible for the collection of residential rents while being paid for by an
	independent second party, the tenant. Instead of looking for an individual to be their guarantor or co-signer, or having to pay
	a significantly larger security deposit or prepaid rent, a renter may qualify to purchase a lease guarantee from Co-Signer.com
	to satisfy the landlord's financial and credit requirements. Additional benefits are available to the paying tenant, including
	a credit reporting option on the tenant’s rent payments during the contract period.


	 


	Over the past forty-three (43) months,
	Co-Signer.com has continued to develop, refine and field-test its business model and rent guarantee


	programs in


	targeted


	markets


	across


	the


	United


	States.


	Co-Signer.com’s


	management


	believes


	that


	the


	Company


	has


	a


	unique


	service


	ready


	to


	be distributed


	in


	the


	top


	twenty-five


	U.S.


	rental


	markets.


	In


	June


	2014


	the


	Company


	launched


	its


	test


	of


	an


	infield


	sales


	force


	in


	the


	Southern Michigan


	area.


	The


	test


	results


	did


	not


	meet



	management’s



	expectations


	and


	the


	Company


	is


	evaluating strategic


	opportunities


	for


	its


	future including sale of the asset to qualified third-party investors.


	 


	Co-Signer.com’s


	growth


	strategy


	is


	based


	on


	the


	expansion


	of


	its


	residential


	lease


	payment


	program


	and


	on bundling


	this


	program


	with


	tenant


	screening


	and


	residential


	placement


	services


	online.


	The



	Company’s



	goal


	is


	to


	make


	the


	use


	of commercial


	rent


	assurance


	the


	U.S.


	industry


	standard


	and


	to


	focus


	its


	resources


	and


	market


	awareness


	efforts


	on landlords


	and property
	managers,


	educating them on the


	simplicity
	and


	value


	of the



	Company’s

	service that facilitates housing for tenants and maximizes
	occupancy rates and cash flow for landlords. With almost 39,000,000 rental units in the United States and 1 out of every 4 adults
	having poor, bad, or no


	credit, the demand


	for
	commercialized


	cosigning services provides a real growth opportunity.

	Item 2. Properties




	 



	Our corporate headquarters is located in Las
	Vegas, Nevada. We also rented approximately 4,100 square feet of office space, used as our local call center, on a monthly basis.
	This location’s rent escalated quarterly and culminated in a monthly rate of $2,500, which ceased April 15, 2015. We currently
	sublease part of an office approximately 2,800 square feet in Orange County, CA as acall center.




	 






	Item 3. Legal Proceedings



	 


	We are a party to two pending legal proceedings.
	We are not aware of any other pending legal proceeding to which any of our officers, directors, or any beneficial holders of 5%
	or more of our voting securities are adverse to us or have a material interest adverse to us.


	 


	On April 10, 2015, IRTH Communications, LLC,

	Our common stock is quoted under the

	and the OTC-Pink tier of the market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.  Few market makers continue to participate in
	the OTCBB system because of high fees charged by FINRA. Consequently, market makers that once quoted our shares on the
	OTCBB system may no longer be posting a quotation for our shares. As of the date of this report, however, our shares are
	quoted by several market makers on the OTC-Pink market tier.

	Dividend Policy



	 


	We have never paid any cash dividends and intend,
	for the foreseeable future, to retain any future earnings for the development of our business. Our Board of Directors will determine
	our future dividend policy on the basis of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements
	and investment opportunities.


	 



	Penny Stock Considerations



	The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer
	practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of
	less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided
	that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system.
	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure
	document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in
	both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and
	of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities
	laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and
	the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
	actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains
	such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.


	 


	The broker-dealer also must provide, prior
	to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation
	of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or
	other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement
	showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.


	 


	In addition, the penny stock rules require
	that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written
	determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment
	of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and
	dated copy of a written suitability statement.


	 


	These disclosure requirements may have the
	effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.

	Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	Certain statements, other than purely historical
	information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results,
	and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking
	statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,”
	“estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,”
	“would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions.
	Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which
	may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual
	effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse affect on our operations
	and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory
	changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties
	should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.


	 



	Results of Operation for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared
	to the year ended December 31, 2013




	 




	Revenue

	  


	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized
	$326,009 of revenue as compared to $62,991 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $263,018 or 418%. The increase
	is primarily due to revenue received from our new business model of providing market and investor awareness programs, affiliate
	and digital marketing and call center services as well as website and marketing support.


	 


	Of the revenue recognized in 2014, $190,863
	was from Avalanche International Corp and its subsidiary Smith and Ramsay Brands, LLC. This accounts for approximately 58.6% of
	total revenue. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is the controlling shareholder of Cross Click Media, Inc. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is also the majority
	member of Philou Ventures, LLC, which is the controlling







	11

	 









	 






	shareholder of Avalanche International Corp.
	The Company also recognized revenue of $73,706 from Foundation for a Greater America, Inc. (“FFAGA”). The Chairman
	of the Board for FFAGA is married to the managing member of MCKEA Holdings, LLC and two directors of FFAGA are both members of
	MCKEA Holdings, LLC, the controlling shareholder of CrossClick Media, Inc.


	 



	Cost of revenue and gross margin



	For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost
	of revenue was $52,745 compared to $0 in the prior year. The increase in cost of sales is in conjunction with the increase in revenue.
	Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $273,264 compared to $62,991.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	Professional fees for the year ended December
	31, 2014 were $119,028, as compared to $191,738 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $72,710 or 38%.  Professional
	fees mainly consist of legal, auditor and other fees associated with the Company’s quarterly filings and year-end audit.
	Professional fees were higher in prior year due to the additional fees incurred for the merger.


	 


	Salaries and wage expense for the year ended
	December 31, 2014 were $336,729, as compared to $128,568 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $208,161 or 162%. The
	increase in the current period is attributed to changes within management personnel.


	 


	Advertising and promotion expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2014 was $109,624, as compared to $149,647 for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $40,023 or 26.7%.
	The decrease is primarily due to the change in business direction and use of funds.


	 


	Consulting expense went from $0 for the year
	ended December 31, 2013 to $158,056 in the current year. In June 2014, the Company entered a consulting agreement for $60,000 with
	a business-restructuring consultant in support of its change in business model and to assist with the future of Co-Signer.com,
	Inc. The services contract was for six months, ending prior to December 31, 2014. A majority of the rest of the consulting expense
	is for investor relations services.


	 


	Stock-based compensation expense for the year
	ended December 31, 2014 was $1,081,991, as compared to $421,149 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $660,842 or
	157%. Stock compensation expense is a combination of stock, stock options and warrants issued to officers and other third party
	services providers.


	 


	General and administrative expense for the
	year ended December 31, 2014 was $710,610, as compared to $213,733 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $496,877
	or 232%. Part of the increase in G&A expense is due to $277,600 in loan fees, $50,000 in penalty expense as well as increased
	travel.


	 



	Other income and expense



	During the year ended December 31, 2014 we
	incurred $1,255,620 of expense for amortization of debt discount, $401,664 of derivative expense, had a loss on the change in fair
	value of our derivative liability of $4,680, a loss on extinguishment of debt of $141,070 and interest expense of $188,414. Over
	all other expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $1,412,762 to $2,007,177 from $594,415 in the prior year.


	 



	Net Loss



	Overall we recorded a net loss of $4,249,951
	for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to a net loss of $1,636,259 for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase
	of $2,613,692. As discussed above the increase in net loss can in part attributed to stock issued for services, an increase in
	general and administrative expense and an increase in the amortization of debt discount, interest expense and the loss on extinguishment
	of debt.


	 


	As we continue to develop out business we expect
	that both our operating expenses and our gross revenues will continue to increase.


	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated
	deficit of $6,608,621 and a working capital deficit of $3,624,971. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in operating
	activities was $719,364 and we netted $719,533 from financing activities. We also used $1,961 for investing activities.


	 


	On June 29, 2012, we issued a $488,489 Convertible
	Promissory Note and Security Interest in favor of a trade creditor representing the past due invoices of the creditor for professional
	fees. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the creditor advanced a total of $8,006 for payment of our operating expenses whereby
	increasing the principal balance of the note to







	12

	 









	 






	$491,465. The note is collateralized through
	the granting of a Security Interest in all the current and future assets of the Company until such time the note is fully satisfied.
	The Security Interest was subsequently perfected by the holder through filing. As amended, the Convertible Promissory Note is now
	due in full on or before May 31, 2014. The conversion price of the Note, amended, is $0.075 per share. Additionally, certain accounts
	payable and accrued expenses of $278,962 due to the creditor for services provided subsequent to the issuance of the original obligation
	were added to the Note. On October 14, 2014, the Company executed the Third Amendment to the Convertible Promissory Note. In this
	amendment the due date was changed to December 31, 2014 and the conversion price to either 1) $0.005 per share, or 2) 80% of the
	average of the three lowest trading days in the twenty days prior to the conversion date. As of December 31, 2014 this note is
	past due and there is principal and interest due of $812,249 and $112,661 on the new note, respectively.


	 


	On August 12, 2013, in connection with the
	merger, the Company issued $51,440 of new notes. The notes are secured, bear interest at 8% and mature in five years. As of December
	31, 2014 there is $5,706 of accrued interest on these notes.


	 


	On September 23, 2013, we entered into a $400,000
	Promissory Note (the “Note”) with JMJ Financial (“JMJ”). The face amount of the Note includes an original
	issue discount of $40,000. Funds are loaned to the Company under a series of advances made under the Note. Loans made under the
	Note mature in one year from the date of the advance and, if repaid within ninety (90) days from the date of issue, the loans will
	not bear interest. Upon ninety days after the date of issue, a onetime interest charge of twelve percent (12%) of the principal
	amount will be applied. JMJ may convert all or part of the balance under the Note, at its discretion, into shares of our common
	stock. The conversion price is sixty percent (60%) of the lowest trading price for our common stock in the twenty-five trading
	days immediately preceding the conversion date.

	On November 4, 2013, we obtained short term
	financing from a Lender under a 9% Convertible Note in the amount of $70,000 (the “Short-Term Note”). The Short-Term
	Note features an original issue discount of $6,700. The $63,300 in funding received from the Lender was used to pay off and retire
	a prior Convertible Promissory Note issued to Asher Enterprises, Inc., dated April 9, 2013. The Short-Term Note accrues interest
	at a rate of nine percent (9%) per year, with all principal and interest due in full within thirty days from the date of issue.

	As of December 31, 2014, there were no off
	balance sheet arrangements.




	 





	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
	about Market Risk



	 


	We have not utilized
	any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts or interest
	rate swaps and futures. We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities. We do not have any borrowings
	and, consequently, we are not affected by changes in market interest rates. While we do have significant sales outside the United
	States, all of our sales are settled with US currency, and we do not currently own assets and operate facilities in countries outside
	the United States and, consequently, we are not affected by foreign currency fluctuations or exchange rate changes.  Overall,
	we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial
	condition or results of operations.


	We have not entered into
	any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.



	Critical Accounting
	Policies



	In December 2001, the SEC requested that all
	registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated
	that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial
	condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the
	need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At this time, management does not believe that
	any of our accounting policies fit this definition.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The Company has reviewed issued accounting
	pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements
	to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.

	To the Board of Directors


	Cross Click Media, Inc.


	Las Vegas, Nevada


	 


	We have audited the accompanying
	consolidated balance sheet of Cross Click Media, Inc. as of December 31, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of
	operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements
	are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
	audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company has
	determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
	that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated
	financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cross Click Media,
	Inc. as of December 31, 2013, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that Cross Click Media, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 12
	to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations, has negative working capital, and
	is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable. These factors raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regard to these matters
	are described in Note 12. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
	from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	CROSSCLICK MEDIA, INC.






	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	December


	31, 2014



	 



	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES



	 




	Nature of Business




	CrossClick Media, Inc. (“CrossClick”
	or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on February 23, 2010 as Southern Products, Inc. and was doing business
	as SIGMAC USA. On August 12, 2013, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Co-Signer.com, Inc.,
	a private Nevada corporation (“Co-Signer.com”). As a result of the acquisition, we divested our former consumer electronics
	business and began to focus on the business of Co-Signer.com, Inc. as our primary line of business.


	 


	On August 12, 2013, the Company completed its
	merger with Co-Signer.com and its wholly owned subsidiary, Co-Signer Acquisition Corp. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company
	merged with and into Co-Signer Acquisition Corp. In connection with the closing of this transaction, Co-Signer, Inc. acquired all
	of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, which resulted in the Company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Co-Signer,
	Inc. In exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s stock, the shareholders received a total of
	1,173,041 shares of the newly-designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $51,440 in newly-issued 8% Secured Notes, warrants
	to purchase a total of 51,440 shares of common stock an exercise price of $0.25 per share, and 23,000,000 newly-issued shares of
	common stock.


	 


	The closing of the transaction has been characterized
	as a reverse capitalization; therefore, the historical financial statements are the financial statements of Co-Signer.com, Inc.,
	which have been presented to retroactively reflect the historic capitalization of the accounting acquiree.


	 


	On June 18, 2014, the Company changed its name
	to CrossClick Media, Inc. from Co-Signer, Inc. with the full consent of the Board of Directors and filed such with the Nevada Secretary
	of State’s office. Subsequently FINRA approved the name and stock symbol change with an effective date of July 14. The Company
	transitioned from a real estate financial services holding company to a digital marketing and new media company featuring an affiliate
	network, call center, and an enterprise solutions division that can provide design, web development, ecommerce, data management
	and more through an integrated platform.


	 




	Basis of Presentation




	The Company’s consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
	GAAP”).The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company has adopted a December
	31 year-end.


	 


	Management further acknowledges that it is
	solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control
	and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items,
	that 1) recorded transactions are valid; 2) valid transactions are recorded; and 3) transactions are recorded in the proper period
	in a timely manner to produce financial  statements  which  present  fairly  the  financial  condition,
	 results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the Company for the respective periods
	being presented.


	 




	Reclassification




	Certain reclassifications have been made to
	conform the prior year information to the 2014 classifications for comparative purposes.


	 




	Principles of consolidation




	The consolidated financial statements include
	the accounts of Cross Click Media, Inc. and Co-Signer.com, Inc.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions
	have been eliminated. Cross Click Media, Inc. and Co-Signer.com, Inc., will be collectively referred herein to as the “Company”.


	 




	Concentrations of Credit Risk




	The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit
	accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company continually monitors its banking relationships
	and consequently has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
	risk on cash and cash equivalents.


	 






	F-

	7

	 









	 








	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.



	 





	Accounts Receivable




	Revenues that have been recognized but not
	yet received are recorded as accounts receivable. Losses on receivables will be recognized when it is more likely than not that
	a receivable will not be collected. An allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts will be recognized to reduce the amount of
	receivables to its net realizable value. The allowance for uncollectible amounts is evaluated quarterly.


	 


	The Company performs sales, marketing,
	and investor relation services for other related party companies. As of December 31, 2014, we have accounts receivable
	totaling $97,760 due from Avalanche International, Corp and its subsidiary Smith and Ramsay Brands, LLC. This accounts for
	approximately 63.8% of total accounts receivable. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is the controlling shareholder of Cross Click Media,
	Inc. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is also the majority member of Philou Ventures, LLC, which is the controlling shareholder of
	Avalanche International, Corp. All of the outstanding balance due was subsequently collected. Also, as of December 31, 2014,
	we have accounts receivable of $47,896 or 31.2% of total accounts receivable due from Foundation for a Greater America, Inc.
	(“FFAGA”). Subsequent to December 31, 2014, $31,650 has been collected on this account. The remaining balance of
	$16,246 has been credited to an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Chairman of the Board for FFAGA and two directors of
	FFAGA are both members of MCKEA Holdings, LLC, the controlling shareholder of CrossClick Media, Inc.


	 




	Property and Equipment




	Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation
	and amortization are provided utilizing the straight-line method over the related asset’s estimated useful life of three
	years.


	 


	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
	as incurred; renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized.  Upon retirement or
	disposal, the asset cost and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts
	and a resulting gain or loss, if any, is included in the results of operations.


	 




	Intangible Assets




	The Company classifies intangible assets into
	three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives
	not subject to amortization and (3) goodwill. The Company determines the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets after considering
	the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors the Company considers when determining useful lives
	include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset, the Company’s
	strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic
	factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized,
	on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives of three years.


	 




	Fair value of financial instruments




	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial
	instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase consistency
	and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy
	that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value
	hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the
	lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described
	below:


	 


	Level 1: Quoted market prices available in
	active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.


	 


	Level 2: Pricing
	inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of
	the reporting date.


	 


	Level 3: Unobservable
	inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations
	derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.


	 


	The carrying amount of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the
	short maturity of those instruments.  The Company’s notes payable approximate






	F-

	the fair value of such instruments based upon
	management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at
	December 31, 2014.


	 


	The following table presents assets and liabilities

	Net income (loss) per common share




	Net income (loss) per common share is computed
	pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed
	by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted
	net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
	stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period.  The weighted average number of common shares
	outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period
	presented. Any potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the computation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 as they would have
	been anti-dilutive.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition, which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue
	is recognized: 1) existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
	3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and 4) collection is reasonably assured. Our revenue recognition
	policies are consistent with these criteria. For Tenant Application fees revenue is recognized at the time each application is
	submitted. Upon the signing of a Co-Signer.com Tenant Agreement and the corresponding Co-Signer.com, Inc. Landlord Agreement supplemented
	by the executed Tenant Client’s lease, the Company recognizes the revenue for each Surety Fee as indicated in the Tenant
	Agreement, usually on a monthly basis.


	 


	For media and marketing fees, revenue is recognized
	upon completion of the task. Each client signs a Statement of Work order which is signed off by the client upon completion or per
	the terms outlined in the Statement of Work and invoiced accordingly.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the
	Company recognized total revenue of $190,863 from Avalanche International, Corp and its subsidiary Smith and Ramsay Brands, LLC.
	This accounts for approximately 58.6% of total revenue. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is the controlling shareholder of Cross Click Media,
	Inc. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is also the majority member of Philou Ventures, LLC, which is the controlling shareholder of Avalanche
	International, Corp. The Company also recognized revenue of $73,706 from Foundation for a Greater America, Inc. (“FFAGA”).
	The Chairman of the Board for FFAGA is married to the managing member of MCKEA Holdings, LLC and two directors of FFAGA are members
	of MCKEA Holdings, LLC, the controlling shareholder of CrossClick Media, Inc.


	 




	Default Rent Reserve Policy




	The Company reviews each calendar quarter whether
	a default rent reserve should be established and funded. As of December 31, 2014 the Company has not considered it necessary to
	fund such a reserve. The Company’s pricing model provides cash flows to offset default risk when losses are below 100% of
	the lowest default rate per Experian Rent Bureau’s analysis of default rates of tenants that are “Unscoreable”.
	That number for 2013 and 2014 was 9.00%. If the Company is to experience losses above 9%, it will then fund a reserve account based
	upon trend.


	 




	Stock-Based Compensation




	We account for equity instruments issued in
	exchange for the receipt of goods or services from non-employees. Costs are measured at the fair market value of the consideration
	received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments
	issued for consideration other than employee services is






	F-

	9

	 









	 






	determined on the earlier of the date on which
	there first exists a firm commitment for performance by the provider of goods or services or on the date performance is complete.
	The Company recognizes the fair value of the equity instruments issued that result in an asset or expense being recorded by the
	company, in the same period(s) and in the same manner, as if the Company has paid cash for the goods or services.


	 


	The Company accounts for employee stock-based
	compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,

	Compensation - Stock Compensation

	which requires all
	share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based
	on their fair values.  The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited
	to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.


	 


	The Company follows ASC Topic 505-50, formerly
	EITF 96-18, “

	Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction
	with Selling Goods and Services

	,” for stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non-employees.  In
	accordance with ASC Topic 505-50, these stock options and warrants issued as compensation for services provided to the Company
	are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant,
	whichever can be more clearly determined.


	 




	Advertising and Marketing costs




	The Company expenses all costs of advertising
	as incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there was $109,624 of and $149,647, respectively, in advertising
	and marketing costs.


	 




	Income Taxes




	The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
	tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
	assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
	enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced
	by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which
	those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
	in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the
	FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”) with regards to uncertainty income taxes.  Section
	740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded
	in the financial statements.  Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
	only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
	technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be
	measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
	Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting
	in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized
	income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25.


	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	The Company has implemented all new accounting
	pronouncements that are in effect.  These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless
	otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued,
	that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES



	 


	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability
	method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry
	forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	The provision for Federal income tax consists
	of the following for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:

	At December 31, 2014, the Company had net operating
	loss carry forwards of approximately $5,600,000 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2014 to 2033. No
	tax benefit has been reported in the December 31, 2014 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation
	allowance of the same amount.


	 


	Due to the change in ownership provisions of
	the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations.
	Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.



	 




	NOTE 12 - GOING CONCERN




	 



	As of December 31, 2014, the Company has a
	working capital deficit of $3,624,971, an accumulated deficit of $6,608,621. The financial statements are prepared using the generally
	accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities
	in the normal course of business. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as
	a going concern. The Company’s management plans on raising cash from public or private debt or equity financing, on an as
	needed basis and in the longer term, upon achieving profitable operations through its business activities.

	ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
	Accounting and Financial Disclosure



	There are not and have not been any disagreements
	between us and our accountants on any matter of accounting principles, practices or financial statement disclosure.



	 





	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures



	 


	As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
	end of the period covered by this annual report, being December 31, 2014. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
	and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.


	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
	and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
	and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to
	ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
	is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Based upon that evaluation, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as
	of the end of the period covered by this annual report.


	 



	Management’s Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014
	based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over
	financial reporting were not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over
	financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
	risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the
	requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.


	 


	We plan to take steps to enhance and improve
	the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have
	not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following
	changes during our fiscal year ending December 31, 2015: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation
	of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial
	reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover
	the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely
	affected in a material manner.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation
	report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
	was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set
	forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting




	 



	There were no changes in the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2014 that have
	materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

	Director









	Set forth below is a brief description of the
	background and business experience of each of our current executive officers and Directors.


	 


	Kurtis A. Kramarenko - appointed as the new
	CEO effective December 16, 2013. Mr. Kramarenko, is an accomplished businessman whose career has spanned several business sectors,
	primarily the financial and pharmaceutical industries. Mr. Kramarenko’s broad career experience has produced a comprehensive
	set of attributes and is noted for a unique blend of executive acumen and team building skills. These attributes are combined with
	a history of strategic solution development that include the realignment of product and company margins, which result in a strong
	improvement of operations and return on investment (ROI). During his tenure at the international pharmaceutical company, Tap Pharmaceuticals
	Inc., Mr. Kramarenko repeatedly led the company in sales nationwide eclipsing all previous sales goals. Mr. Kramarenko has the
	unique experience of successfully launching and bringing several new drugs to market and helping to grow market share. As Chief
	Investment Officer at Mutual Savings Bank, a regional institution with total assets of over $1.2 B, he managed their $750 MM portfolio.

	Basement Systems since November of 2011. In addition, he has been a member of the Board of Directors of Conceivex, Inc. since 2008.

	finance, marketing and interpersonal communications. He has also preformed postgraduate studies in business at both Central Michigan
	and Princeton University.

	was Secretary and a Director of LetUsCoSign, Inc. from June of 2011 through November of 2011. Mr. Gottlieb worked with CoreStream
	Energy, Inc. from June of 2010 through May of 2011. He was the Chief Financial Officer of Zealous, Inc. from December of 2008 through
	June of 2010. In the past, Mr. Gottlieb has worked with various private firms specializing in the nutraceuticals, IT Consulting,
	media, and marketing industries. Mr. Gottlieb has a BS in Business Administration from California State University in Northridge
	with an emphasis in Accounting and Management.


	 


	Darren M. Magot – appointed as Director
	of Co-Signer Inc. effective December 9, 2013. He was President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer
	of the Company. Mr. Magot has nearly 20 years of selling experience to lead teams in the accounting, utilities, and market research
	spaces. He is currently an AVP with Instantly, where he has been for four years. Before Instantly, Mr. Magot worked with Research
	Panel Asia for a year and Global Market Insight for five years ramping up their sales divisions. Mr. Magot has long been active
	with emerging companies, and has owned a number of business leveraging his sales and finance experience. Mr. Magot has a Finance
	degree from California State University, Chico and is active in many organizations in Southern California.


	 



	Term of Office



	 


	Our Directors are appointed initially for a
	two year term to hold office and then annually until resignation or removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers
	are appointed by our Board of Directors and hold office until resignation or are removed by the Board.



	 




	Family Relationships



	 


	There are no family relationships between or
	among the Directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to become Directors or executive officers.

	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings



	 


	To the best of our knowledge, during the past
	ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former Director, executive officer, or employee: (1) any
	bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at
	the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject
	to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment
	or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining,
	barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and
	(4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
	to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.


	 



	Committees of the Board



	 


	We do not currently have a compensation committee, executive committee,
	or stock plan committee.


	 



	Audit Committee



	 


	We do not have a separately designated standing
	audit committee. The entire Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit committee, but no written charter governs the
	actions of the Board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed by an audit committee. The Board approves
	the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent accountants to discuss issues related
	to financial reporting. In addition, the Board reviews the scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews
	with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal accounting
	procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the performance
	of the independent auditor. Our Board of Directors, which performs the functions of an audit committee, does not have a member
	who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” within the definition of Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation
	S-K. We believe that, at our current size and stage of development, the addition of a special audit committee financial expert
	to the Board is not necessary.


	 



	Code of Ethics



	 


	As of December 31, 2014, we had not adopted
	a Code of Ethics for Financial Executives, which would include our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
	accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions.




	 






	Item 11. Executive Compensation



	 



	Compensation Discussion and Analysis



	 


	Our President and CEO, Kurtis A. Kramarenko,
	has been paid a salary of $72,000 per year. During the reporting period, and effective February 13, 2014, we entered into an Executive
	Employment Agreement with Mr. Kramarenko (the “Agreement”). The Agreement provides him with a base salary of $72,000
	per year, together with a signing bonus of 1 MM shares of the Company’s common stock fully vested immediately, and annual
	bonuses in the discretion of the Board. The initial term of the Agreement is for one year, subject to annual renewal by the Board.
	The Agreement contains various other terms and conditions and be reviewed in its entirety for more information. The goals of the
	Agreement are to continue to retain Mr. Kramarenko with a cash salary commensurate with his experience and responsibilities, while
	also providing him an incentive to maximize shareholder value by vesting him with significant stock ownership.

	Disclosure of Commission Position of Indemnification
	for Securities Act Liabilities








	21

	 









	 






	 


	In accordance with the provisions in our articles
	of incorporation, we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
	arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons
	pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
	for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
	or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
	or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter
	has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.



	 





	Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
	Transactions, and Director Independence




	 



	Except as set forth below, none of our directors
	or executive officers, nor any proposed nominee for election as a director, nor any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,
	shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to all of our outstanding shares, nor any members of the immediate family
	(including spouse, parents, children, siblings, and in-laws) of any of the foregoing persons has any material interest, direct
	or indirect, in any transaction since our incorporation or in any presently proposed transaction which, in either case, has or
	will materially affect us:


	 


	1. Mr. Gottlieb, our Secretary and a Director,
	was formerly the Secretary, Director and Co-Founder of LetUsCoSign, Inc. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Co-Signer.com, Inc. acquired
	the assets of LetUsCoSign, Inc. on January 1, 2012. Subsequently, on August 13, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding
	stock of Co-Signer.com, Inc.


	 


	2. Mr. Arguelles, a former Director, is the
	Executive Vice President of Imagine Media Group, Inc. Imagine Media Group has contracted to develop and maintain our online presence.
	Its responsibilities include database development, application processing and evaluation, and developing and maintaining an integrated
	tenant screening, sales and marketing program. Our relationship with Imagine Media Group is governed by Client Service Contract
	dated July 1, 2013, a copy of which was filed with our Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 15, 2013.


	 


	3. Darren Magot, our former CEO and a Director,
	has entered into an employment agreement with us under which he was granted 250,000 shares of common stock as a signing bonus and
	options to purchase 1,000,000 share of common stock at a price of $0.08 per share, vested at a rate of 250,000 per quarter.


	 


	4. We entered short term loan dated January
	3, 2014 with our director and former CEO, Darren Magot, for $15,000.00 at 10% simple interest per annum and a $750.00 loan fee
	per week until all principal and interest is paid in full. This note had an initial due date of January 14, 2013 and was extended
	until January 31, 2014. On January 27, 2014, we issued an 8% Convertible Promissory Note to Darren Magot for $37,500. This Note
	consolidates the short term bridge loan on January 3, 2014 along with two more installments received as of this date of $22,500.
	The Note is convertible into common shares of our common stock at $.04 per share. In addition, we issued Mr. Magot warrants to
	purchase 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at $.05 per share, exercisable for three years.


	 


	5. Effective February 13, 2014, we entered
	into an Executive Employment Agreement with Kurt Kramarenko, our President and CEO (the “Agreement”). The Agreement
	provides him with a base salary of $72,000 per year, together with a signing bonus of 1 million shares of the Company’s common
	stock fully vested immediately, and annual bonuses in the discretion of the Board. The initial term of the Agreement is for one
	year, subject to annual renewal by the Board. The Agreement contains various other terms and conditions and should be reviewed
	in its entirety for more information. The goals of the Agreement are to continue to retain Mr. Kramarenko with a cash salary commensurate
	with his experience and responsibilities, while also providing him an incentive to maximize shareholder value by vesting him with
	significant stock ownership. Mr. Kramarenko was also granted 1,000,000 shares of common stock as a bonus, together with warrants
	to purchase 4,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.05, to be vested quarterly over two (2) years.


	 


	6. We are party to a $65,000 note dated February
	1, 2013 with Finiks Capital, LLC. At the time the note was issued, Finiks was the owner of approximately 11.76% of our common stock.
	The note bears interest at a rate of five percent (5%) per year, and is due on or before February 1, 2015. All principal and interest
	is due at maturity and we may pre-pay the note without penalty upon 30 days written notice. The note is convertible to common stock
	at a price of $0.0065 per share at the option of the holder. Finiks has made additional advances under the note. On January 19,
	2014, Finiks Capital transferred its rights to the $65,000 promissory note and $3,879 of accrued interest to Strategic IR, Inc.


	 







	22

	 









	 






	7. On October 6, 2014, we executed with our
	controlling shareholder, MCKEA Holdings, LLC, a Convertible Promissory Note for $198,930 in exchange for the assignment and assumption
	of debt due from the Company and its subsidiary, Co-Signer.com, Inc. The debt includes a total of $110,803 due to third-party service
	suppliers and debt due to MCKEA for $88,127. The Note is secured by the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Class B stock
	that has a non-diluting feature, and convertible into the Company’s shares of common stock, as consideration. On the same
	day the full $198,930 was converted into the 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Class B stock.


	 


	8. During the year ended December 31, 2014,
	the Company recognized total revenue of $190,863 from Avalanche International, Corp and its subsidiary Smith and Ramsay Brands,
	LLC. This accounts for approximately 58.6% of total revenue. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is the controlling shareholder of Cross Click
	Media, Inc. MCKEA Holdings, LLC is also the majority member of Philou Ventures, LLC, which is the controlling shareholder of Avalanche
	International, Corp.


	 


	9. The Company also recognized revenue of $73,706
	from Foundation for a Greater America, Inc. (“FFAGA”). The Chairman of the Board for FFAGA is married to the managing
	member of MCKEA Holdings, LLC and two directors of FFAGA are members of MCKEA Holdings, LLC, the controlling shareholder of CrossClick
	Media, Inc.


	 


	10. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, the Company
	received a series of unsecured loans totaling $195,600 from Avalanche International, Corp. accruing interest at 12% for one year.


	 


	11.	On June 5, 2015, we executed a 10% Simple
	Interest Promissory Note in favor of Avalanche International Corp. in the amount of $12,500. The Note is due on or before December
	31, 2015 and it replaces the promissory note previously issued to Black Mountain Equities, LLC dated March 5, 2014, which was purchased
	by Avalanche International Corp.


	 


	12. On September 15, 2015, the Company executed
	a renewable Management Services Agreement with MCKEA Holdings, LLC for one year effective January 1, 2015 to coordinate financial
	and capital restructuring, business development and other consulting services. The minimum monthly services fee is $20,000 payable
	in cash or stock at the discretion of the Company.


	 




	Director Independence




	 


	We are not a “listed issuer” within
	the meaning of Item 407 of Regulation S-K and there are no applicable listing standards for determining the independence of our
	Directors. Applying the definition of independence set forth in Rule 4200(a)(15) of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc., we believe that
	no Director can be deemed an independent Director.


	 



	SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE



	 


	The Company's Executive Officers, Directors
	and 10% stockholders are required under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to file reports of ownership
	and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these reports must also be furnished to the Company.


	 


	To the best of our knowledge based solely on
	a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 (and any amendments thereof) received by us during or with respect to the year ended December 31,
	2014, no persons have failed to file on a timely basis as required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2014.

	Medium Term Promissory Note w/Specified
	Repayment Structure



	April 09, 2015




	 




	$50,000.00	




	 




	FOR VALUE RECEIVED,

	the undersigned, CrossClick Media, Inc. (XCLK) (Maker), promises to pay to the order of Charles J. Kalina (Holder), or the
	successors and assigns, the Principal Sum of Twenty-Five Thousand ($25,000) dollars, plus a Loan Fee of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)
	plus a Default Penalty of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000) dollars, for a total of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), subject to the terms
	and conditions set forth herein. The interest rate will be Ten (10%) Percent annually based solely on the outstanding principal,
	compounded monthly until maturity, which will be November 18, 2016 (Ten (10) days after the Federal Presidential Election on November
	8, 2016).


	 


	Principal and interest payment shall be made
	to:


	 


	Charles J. Kalina


	93 Grove Street


	Somerville, NJ 08876


	 


	Holder is providing this
	loan to Maker as a bridge loan to provide funding and liquidity while Maker is awaiting an announcement by Hillary R. Clinton of
	her candidacy for President of the United States of America. This note shall include a Warrant (see Addendum “A”, attached)
	which will expire on November 18, 2016 (ten (10) days after the Federal Presidential Election on November 8, 2016), that provides
	the Holder the right to purchase two (2%) percent of the outstanding Common Stock of CrossClick Media, Inc. (XCLK) for Ten Thousand
	($10,000) dollars at any time before the Warrant expires, which will be Ten (10) days after the National Presidential Election
	on November 8, 2016.


	 


	Each month, beginning
	on May 18, 2015, and on the 18

	th

	of each successive month (unless a weekend or holiday as stated in Addendum “B”,
	attached, for more on these dates), Maker will pay a sum of One Thousand ($1,000.00) dollars or Five (5%) percent of net revenues
	(to be more fully identified in Addendum “B”, attached) of Maker, whichever are higher. These monthly payments will
	retire the debt in the following order: Default Fee of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000) dollars first; then the Loan Fee of Ten Thousand
	($10,000) dollars; then the accrued unpaid interest (the amount of interest that has accrued until the time as the Default and
	Loan Fees are fully retired); and followed by payment of both Principal & Interest for the remainder of the term of the note.
	Any unpaid balance will be retired as a balloon payment on the date of maturity which is November 18, 2016. All payments shall
	be made in lawful money of the United States of America.


	 







	1

	 









	 






	The Warrant, which provides
	Holder an opportunity to purchase Two (2%) percent of the Common Stock of CrossClick Media, Inc. (XCLK), will have a cost of Ten
	Thousand ($10,000) dollars. If the Warrant is fully paid by the Holder, then there will be no change to the structure of this note.
	However, if the Holder exercises the option to purchase the Warrant on a “Cashless” basis, then the remaining outstanding
	balance shall be reduced by that same amount, Ten Thousand ($10,000) dollars.


	 


	Maker will reimburse legal
	expenses to Holder for any costs and expenses incurred in enforcing this Note to the extent allowable by applicable law. Those
	expenses include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees.



	 



	Maker and Holder waive
	the rights of Presentment and Notice of Dishonor. "Presentment" means the right to require the Holder to demand payment
	of amounts due. "Notice of Dishonor" means the right to require the Holder to give notice to other persons that amounts
	due have not been paid.


	 


	The Maker represents and warrants to Holder:


	 



	Organization and Qualification

	.
	The Maker, with full power and authority (corporate and other) to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to carry on its
	business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. The Maker is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to
	do business and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which its ownership or use of property or the nature of the business
	conducted by it makes such qualification necessary except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have
	a Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” means any material adverse effect on the business, operations,
	assets, financial condition or prospects of the Maker or its Subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole, or on the transactions contemplated
	hereby or by the agreements or instruments to be entered into in connection herewith.


	 



	Authorization; Enforcement

	.
	(i) The Maker has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform this Note and to consummate the transactions
	contemplated hereby and thereby and to agree to all fees charged, in accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) the execution and delivery
	of this Note by the Maker and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized
	by the Maker’s Board of Directors and no further consent or authorization of the Maker, its Board of Directors, or its shareholders
	is required, (iii) this Note has been duly executed and delivered by the Maker by its authorized representative, and such authorized
	representative is the true and official representative with authority to sign this Note and the other documents executed in connection
	herewith and bind the Maker accordingly, and (iv) this Note constitutes, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Maker enforceable
	against the Maker in accordance with its terms.


	 



	No Conflicts

	. The
	execution, delivery and performance the Note by the Maker and the consummation by the Maker of the transactions contemplated hereby
	will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Maker,
	or (ii) violate or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice
	or lapse of time or both could become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
	cancellation of, any agreement, indenture, patent, patent license or instrument to which the Maker or any of its Subsidiaries is
	a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state securities
	laws and regulations and regulations of any self-regulatory organizations to which the Maker or its securities are subject) applicable
	to the Maker or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Maker or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected
	(except for such conflicts, defaults, terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations as would not, individually
	or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect).







	2

	 









	 








	No
	Integrated Offering

	. Neither the Maker, nor any of its affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf, has directly
	or indirectly made any offers or sales in any security or solicited any offers to buy any security under circumstances that would
	require registration under the 1933 Act of the issuance of this note or the Conversion Stock to the Holder.



	 



	No Investment Company

	.
	The Company is not an “investment company” required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (an “Investment
	Company”). The Maker is not controlled by an Investment Company.


	 


	This Note is a uniform
	instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions.


	 



	Notices

	. Any notice
	herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served or delivered by courier or sent by United
	States mail and shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt if personally served (which shall include telephone line facsimile
	transmission) or sent by courier or three (3) days after being deposited in the United States mail, certified, with postage pre-paid
	and properly addressed, if sent by mail. For the purposes hereof, the address of the Note Holder shall be

	93 Grove Street,




	Somerville, NJ 08876

	may change the address for service by delivery of written notice to the other as herein provided.

	Note and any provision hereof may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed by the Maker and the Holder.


	 



	Assignability

	. This
	Note shall be binding upon the Maker and its successors and assigns and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors
	and assigns; provided, however, that so long as no Event of Default has occurred, this Note shall only be transferable in whole
	subject to the restrictions contained in the restrictive legend on the first page of this Note.


	 



	Governing Law

	. This
	Note shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.


	 




	Replacement

	or mutilation of this Note, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which
	shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, if mutilated, the Maker will make
	and deliver a new Note of like tenor.



	 



	Severability

	. In
	case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive in scope or otherwise invalid or unenforceable,
	such provision shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the maximum extent possible, and
	the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.


	 



	Headings

	. The headings
	of the sections of this Note are inserted for convenience only and do not affect the meaning of such section.


	 



	Counterparts

	. This
	Note may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall be deemed to constitute
	on instrument.

	This
	Warrant certifies that Charles J. Kalina, III (“Purchaser”), is entitled to purchase from


	Cross
	Click Media, Inc.

	, a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), 2% of the shares of total Common
	Stock (or any portion thereof) at a total exercise price of $1


	0,000

	,
	all on the terms and conditions hereinafter provided.



	Section 1.

	Certain
	Definitions

	. As used in this Warrant, unless the context otherwise requires:


	“

	Articles

	”
	shall mean the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect from time to time.


	“

	Common
	Stock

	” shall mean the Company’s authorized common stock, $.001 par value per share.


	“

	Exercise
	Price

	” shall mean the exercise price per share of Common Stock set forth above, as adjusted from time to time pursuant
	to Section 3 hereof.


	“

	Securities
	Act

	” shall mean the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	“

	Warrant

	”
	shall mean this Warrant and all additional or new warrants issued upon division or combination of, or in substitution for, this
	Warrant. All such additional or new warrants shall at all times be identical as to terms and conditions and date, except as to
	the number of shares of Common Stock for which they may be exercised.


	“

	Warrant
	Stock

	” shall mean the shares of Common Stock purchasable by the holder of this Warrant upon the exercise of such Warrant.


	“

	Warrantholder

	”
	shall mean the Purchaser, as the initial holder of this Warrant, and its nominees, successors or assigns, including any subsequent
	holder of this Warrant to whom it has been legally transferred.


	Section 2.

	Exercise
	of Warrant

	.


	(a)	At any time after the date
	hereof, and up until November 18, 2016, the Purchaser may at any time and from time to time exercise this Warrant, in whole or
	in part.


		(b)	(i) The Warrantholder shall
	exercise this Warrant by means of delivering to the Company at its office identified herein (i) a written notice of exercise, including
	the number of shares of Warrant Stock to be delivered pursuant to such exercise, (ii) this Warrant and (iii) payment equal to the
	pro-rata amount of the Total Exercise Price in accordance herewith. In the event that any exercise shall not be for all shares
	of Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder, the Company shall deliver to the Warrantholder a new Warrant







	1

	 









	 






	registered in the name of the Warrantholder,
	of like tenor to this Warrant and for the remaining shares of Warrant Stock purchasable hereunder, within ten (10) days of any
	such exercise. Such notice of exercise shall be in the Subscription Form set out at the end of this Warrant.


	(ii) The Warrantholder
	may elect to pay the Exercise Price to the Company either (1) by cash, certified check or wire transfer, (2) by converting the
	Warrant into Common Stock (“Warrant Conversion”) or (3) any combination of the foregoing, and specifying such election(s)
	in the Subscription Form. If the Warrantholder elects to pay the Exercise Price through Warrant Conversion, the Company shall deliver
	to the Warrantholder (without payment by the Warrantholder of any cash or other consideration) that number of shares of Common
	Stock equal to the difference of (I) the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant minus (II)

	Price. For purposes of this Section 2, “Value” per share of Common Stock shall be the difference, as of the date of
	exercise, between the Exercise Price and the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Company’s Board of Directors)
	of the Warrant Stock.


		(c)	Upon exercise of this Warrant
	and delivery of the Subscription Form with proper payment relating thereto, the Company shall cause to be executed and delivered
	to the Warrantholder a certificate or certificates representing the aggregate number of fully-paid and non-assessable shares of
	Common Stock issuable upon such exercise.


	(d)	The stock certificate or
	certificates for Warrant Stock to be delivered in accordance with this Section 2 shall be in such denominations as may be specified
	in said notice of exercise and shall be registered in the name of the Warrantholder or such other name or names as shall be designated
	in said notice. Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and the Warrantholder or any other person
	so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares, including to the extent permitted
	by law the right to vote such shares or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders, as of the time said notice is delivered
	to the Company as aforesaid.


		(e)	The Company shall pay all
	expenses payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2, excluding any
	transfer taxes resulting from the exercise of the Warrant and the issuance of Warrant Stock hereunder.


		(f)	All shares of Warrant Stock
	issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable,
	and free from all liens and other encumbrances thereon, other than liens or other encumbrances created by the Warrantholder.


	(g)	In no event shall any
	fractional share of Common Stock of the Company be issued upon any exercise of this Warrant. If, upon any exercise of this Warrant,
	the Warrantholder would, except as provided in this paragraph, be entitled to receive a fractional share of Common Stock, then
	the Company shall deliver in cash to such holder an amount equal to such fractional interest.


	(h) however, in no event shall the
	Warrantholder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which
	the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Warrantholder and its affiliates (other than shares
	of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Warrants or the
	unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous
	to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion
	of this Warrant with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by
	the Warrantholder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso
	to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided
	in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however, that the limitations on conversion may be waived by the Warrantholder
	upon, at the election of the Warrantholder, not less than 61 days’ prior notice to the Company, and the provisions of the
	conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Warrantholder, as
	may be specified in such notice of waiver).

	Section 3.

	Adjustment
	of Exercise Price and Warrant Stock

	.


		(a)	If, at any time prior to
	the Expiration Date, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is (i) increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of
	Common Stock or by a subdivision or split-up of shares of Common Stock, or (ii) decreased by a combination of shares of Common
	Stock, then, following the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the benefits
	of such stock dividend, subdivision, split-up, or combination, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to a new amount equal to the
	product of (I) the Exercise Price in effect on such record date and (II) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of shares
	of Common Stock outstanding on such record date (without giving effect to the event referred to in the foregoing clause (i) or
	(ii)), by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock which would be outstanding immediately after the event referred to in the foregoing
	clause (i) or (ii), if such event had occurred immediately following such record date. In addition, the Exercise Price may be adjusted
	in other circumstances set forth in Article 5 of Exhibit A of the Articles.


		(b)	Upon each adjustment of
	the Exercise Price as provided in Section 3 (a), the Warrantholder shall thereafter be entitled to subscribe for and purchase,
	at the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of Warrant Stock equal to the product of (i) the number
	of shares of Warrant Stock existing prior to such adjustment and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Exercise Price
	existing prior to such adjustment by (II) the new Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.


		(c)	If, at any time prior to
	the Expiration Date, there occurs an event which would cause the automatic conversion (“Automatic Conversion”) of the
	Warrant Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) in accordance with the Articles, then
	any Warrant shall thereafter be exercisable, prior to the Expiration Date, into the number of shares of Common Stock into which
	the Warrant Stock would have been convertible pursuant to the Charter if the Automatic Conversion had not taken place.


	Section 4.

	Division
	and Combination

	. This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation at the aforesaid office of the
	Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
	the Warrantholder or its agent or attorney. The Company shall pay all expenses in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery
	of Warrants under this Section 4, including any transfer taxes resulting from the division or combination hereunder. The Company
	agrees to maintain at its aforesaid office books for the registration of the Warrants.


	Section 5.

	Registration
	Rights

	. The Company agrees that if, at any time, and from time to time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall authorize
	the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-1, S-3, or S-4 in connection with the proposed
	offer of any of its securities by it or any of its stockholders, the Company shall: (A) promptly notify each Holder that such registration
	statement will be filed and that the Common Stock issuable to Holder upon exercise of this Warrant at the Exercise Price then in
	effect (the “Registrable Securities”) will be included in such registration statement at such Holder’s request;
	(B) cause such registration statement to cover all of such Registrable Securities for which such Holder requests inclusion; (C)
	use best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable; (D) use best efforts to cause
	such registration statement to remain effective until the earliest to occur of (i) such date as the sellers of Registrable Securities
	have completed the distribution described in the registration statement and (ii) such time that all of such Registrable Securities
	are no longer, by reason of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, required to be registered for the sale thereof by such Holders;
	and (E) take all other reasonable action necessary under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority to
	permit all such Registrable Securities to be sold or otherwise disposed of, and will







	3

	 









	 






	maintain such compliance with each
	such federal and state law and regulation of any governmental authority for the period necessary for such Warrantholder to promptly
	effect the proposed sale or other disposition.


	The right of any Warrantholder to
	request inclusion in any registration pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate if all Registrable Securities may immediately
	be sold under Rule 144.


	Notwithstanding any other provision
	of this Section 5, the Company may at any time, abandon or delay any registration commenced by the Company. In the event of such
	abandonment by the Company, the Company shall not be required to continue registration of shares requested by the Warrantholder
	for inclusion.


	In connection with any offering involving
	an underwriting of shares of the Company’s capital stock, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Registrable
	Securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the underwriters
	selected by it, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success
	of the offering by the Company. If the total amount of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders
	to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than by the Company that the underwriters determine
	in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering
	only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters determine in their sole discretion
	will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among the selling stockholders
	according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each selling stockholder or in such other
	proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by such selling stockholders).


	Section 6.

	Reclassification,
	Etc

	. In case of any reclassification or change of the outstanding Common of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision,
	combination or stock dividend), or in case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, another corporation
	or other business organization (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which
	does not result in any reclassification or change of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company) at any time prior to the Expiration
	Date, then, as a condition of such reclassification, reorganization, change, consolidation or merger, lawful provision shall be
	made, and duly executed documents evidencing the same from the Company or its successor shall be delivered to the Warrantholder,
	so that the Warrantholder shall have the right prior to the Expiration Date to purchase, at a total price not to exceed that payable
	upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such
	reclassification, reorganization, change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company
	which might have been purchased by the Warrantholder immediately prior to such reclassification, reorganization, change, consolidation
	or merger, in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Warrantholder to
	the end that the provisions hereof (including provisions for the adjustment of the Exercise Price and of the number of shares purchasable
	upon exercise of this Warrant) shall thereafter be applicable in relation to any shares of stock and other securities and property
	thereafter deliverable upon exercise hereof.


	Section 7.

	Reservation
	and Authorization of Capital Stock

	. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance such number of its
	authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Warrants.


	Section 8.

	Stock
	and Warrant Books

	. The Company will not at any time, except upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up, close its stock books
	or Warrant books so as to result in preventing or delaying the exercise of any Warrant.


	Section 9.

	Limitation
	of Liability

	. No provisions hereof, in the absence of affirmative action by the Warrantholder to purchase Warrant Stock hereunder,
	shall give rise to any liability of the Warrantholder to pay the Exercise Price or as a stockholder of the Company (whether such
	liability is asserted by the Company or creditors of the Company).

	Section 10.

	Transfer

	.
	Subject to compliance with the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, this Warrant and
	all rights hereunder shall be transferable in whole or in part. Any such transfer shall be made at the office or agency of the
	Company at which this Warrant is exercisable, by the registered holder hereof in person or by its duly authorized attorney, upon
	surrender of this Warrant together with the assignment hereof properly endorsed, and promptly thereafter a new warrant shall be
	issued and delivered by the Company, registered in the name of the assignee. Until registration of transfer hereof on the books
	of the Company, the Company may treat the Purchaser as the owner hereof for all purposes.


	Section 11.

	Investment
	Representations; Restrictions on Transfer of Warrant Stock

	. Unless a current registration statement under the Securities Act
	shall be in effect with respect to the Warrant Stock to be issued upon exercise of this Warrant, the Warrantholder, by accepting
	this Warrant, covenants and agrees that, at the time of exercise hereof, and at the time of any proposed transfer of Warrant Stock
	acquired upon exercise hereof, such Warrantholder will deliver to the Company a written statement that the securities acquired
	by the Warrantholder upon exercise hereof are for the account of the Warrantholder or are being held by the Warrantholder as trustee,
	investment manager, investment advisor or as any other fiduciary for the account of the beneficial owner or owners for investment
	and are not acquired with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof (or any portion thereof) and with
	no present intention (at any such time) of offering and distributing such securities (or any portion thereof).


	Section 12.

	Loss,
	Destruction of Warrant Certificates

	. Upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or
	mutilation of any Warrant and, in the case of any such loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of indemnity and/or security satisfactory
	to the Company or, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant, the Company will make and
	deliver, in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant, a new Warrant of like tenor and representing the right to
	purchase the same aggregate number of shares of Common Stock.


	Section 13.

	Amendments

	.
	The terms of this Warrant may be amended, and the observance of any term herein may be waived, but only with the written consent
	of both the Company and the Warrantholder.


	Section 14.

	Notices
	Generally

	and shall be sent by one of the following means: (i) by registered or certified first class mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
	requested; (ii) by facsimile transmission with confirmation of receipt; (iii) by nationally recognized courier service guaranteeing
	overnight delivery; or (iv) by personal delivery, and shall be properly addressed to the Warrantholder at the last known address
	or facsimile number appearing on the books of the Company, or, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, to the Company at
	its principal executive office, or such other address or facsimile number as shall have been furnished to the party giving or making
	such notice, demand or delivery.


	Section 15.

	Successors
	and Assigns

	. This Warrant shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
	permitted successors and assigns.


	Section 16.

	Governing

	US $7,600.00



	Las Vegas, Nevada


	June 19, 2015







	 


	For good and valuable consideration,

	CrossClick Media, Inc.

	, a Nevada corporation, (“

	Maker

	”), hereby makes and delivers this

	10%

	Secured
	Note (this “

	Note

	”) in favor of

	Charles J. Kalina, III,

	or his/her assigns (“

	Holder

	”),
	and hereby agrees as follows:


	 



	1. 	

	Principal
	Obligation and Interest

	.

	For value received

	,

	Maker promises to pay to Holder at

	8275 S. Eastern Avenue, Suite
	200-661, Las Vegas, NV 89123

	, or at such other place as Holder may designate in writing, in currently available funds of the
	United States, the principal amount of

	$7,600.00 (U.S. Dollars)

	. Maker’s obligation under this Note shall accrue simple
	interest at the rate of

	Ten Percent (10.0%) per year

	from the date hereof until paid in full.

	Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year or 366-day year, as applicable and actual days lapsed.



	 



	2. 	

	Payment Terms

	.



	 


	a.

	                  


	All principal and accrued interest then outstanding shall be due and payable by the
	Maker on or before six (6) Months from the date hereof (the “Maturity Date”).



	 


	b.

	                 

	Accrued interest hereunder shall be due and payable from Maker to Holder on a monthly basis, with the first such payment
	being due quarterly starting September 30, 2015, and future payments being due each three (3) months thereafter until the Maturity
	Date or until earlier redemption of this Note under the terms hereof.


	 


	c.

	                  

	At any time after the date hereof and before the Maturity Date, this Note may be paid or redeemed in whole, or in part on
	one or more occasions, at the sole option of the Maker.


	 


	d.

	                 

	All payments of interest hereunder may, at the sole option of the Maker, be paid in validly issued shares of common stock
	in the Maker, par value $0.001, issued to Holder. Common stock issued to Holder as payment hereunder shall be valued at a price
	per share equal to the average of the closing market prices (VWAP) for the Maker’s common stock during the twenty (20) trading
	days immediately preceding the due date for such payment.


	 


	e.

	                  


	All payments shall be applied first to interest, then to principal and shall be credited
	to the Maker's account on the date that such payment is physically received by the Holder.



	 


	 







	1

	 









	 






	 



		3.	

	Optional Conversion; Adjustments
	to Conversion Price

	.



	 


	a.

	                  

	At any time after six (6) months from the date hereof, the Holder shall have the right, at its option, to convert all or
	any portion of the principal and accrued interest due and owing hereunder into shares of fully paid and non-assessable Common Stock
	of the Maker at the 20 Day VWAP the day preceding the date of conversion, (the "Conversion Price"), subject to adjustment
	as explained herein.


	 


	b.

	                 

	If the Maker shall (i) declare a dividend or other distribution payable in securities, (ii) split its outstanding shares
	of Common Stock into a larger number, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number, or (iv) increase
	or decrease the number of shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock including any such reclassification
	in connection with a merger, consolidation or other business combination in which the Maker is the continuing entity (any such
	corporate event, an “Event”), then in each instance the Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the number of
	shares issued upon conversion of the sum due and owing hereunder will equal the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise
	be issued but for such event.


	 


	c.

	                  

	If, at any time in the two (2) years following the issuance of this Note, the Maker sells, grants any option to purchase,
	otherwise disposes of, or issues (or announces any sale, grant, or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock
	of the Maker at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price then in effect (a “Dilutive Issuance”),
	then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal the effective price per share of such Dilutive Issuance.


	 


	d.

	                 


	Notices

	.


	 



	                                                                   

	i.	Immediately upon any adjustment of the Conversion Price, the Maker shall give written notice thereof to Holder, setting
	forth in reasonable detail and certifying the calculation of such adjustment and the facts upon which such adjustment is based.


	 



	                                                                 

	ii.	The Maker shall give written notice to the Holder at least five (5) days prior to the date on which the Maker closes
	its books or takes a record (a) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon Common Stock, or (b) with respect to any dissolution
	or liquidation or any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or similar event.


	 



	4.	

	Mandatory Conversion


	.


	 


	a.

	   

		In the event that (i) the VWAP of the Corporation’s Common Stock is in excess of $0.125 per share for 10 consecutive
	trading days as determined by Bloomberg reporting,

	and

	(ii) the 90-day average daily trading volume of the Corporation’s
	Common Stock is above 100,000 shares, as determined by Bloomberg reporting, all sums due and owing will automatically be converted
	into the number of shares of Common Stock into which such sums would be converted on the date of such occurrence (the “Forced
	Conversion Date”), in accordance with the terms of this Note.


	 


	b.

	  

		The Corporation shall give to the Holder written notice of mandatory conversion at least ten (10) business days prior
	to the Forced Conversion Date, setting forth therein: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Holder’s Note
	is to be converted based on such Conversion Price; (ii) that







	2

	 









	 






	the conversion is to be effective on the Forced
	Conversion Date; and (iii) the address of the place or places at which this Note is to be surrendered. Such notice shall be sent
	by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holder at the Holder’s address of record. On or before the Forced Conversion
	Date, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Corporation at any place set forth in such notice or, if no such place is so
	set forth, at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. As soon as practicable after the Forced Conversion Date and the
	surrender of this Note, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to each such holder, or its nominee, at such holder’s address
	of record, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion in accordance
	with the provisions hereof.


	 



		5.	

	Registration
	Rights


	.


	a.

	                              

	The Maker agrees that if, at any time, and from time to time, the Board of Directors of the Maker shall authorize the filing
	of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-1, S-3, or S-4 in connection with the proposed offer of
	any of its securities by it or any of its stockholders, the Maker shall: (A) promptly notify each Holder that such registration
	statement will be filed and that the Common Stock issuable to Holder upon conversion of this Note at the Conversion Price then
	in effect (the “Registrable Securities”) will be included in such registration statement at such Holder’s request;
	(B) cause such registration statement to cover all of such Registrable Securities for which such Holder requests inclusion; (C)
	use best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable; (D) use best efforts to cause
	such registration statement to remain effective until the earliest to occur of (i) such date as the sellers of Registrable Securities
	have completed the distribution described in the registration statement and (ii) such time that all of such Registrable Securities
	are no longer, by reason of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, required to be registered for the sale thereof by such Holders;
	and (E) take all other reasonable action necessary under any federal or state law or regulation of any governmental authority to
	permit all such Registrable Securities to be sold or otherwise disposed of, and will maintain such compliance with each such federal
	and state law and regulation of any governmental authority for the period necessary for such Holder to promptly effect the proposed
	sale or other disposition.


	 


	b.

	                 

	The right of any Holder to request inclusion in any registration pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate if all Registrable
	Securities may immediately be sold under Rule 144.


	c.

	                  

	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, the Maker may at any time, abandon or delay any registration commenced
	by the Maker. In the event of such abandonment by the Maker, the Maker shall not be required to continue registration of shares
	requested by the Holder for inclusion.


	d.

	                 

	In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Maker’s capital stock, the Maker shall
	not be required to include any of the Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting
	as agreed upon between the Maker and the underwriters selected by it, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters determine
	in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Maker. If the total amount of securities, including
	Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities sold other than
	by the Maker that the underwriters determine in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then the
	Maker shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which
	the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities so included
	to be apportioned pro rata among the selling stockholders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein
	owned by each selling stockholder or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by such selling stockholders).

	of Maker enforceable in accordance with its terms.


	 


	b.

	traded in the future ("

	prior


	trading days including
	the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered by fax or
	other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes
	to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion
	may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of


	Common Stock to the Holder within 3
	business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Once the Holder has received such shares of Common
	Stock, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Company, executed by the Holder evidencing such Holder's intention to
	convert this Note or a specified portion hereof, and accompanied by proper assignment hereof in blank. Accrued but unpaid
	interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on
	conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share

	. In the event the Company
	experiences a DTC “Chill” on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 40% instead of 50% while that
	“Chill” is in effect.

	In the event the Company is not “Current” in its SEC filings at the time
	this note is cash funded, the discount shall be decreased to 40%. In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a
	conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its
	affiliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.


	 


		(b)	Interest on any unpaid
	principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest shall be paid by the Company in Common
	Stock ("Interest Shares"). The Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company for Interest
	Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall be all or
	a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice.

	(c)	This Note may not be
	prepaid, except that if the $26,500 Rule 144 convertible redeemable note issued by the Company of even date herewith is
	redeemed by the Company within 6 months of the issuance date of such Note, this Note will automatically terminate, as will he
	offsetting Holder issued $26,500 note.

	all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series of related
	transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the Common
	Stock, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not

	and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common
	Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a "Sale Event"), then, in each case, the Company
	shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid
	interest through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert the unpaid principal
	amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock immediately prior
	to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price.


	 


	(e) 	In case of any Sale Event
	in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so
	that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into
	the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such
	reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of
	Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this
	Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the
	consideration received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as determined by the Board of
	Directors of the Company or successor person or entity acting in good faith.


	 


		5.	No provision of this Note
