How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Past Life Healing by William Lee RandYou have lived many times before and your subconscious mind has a perfect memory of all your past lives. Often the original cause of a problem is in a past life and by going back to the cause it is possible to understand the lesson the problem has to offer and to release the problem for good. This CD is based on twenty years experience in guiding people back into past lives for healing and personal growth. It allows you to choose the problem whose cause you would like to explore and guides you in a safe and healthy way to understand and heal the problem. When using the CD, you always have control and can awaken at any time.
