Developers, City Move Forward on $54M Spec Office High-Rise in Downtown Raleigh
Locally based developer Dominion Realty Partners has joined Charter Square, LLC and the City of Raleigh to develop a speculative office project in the heart of the city’s downtown. 
Construction on the first of the two Charter Square buildings in the 400 block of Fayetteville Street is expected to begin this fall and take about a year to complete. At 215 feet, the structure will be slightly taller than the Marriott City Center Hotel across the street.

Locally-based developer Dominion Realty Partners has joined Charter Square LLC and the City of Raleigh to develop a speculative office project in the heart of the city’s downtown. 
Construction on the first of the two Charter Square buildings in the 400 block on Fayetteville Street is expected to begin this fall and take about a year to complete. At 215 feet, the structure will be slightly taller than the Marriott City Center Hotel across the street. 
According to the Triangle Business Journal, the cost of developing the 11-story Class A office tower amounts to $54 million. Designed to achieve LEED Platinum certification, the steel and glass building will offer 225,000 square feet of office and retail space, including direct underground parking and an outdoor plaza courtyard. 
So far, the property’s leasing commitments total no more than 35,000 square feet. Three of the four tenants are participating in the project: leasing agent CBRE, designer JDavis Architects, as well as the tower’s developer, Dominion Realty. The company will be located in the building to offer on-site management services. Additionally, G Patel of Eschelon Hospitality plans to open a restaurant in one of the structure’s corner floor spaces. 
“It is a big risk because it is spec … but I wouldn’t have committed to doing it without that site in downtown Raleigh,” Andy Andrews, president and CEO of Dominion Realty Partners told the newspaper. 
The downtown Raleigh area has one of the lowest office vacancy rates in the Triangle. Furthermore, the rental rate in the new building will be $29.50 per square foot, lower than other Class A office properties in the city.
“Charter Square will prove to be another driving force that brings businesses to our community and makes Raleigh one of the most sought-after places to live and work in the country,” said Mayor McFarlane in a news release.
Charter Square is a joint venture comprised of East West Partners of Chapel Hill, Craig Davis Properties of Cary, as well as two Raleigh-based companies, White Oak Properties and Beacon Street Development. The NewsObserver reports that in 2008, the group acquired the 1.75-acre Charter Square lot from the city for $5.28 million. Later in 2010, the developers completed a 550-space underground parking structure at the site, which the city acquired for $25.5 million. The team had also planned the construction of two mixed-use towers, but their plans were stalled because of the recession.

Waikiki Trade Center, a 22-story, 248,000-square-foot mixed-use high-rise in Honolulu will soon be repositioned into a yet-to-be-named boutique hotel.
Waikiki Trade Center in Honolulu
The building’s owner, San Francisco-based Coastwood Capital Group, partnered with San Francisco-based advisory and investment firm The Chartres Lodging Group LLC to complete the conversion.
Plans call for 230 spacious guestrooms, an eighth-floor pool and entertainment deck and a mix of street and mezzanine level retailers, the Pacific Business News reported. One of the retailers will be Nordstrom Rack, which plans to open its second Hawaii store at the center in the spring of 2016.
The cost of the entire project is estimated at approximately $61 million, with completion scheduled for the fall of 2016. Honolulu-based The Queen Emma Land Co. is the owner of the land where the building sits.
Kokua Hospitality, the management arm of Chartres Lodging, will provide renovation support, pre-opening tech services and property management services. Upon completion, the new hotel might operate under the Hyatt Centric brand, which caters to business travelers.
According to the newspaper, the redevelopment of the Waikiki Trade Center will bring needed hotel rooms to the market, which lost more than 5,000 rooms since 2000. At the moment, the high-rise is less than 20 percent leased and used primarily as an office building.

                visit and actions taken on those Sites, e.g. content viewed or searched for. If you are a registered user (e.g. a subscriber or taking a trial), when you 
                log on, this places a cookie on your machine. This enables your access to content and services that are not publicly available. Once you are logged on, 
                the actions you take - for example, viewing an article - will be recorded (subject to any necessary consents). We may use technology or a service provider

to fulfil our obligations to you;
to improve the efficiency, quality and design of our Sites and services;
to see which articles, features and services are most read and used

for marketing purposes (subject to your rights to opt-in and opt-out of receiving certain marketing communications) - see paragraph 3 below;
for advertising purposes, although the information used for these purposes does not identify you personally. Please see paragraph 5 below for more details;

                those of our other group companies. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving marketing communications and will in certain circumstances 
                need to obtain your consent before sending such communications to you. Further detail can be found on the applicable Site and in each marketing communication

Cookies and similar technologies

                All our Sites use cookies and similar technical tools to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide.
            

                Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and 
                sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when 
                you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Cookies cannot 
                be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in 
                the domain that issued the cookie.
            

                We may use cookies to:
            

remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. 
                    This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;
                
remember your login session so you can move from one page to another within the Site;
store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;
customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of Site for you;
record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;
collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site; and
gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a 
                    “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county 
                    and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements 
                    on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and 
                    about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk. 
                    (Please email us at cookies@euromoneyplc.com if you have any queries about cookies)


                Some of the cookies used by our Sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services (such as interest based advertising 
                directed at your market segment) on our behalf. To see a list of the cookies and similar technologies used on this Site and instructions on how to

                Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. 
                You can also learn more about cookies in general by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org

                turning off cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.
            

Email tracking: So that we can better understand our users' needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the 
                most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are 
                small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links 
                within the message. Any other purposes for which Euromoney wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used 
                for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.
            

Consents and opt-outs


                You can give your consent to or opt out of particular uses of your data as indicated above by:

Informing us by email, post or phone; or
Updating your preferences on the applicable Site;

Disclosures


                Information collected at one Site may be shared between Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, Institutional Investor Inc. and other group companies for the 
                purposes listed above. Your personal data may also be sold to other companies in the form of lists and directories, but only after permission from 
                you in accordance with the provisions above. We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties, including, without limitation, professional 
                advisers, or governmental or State institutions or regulatory authorities, where necessary in order to exercise or defend legal rights or where required by law.

                transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.
            

Public forums, message boards and blogs


                Some of our Sites make message boards, blogs or other facilities for user generated content available and users can participate in these facilities. 
                Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.
            

Transfers outside the EEA


                Services on the Internet are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always limited to one country. 
                Euromoney Institutional Investor plc may transfer your personal data, for the purposes listed above, to other group companies, service providers or other 
                third parties which may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may not give the level of protection to personal data as within the UK. 
                This will include transfers to Institutional Investor Inc. in the US (and Institutional Investor Inc. will collect some data directly from you, in relation to the 
                Sites which it operates) and to third parties who provide us with email and marketing services. Where we conduct any transfers we will take all steps reasonably 
                necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            
Confidentiality and Security of Your Personal Data
We are committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or alteration.
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the 
                security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and 
                security features described above to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have implemented information security policies, rules and technical measures to 
                protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification
unlawful destruction or accidental loss

All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and 
                are associated with the processing of your personal data, are obliged to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out 
                the services they are performing for us. We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as 
                credit card details and bank account number. How to Access, Update and Erase your Personal Information
