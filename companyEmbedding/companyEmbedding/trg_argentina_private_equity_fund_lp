The Rohatyn Group has acquired a majority stake in Eco Minera, an Argentinian mining service company. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Rohatyn Group (“TRG”), an emerging markets asset management firm, announced the successful completion of its acquisition of a majority stake in Eco Minera (the “Company”), one of the largest independent mining services companies in Argentina, through the TRG Argentina Private Equity Fund. Founded in 1996, Eco Minera specializes in drilling and soil movement services, and provides drilling services to exploration and production mining projects located in the largest mining provinces in Argentina.
TRG Managing Director Roberto Chute said, “Eco Minera has an excellent reputation with a successful 20-year track record and extensive industry knowledge. The Company has become one of the largest mining services company in Argentina on the basis of providing timely, reliable and efficient service to its clients. We are excited to further propel Eco Minera’s growth.”
TRG CEO Nick Rohatyn added, “The implementation of economic policy reforms by President Mauricio Macri has marked an important watershed in Argentina’s investment environment. The mining industry, which is still in early stages of development and remains heavily unexplored, shows particular promise for further investments due to the recent transition to a market-friendly administration.”
Enrique Martin, one of Eco Minera’s founders commented, “We are pleased to partner with a firm of TRG’s caliber and feel strongly that their support will be instrumental in our expansion plans. We will also look forward to leveraging their expertise in strengthening corporate governance to further enhance our best practices.”

TRG offers emerging market-focused products across asset classes in three primary business lines: hedge funds, fixed income, and private markets.  All of TRG's investment strategies employ top-down and bottom-up fundamental research capabilities to develop investment themes and strategies, as well as a broad array of hedging techniques, involving both emerging markets and G7 securities, to reduce volatility and enhance returns.  The firm's multi-product line construct is designed to create synergies across all of the firm's strategies, supporting information flow and overall performance.  TRG is able to leverage these resources to offer investors both traditional forms of exposure to emerging markets as well as customized solutions.  The current product line includes:
Hedge Funds
TRG's hedge funds employ an opportunistic, discretionary macro investment approach with a focus on global emerging markets.  The funds seek returns through investments centered around both fundamental macroeconomic themes and market dislocation opportunities.  Core directional and relative value investments are enhanced by dynamic asset allocation and selective hedging.
Fixed Income
TRG's fixed income products leverage the same comprehensive investment and risk management resources as the firm's hedge funds to provide investors with long-biased access to emerging market currency and fixed income markets.  As a complement to TRG's hedge fund offerings, which pursue absolute returns, the fixed income line of business targets outperformance relative to a variety of emerging market benchmarks.
Private Markets
TRG’s Private Markets team has been investing in private investment transactions in Emerging Markets since 2001, including investments in private equity, real estate, structured credit, and distressed debt.  TRG's private market investments follow a distinct approach that balances global perspective with local insight and execution.  The products are managed by highly experienced investment teams based in local offices with a successful track record of investments across regions and industries in emerging markets. 
TRG has expanded its private investing expertise through three acquisitions.  The first, the purchase of a 50% ownership interest in ARCH Capital Management Company Limited ("ARCH"), was completed in 2011.  Arch is an established Hong Kong based asset management company that invests in residential and commercial real estate projects with a focus on Greater China.  The second transaction was the 2012 purchase of a 60% ownership stake in Capital Advisors Partners Asia Pte. Ltd. ("CapAsia").  CapAsia is a Singapore-based mid-market infrastructure private equity firm focused exclusively on non-BRIC emerging Asia markets. The third transaction was the 2013 acquisition of Citi Venture Capital International, the Emerging Market private equity investment unit formerly owned by Citigroup Inc.
