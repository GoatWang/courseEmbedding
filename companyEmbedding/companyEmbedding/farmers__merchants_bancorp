Farmers & Merchants Bancorp Completes Acquisition of Delta National 
      Bancorp






November 21, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LODI, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Farmers & Merchants Bancorp (OTCQX:FMCB), a bank holding company 
      headquartered in Lodi, California, today reported that on November 18, 
      2016, it completed its previously announced acquisition of Delta 
      National Bancorp, the parent company of Delta Bank, N.A. (Delta Bank) 
      headquartered in Manteca, California.
    


      Farmers & Merchants Bancorp’s Chairman, President and CEO Kent Steinwert 
      said, “We are pleased to announce that Delta Bank is now part of F&M 
      Bank. We believe this transaction will benefit shareholders and clients 
      of both banks. Our new clients will receive a broader array of 
      sophisticated banking products while receiving F&M Bank’s community 
      banking style of service. Both banks share a passion for supporting the 
      communities in which they operate, and we look forward to continuing 
      that commitment.” The acquisition provides F&M Bank entry into both 
      Manteca and Riverbank, while enhancing its market share in Turlock and 
      Modesto.
    

      “As we complete the integration of these two organizations, the 
      combination has proven to be more valuable for our shareholders than 
      originally forecasted. We expect the merger to be immediately accretive 
      to earnings for Farmers & Merchants Bancorp,” said Steinwert.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
