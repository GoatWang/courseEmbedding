If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in effect. 
By reviewing or using the information on the Site after accessing the Site, you represent and warrant that (a) you have the authority to enter into these Terms of Use and create a binding contractual obligation, (b) you understand and intend these Terms of Use to be the legal equivalent of a signed, written contract equally binding, and (c) you will use the information on the Site in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations in accordance with these Terms of Use, as the same may be amended by the Firm online or otherwise from time to time. A printed version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based on or relating to these Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. 
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between the user and the Firm with respect to the Site and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and the Firm with respect to the Site.
