WuXi Healthcare Ventures said Tuesday it raised $290 million for its most recent fund, exceeding its $200 million target. WuXi Healthcare Ventures II, L.P. targets cross-border opportunities in the life sciences.
PRESS RELEASE
SHANGHAI, Dec. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — WuXi Healthcare Ventures (“WXHV”) today announced the closing of its $290 million WuXi Healthcare Ventures II, L.P., exceeding its initial target of $200 million.
The new fund builds on the successes of its predecessor fund launched in 2011, which invested in such companies as Juno Therapeutics, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Foundation Medicine, Callidus Biopharma (later acquired by Amicus Therapeutics), Novira Therapeutics, Twist Biosciences, Hua Medicine, and Adagene.  WXHV now has more than $350 million under management to execute its “find in U.S. and build in China” investment strategy.

The cross-border nature of our investment strategy and our appetite for early-stage innovation and entrepreneurship have aligned us well with the macro-trends in both countries.”
“The new fund is implementing a finely tuned investment strategy at a much larger scale than the predecessor fund,” said Edward Hu, CFO and CIO of WuXi PharmaTech.  “We are looking forward to continuing our collaboration with peers in the investment community and entrepreneurs around the world.”
“As the anchor investor and sponsor of this new fund, WuXi PharmaTech is excited about the vast opportunity ahead of us,” said Dr.Ge Li, Chairman and CEO of WuXi PharmaTech.  “This new fund will further advance our core mission of helping entrepreneurs in the global life sciences industry to realize their dreams of developing innovative products and services to benefit the world’s patients.”

Vast Ventures




































































 Vast allocates capital to create the world we want to live in - today! 











  Vast Ventures is a manifesto-driven venture fund investing in disruptive companies with global impact. ManifestoImprove world-wide health and happinessPromote resource sustainability for future generationsIncrease human potential and productivityIncrease knowledge, empathy and connectednessDisrupt industries that resist these goals Some industries we are disrupting... 



















Communication & Information

Vast's Vision:  How do you feel when your cell phone drops a call?  Or someone's late to a meeting?  Or you can't recall something?  These are lost moments and opportunities in humanities' evolution.  Vast seeks entrepreneurs making communication instant, anticipatory, fungible, universal and intuitive.  Some of Vast's communication & information investments: Astro Digital, EliteDaily, MeetUp, Moat, and Simply Measured.











Education

Vast's Vision: With ubiquitous on-demand information, we think education is learning about independent critical and creative thinking, assimilating and presenting information, and effective collaboration.  We look for entrepreneurs that are making these learning experiences fun, affordable and widely accessible.











Finance & Real Estate

Vast's Vision: Historically, finance and real estate have been accompanied by cumbersome documents, approvals and delays.  Currencies and real estate should move and transact as easily as information.  We seek entrepreneurs empowering people with instant access to currency and real estate, so they can spend more time accomplishing goals and less time processing.  Some of Vast's finance and real estate investments: Mighty, Ripple, StreetEasy, and Tala.











Food

Vast's Vision: Food is human energy and cultural celebration.  Yesterday's processed foods fed the masses, but today's innovation enables everyone's access to fresh, sustainable, nutritious, local, affordable ingredients.  Our taste buds and minds should crave fresh produce, not high fructose.  We look for entrepreneurs throughout the food chain bringing these innovations to the masses.  Some of Vast's investments are: SweetGreen, Juicero, Gobble, and Soma.











Happiness

Vast's Vision: We love that everyone pursues their own happiness.  We look for entrepreneurs who are improving goods or services that already make a lot of people happy.  Some of Vast's happiness investments are: Bark & Co, Eight, Fotolog, and Kiip.











Healthcare

Vast's Vision: Humans have been around about 2 million years.  We've learned a lot about survival, but we still know little about our health -- what is good health, is it the same for all?  We look for entrepreneurs challenging evolutionary thinking -- regeneration and restoration vs cures and relief; customization and accessibility; tracking and measuring in the background while delivering actionable reporting.  Some of Vast's healthcare investments: ClassPass, Kindara, Phosphorus, Recombine and ZocDoc.











Resources

Vast's Vision: Our global population is growing, increasingly demanding, and surpassing global resources.  We seek entrepreneurs that create sustainable and environmentally friendly resources -- all kinds: foods, fragrances, pharmaceuticals, gems, chemicals, materials, etc.  We also look for entrepreneurs harvesting resources beyond earth. Some of Vast's investments are: Ginkgo Bioworks, Diamond Foundry, Lygos, and Planetary Resources.











Transport & Energy

Vast's Vision: Americans love affair with cars ended in the 1960s.  No one wants to commute, sit in traffic, or wait for airport security.  We want people to focus on why they travel or transport goods, not how.  We seek transport entrepreneurs where safety, speed and sustainability are assumed, not featured.  Same for energy entrepreneurs -- focus on what users do with power, not how it's received.  Some of Vast's investments: FirstFuel, HyperLoop One, Keychain Logistics, and MPowerd.






























Inspiration, Collaboration & CommunityVast Ventures believes that ideas with global impact and that aim to do good make great investments.  Those ideas also create a platform for better ideas and accelerated improvement.  We look for opportunities to bring people together and to support events that inspire new ideas, collaboration and extended communities.  Some of our events include:Vast Ventures Necker Bowl 2015 With the generous hospitality of our friend Richard Branson, Vast Ventures assembled a group of entrepreneurs and forward thinking corporate partners to discuss global trends and opportunities for improvement.FT Philanthropy and Global Impact Summit 2016Vast Ventures is proud to sponsor FT's inaugural event in bringing together family offices around the globe who are focused on impact investing.
