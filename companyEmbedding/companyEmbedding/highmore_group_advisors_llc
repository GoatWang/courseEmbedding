About
Passion. Experience. Diligence.




About Our AdvisorHighmore is an opportunistic alternative asset management firm delivering market investments across core investment styles. The Firm focuses exclusively on alternative investments creating innovative solutions that seek to help investors manage portfolio risk. Highmore is led by a seasoned team of professionals whose collective resume includes experience at firms such as: Oppenheimer & Company, Citibank, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Man Group, FrontPoint Partners, Hines Real Estate, W.P. Carey, and Griffin Capital. Over the past twenty years members of the team have managed funds and developed multiple alternative investment strategies, overseeing assets in excess of $35 Billion. Highmore, in affiliation with US Bancorp’s Series Portfolios Trust, is proud to offer the Highmore Managed Volatility Fund combining the investment skills and experience of its’ team of professionals with select global investment managers. About Our FundThe Highmore Managed Volatility Fund is designed to be an effective component of an investor’s fixed income portfolio allocation to help respond to both low current fixed income yields and the possibility of future equity volatility. The Fund seeks to maximize return during market downturns while both attempting to maintain a low correlation to U.S. and World equity markets and provide stability through varied economic cycles.The Fund can invest in equity securities, debt securities and derivative instruments that can generate positive total returns over a full market cycle while overlaying a managed volatility investment strategy. The Fund can provide exposure to several sub-strategies often referred to as “absolute return” or “alternative” investment strategies. The Fund will employ these sub-strategies by allocating its assets primarily among a select group of experienced sub-advisors. Under normal circumstances, the allocation of the Fund’s assets to the sub-strategies and specific investments selected for the Fund will be made in a manner that seeks to limit the Fund’s annualized volatility.  Our Senior Management Team
