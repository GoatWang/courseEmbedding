	Forward Looking Statements




	 




	CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS




	 



	The information contained in this 10-Q
	includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
	of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking
	statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
	in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts
	or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements.
	You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words “anticipates”, “believes”,
	“continue”, “could”, “estimates”, “expects”, “intends”, “may”,
	“might”, “plans”, “possible”, “potential”, “predicts”, “projects”,
	“seeks”, “should”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions, or the negatives of
	such terms, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.


	 


	Forward-looking statements involve risks
	and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
	statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn,
	upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis of
	management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management’s
	expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking
	statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.

	SANCON RESOURCES RECOVERY, INC.






	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	For the three months periods ended March
	31, 2017




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Note 1.  Nature of Operations




	 



	Sancon Resources Recovery, Inc. ("Sancon",
	or "the Company", or "we", or "us") is registered in the State of Nevada. Sancon Resources Recovery,
	Inc. was dormant during the period.


	 



	Note 2.  Basis of Presentation




	 




	Unaudited Interim Financial Statements



	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements
	have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. However, certain
	information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles have been omitted or condensed, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
	In the opinion of Sancon’s management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation have
	been included. The results for periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. These financial statements
	and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended
	December 31, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 



	Note 3.  Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies




	 




	Use of Estimates



	 


	These financial statements are prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles accepted generally in the USA. These principles require management to use its best judgment
	in determining estimates and assumptions that: affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities; disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for such items based on historical trends and other information
	available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the relevant accounting
	rules, typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Actual results in the future could differ
	from the estimates made in the prior and current periods.


	 



	Earnings Per Share



	 


	Basic earnings per share ("EPS")
	is calculated using net earnings (the numerator) divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding (the denominator)
	during the reporting period.  Diluted EPS includes the effect from potentially dilutive securities.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets
	and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statement or tax returns.
	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statements and
	tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.


	 


	The Company operates in several countries.
	As a result, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various
	taxing authorities. Our operations in these jurisdictions are taxed on various bases: income before taxes, deemed profits and withholding
	taxes based on revenue. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves consideration of uncertainties in the application and interpretation
	of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.


	 


	We regularly assess our position with regard
	to individual tax exposures and record liabilities for our uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties. These accruals
	reflect management's view of the likely outcomes of current and future audits. The future resolution of these uncertain tax positions
	may be different from the amounts currently accrued and therefore could impact future tax period expense.


	 


	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements
	and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could
	have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.


	 



	Recent pronouncements



	 


	The Company has considered all new accounting
	pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on results of operations,
	financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.

	Note 4.  Going Concern




	 



	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate continuation
	of the Company as a going concern. However, after the disposal of its operating subsidiaries in the 4

	th

	quarter of 2011
	and became dormant afterwards, the Company has the stockholders’ deficits of $110,888 and $102,110 as of March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016 respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
	In this regard, management is proposing to raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations through loans, additional
	sales of its common stock or through a possible business combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful
	in raising this additional capital or in achieving profitable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.


	 



	Note 5. Related Party Transactions




	 



	As of March 31, 2017, the Company owed
	$28,700 and $78,880 to director and shareholder respectively.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company owed
	$17,400 and $82,737 to director and shareholder respectively.


	 


	On May 4, 2016, (i) 42,582,858 shares of
	our common stock, valued at $138,000 were issued in lieu of cash compensation for director and secretarial services from March
	13, 2014 through June 30, 2016; and (ii) 9,288,400 shares of our common stock, valued at $23,221 were issued in lieu of cash compensation
	for accounting services from December 22, 2013 through June 30, 2016.


	 


	During the period, KOK Seng Yeap, Eddy
	advanced $11,300 for the operation of the Company.


	 



	Note 6.  Stockholders’ equity




	 



	Stock options


	 


	On December 5, 2012, the Company entered
	into a settlement agreement with Dragon Wings for the settlement of the claim by Dragon Wings. In consideration of Sancon's agreement
	to make the payments in the form of common shares and share options listed in the settlement agreement. The Company would give
	the option to Dragon Wings to purchase 6,000,000 common shares; the option may be exercised by Dragon Wings in whole or in part,
	at any time within 5 years from the date of this settlement agreement with the exercise price at US$0.01 per share, with dilution
	protection and subject to share split adjustment.

	Note 7. Income Taxes




	 



	The Company has U.S. federal net operating
	loss carry forwards that if unused could expire in varying amounts in the years through 2020 to 2026. However, as a result of the
	acquisition, the amount of net operating loss carry forward available to be utilized in reduction of future taxable income was
	reduced pursuant to the change in control provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.


	 


	A 100% valuation allowance has been established
	as a reserve against the deferred tax assets arising from the net operating losses and other net temporary differences since it
	cannot, at this time, be considered more likely than not that their benefit will be realized in the future.


	 





	Note 8. Subsequent events




	 



	On or about April 5, 2017, the Company
	received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of Stockholders from a stockholder, who owns 53,596,540 voting shares representing
	approximately 51% of the 105,091,254 shares of the total issued and outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company (the “Majority
	Stockholder”) authorizing the Company’s Board of Directors, to effect a name change of the Company to IGS Capital Group
	Limited and a reverse split of the Company’s Common Stock on a 100-for-one (100:1) basis, pursuant to which the number of
	authorized shares of Common Stock will remain 500,000,000 shares and the par value for the common stock will remain $0.001, following
	such reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”); any fractional shares post-split will be rounded up to the next
	whole share.

	On April 5, 2017, the Board of Directors
	of the Company approved the above-mentioned actions. The Majority Stockholder approved the action by written consent in lieu of
	a meeting on April 5, 2017, in accordance with the Nevada Corporate law.

	The reverse split will not change the proportionate
	equity interests of our stockholders, nor will the respective voting rights and other rights of stockholders be altered, except
	for possible immaterial changes, due to rounding-up any fractional shares. The Common Stock issued pursuant to the reverse split
	will remain fully paid and non-assessable. The reverse split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a "going
	private transaction" covered by Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We will continue to be subject to the
	periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION




	 




	Item 2(a). Discussion for the Interim
	Operations and Financial Condition




	 




	Introduction




	 



	Management's discussion and analysis of
	results of operations and financial condition ("MD&A") is provided as a supplement to the accompanying financial
	statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
	of operations. The MD&A is organized as follows:


	 




	 



	·




	Caution concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors. This section discusses how certain forward-looking statements made by us throughout the MD&A and in the financial statements are based on our present expectations about future events and are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.







	 



	·




	Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, as well as recent developments that we believe are important in understanding the results of operations and to anticipate future trends in those operations.







	 



	·




	Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the three months periods ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A brief description is provided of transactions and events, including any related party transactions that affect the comparability of the results being analyzed.







	 



	·




	Liquidity and capital resources. This section provides an analysis of our financial condition and cash flows for the three months periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.







	 



	·




	Critical accounting policies. This section provides an analysis of the significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.






	 




	Forward-looking Statements




	 



	We have sought to identify what we believe
	to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized

	Limited Market Due To Penny Stock




	 



	The Company's stock differs from many stocks,
	in that it is a "penny stock". The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate "penny
	stock". These rules include, but are not limited to, Rules 3a5l-l, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6 and 15g-7 under
	the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities probably constitute "penny stock" within
	the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and our securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of
	our stock to sell their securities in any market that may develop for them. There may be a limited market for penny stocks, due
	to the regulatory burdens on broker-dealers. The market among dealers may not be active. Investors in penny stock often are unable
	to sell stock back to the dealer that sold them the stock. The mark-ups or commissions charged by the broker-dealers may be greater
	than any profit a seller may make. Because of large dealer spreads, investors may be unable to sell the stock immediately back
	to the dealer at the same price the dealer sold the stock to the investor. In some cases, the stock may fall quickly in value.
	Investors may be unable to reap any profit from any sale of the stock, if they can sell it at all. Stockholders should be aware
	that, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34- 29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent
	years from patterns of fraud and abuse. These patterns include: - Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers
	that are often related to the promoter or issuer; - Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales
	and false and misleading press releases; - "Boiler room" practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic
	price projections by inexperienced sales persons; - Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers;
	and - The wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker- dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired
	level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. Furthermore, the "penny stock"
	designation may adversely affect the development of any public market for the Company's shares of common stock or, if such a market
	develops, its continuation. Broker-dealers are required to personally determine whether an investment in "penny stock"
	is suitable for customers. Penny stocks are securities (i) with a price of less than five dollars per share; (ii) that are not
	traded on a "recognized" national exchange; (iii) whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system
	(NASDAQ-listed stocks must still meet requirement (i) above); or (iv) of an issuer with net tangible assets less than $2,000,000
	(if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5,000,000 (if in continuous operation for less than
	three years), or with average annual revenues of less than $6,000,000 for the last three years. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act
	and Rule 15g-2 of the Commission require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document
	disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting
	any transaction in a penny stock for the investor‘s account. Potential investors in the Company‘s common stock are
	urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be "penny stock".
	Rule 15g-9 of the Commission requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in
	such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor
	information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine,
	based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient
	knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor
	with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive
	a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial situation,
	investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for the Company's
	stockholders to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them.


	  



	Overview of the Company and its Operations




	 



	The Company sold all its business in the
	4

	th

	quarter of 2011. It has no business operation as of the date of this report.


	 



	Sancon's Visions and Goals




	 



	After the disposal of all its business
	in 2011, the directors are now looking for viable business that it can acquire in Asia.


	 



	Employees




	 



	As of March 31, 2017, the Company had no
	employees.


	 



	Factors That May Affect Future Results




	 



	The Company's ability to execute its business
	strategy and to sustain its operations depends upon its ability to maintain or procure capital. There can be no absolute assurance
	the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all. The Company's inability
	to obtain sufficient capital would limit the Company's ability to: (i) acquire new business and (ii) fund its working capital needs.
	The Company's access to capital may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results
	of operations.


	 


	 


	 








	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	There can be no absolute assurance the
	Company will be able to effectively manage its existing or the possible future expansion of its operations, or the Company's systems,
	procedures or controls will be adequate to support the Company's operations. Consequently, the Company's business, financial condition
	and/or results of operations could be possibly and adversely affected.


	 


	As a public company, Sancon is subject
	to certain regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	("SOX404"). Such compliance results in significant additional costs to the Company by increased audit and consulting
	fees, and the time required by management to address the regulations.

	ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 respectively. In addition, a substantial portion of our expenses for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 related to accounting and staff service fees, audit fees, legal and professional service fees, and for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016 related to accounting service fees, audit fees, professional service fees and transfer agent fees.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	 



	The preparation of our financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that
	affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base
	our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
	Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While there are a number of significant
	accounting policies affecting our financial statements; we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most
	complex, difficult and subjective estimates and judgments: allowance for doubtful accounts; income taxes; stock-based compensation;
	asset impairment.


	  



	Stock-Based Compensation




	 



	Effective January 1, 2006, the beginning
	of Sancon's first fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R (ASC 718), using
	the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the
	consolidated financial statements for granted stock options, since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under
	SFAS 123R(ASC 718) for non-compensatory treatment. Compensation expense recognized included: the estimated expense for stock options
	granted on and subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
	SFAS 123R(ASC 718); and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to, but not vested
	as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123(ASC
	718). Results for prior periods have not been restated, as provided for under the modified-prospective method.


	 


	On December 5, 2012, the Company entered
	into a settlement agreement with Dragon Wings for the settlement of the claim by Dragon Wings. In consideration of Sancon's agreement
	to make the payments in the form of common shares and share options listed in the settlement agreement. The Company would give
	the option to Dragon Wings to purchase 6,000,000 common shares; the option may be exercised by Dragon Wings in whole or in part,
	at any time within 5 years from the date of this settlement agreement with the exercise price at US$0.01 per share, with dilution
	protection and subject to share split adjustment.


	 


	For other items paid for by common stock,
	the value of the transaction is determined by the value of the goods or services received, measured at the time of the transaction.
	The corresponding stock value, used to determine the number of share to be issued, is the value of the average price for the 20
	to 30 days prior to the transaction date.


	 



	Item 2(b). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 



	There are no off-balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, that are material
	to investors.



	 







	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
	DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK




	 



	The information is not required of smaller
	reporting companies.



	 







	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 



	Under the supervision and with the participation
	of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of
	the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date").
	Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date,
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.


	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, there were no changes in our internal accounting controls or in other factors that materially affected our internal controls
	over financial reporting.

	RULE 13a-14(a)/ 15d-14(a) CERTIFICATION




	For Form 10-Q for the Period Ended March
	31, 2017




	 



	I, Kok Seng Yeap, Director, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial
	Officer and Secretary, certify that:


	 





	1.




	I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 of Sancon Resources Recovery, Inc. (the “registrant”);





	 





	2.




	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;





	 





	3. 




	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;





	 





	4. 




	The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:





	 





	(a)  




	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;





	 





	(b)  




	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





	 





	(c)  




	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and





	 





	(d)  




	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and





	 





	5.  




	The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors

	 

	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are identified by words and phrases such as "anticipate", "intend", "expect" and words and phrases of similar import. We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We encourage you to read carefully the other information provided in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law.  You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Related Notes in Item 8.  Overview  Sancon Resources Recovery, Inc. was an industrial waste recycling company with operations based in Australia and China. Sancon exported more than 4,000 tons of recycled industrial waste material annually to its processing partners and manufacturers in China. Sancon's main operations and services included industrial waste management consulting, collection and reprocess of recyclable materials such as glass, plastic, cardboard, and paper before its re-entry into manufacture cycles as raw materials. The use of recycled material is both environmentally friendly and is a key part of the competitive manufacturing process to lower costs. Chinese manufacturers are increasingly turning to recycled materials to lower costs. The major customers for Sancon were Chinese manufacturers and recycled material traders such as Pernod Ricard, Hing Yang Hong, which are located mainly in the Chinese provinces of Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Fujian.  The business operation of the Company was carried out through its subsidiaries. In 2011, the Company divested all its subsidiaries. The Company currently has no active business activities.  Plan of Operation  The Company is actively looking for acquisition and merger opportunities in growth industries in Asia.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Future events, however, may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. While there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting our financial statements; we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex, difficult and subjective estimates and judgments:  Revenue Recognition  In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Noted below are brief descriptions of the product or service revenues that the Company recognizes in the financial statements contained herein.  The Company was organized into two businesses: material recycling and waste management service. Their revenue recognition is as follows:  (1) Material Recycling refers to the activities of collecting and processing of waste materials, then selling them to customers in China. The plant is located in Australia. The revenue is recognized when delivery of the material is occurred and invoice issued.  (2) Waste Management Service refers the activities of providing waste management service with operations located in Shanghai China. The revenue is recognized when service is completed and invoice is issued.  Allowance for doubtful accounts  We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value. A considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of accounts receivables, including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required. We initially record a provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience, and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. In estimating the provision for doubtful accounts, we consider: (i) the aging of the accounts receivable; (ii) trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable; (iii) the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable; (iv) our historical provision for doubtful accounts;  Income taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109(ASC 740), Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS 109 prescribes the use of the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we increase or decrease our income tax provision in our statement of operations. If any of our estimates of our prior period taxable income or loss prove to be incorrect, material differences could impact the amount and timing of income tax benefits or payments for any period. In addition, as a result of the significant change in the Company's ownership, the Company's future use of its existing net operating losses may be limited.  The Company operated in several countries. As a result, we were subject to numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities. Our operations in these jurisdictions were taxed on various bases: income before taxes, deemed profits and withholding taxes based on revenue. The calculation of our tax liabilities involved consideration of uncertainties in the application and interpretation of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.  We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The tax liabilities are reflected net of realized tax loss carry forwards. We adjust these reserves upon specific events; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the contingency has been resolved and the liabilities are no longer necessary.  Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year.  Stock-Based Compensation  Effective January 1, 2006, the beginning of Sancon's first fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R (ASC 718), using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements for granted stock options, since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under SFAS 123R(ASC 718) for non-compensatory treatment. Compensation expense recognized included: the estimated expense for stock options granted on and subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R (ASC 718); and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123(ASC 718). Results for prior periods have not been restated, as provided for under the modified-prospective method.  On December 5, 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Dragon Wings for the settlement of the claim by Dragon Wings. In consideration of Sancon's agreement to make the payments in the form of common shares and share options listed in the settlement agreement. The Company would give the option to Dragon Wings to purchase 6,000,000 common shares; the option may be exercised by Dragon Wings in whole or in part, at any time within 5 years from the date of this settlement agreement with the exercise price at US$0.01 per share, with dilution protection and subject to share split adjustment.  For other items paid for by common stock, the value of the transaction is determined by the value of the goods or services received, measured at the time of the transaction. The corresponding stock value, used to determine the number of share to be issued, is the value of the average price for the 20 to 30 days prior to the transaction date.  Asset Impairment  We periodically evaluate the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including, but not limited to, property and equipment and intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses. We also utilize judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses, including the applicable discount rate.  Results of Operations  Two Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Revenue  The Company had no revenues in 2016 and 2015.  Other Income  We had other income of $1,230 in 2016 and $nil in 2015, attributable to the write-off of amount due to related party.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses increased to $85,643 for the year 2016, from $74,147 for the year 2015, an increase of $11,496. Of these amounts, $30,000 and $60,000 related to the value of cash compensation to our directors and secretary in each of 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, a substantial portion of our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to accounting service fees, audit fees, and legal and professional service fees, and for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to accounting service fees, audit fees, professional service fees and transfer agent fees.  Income Tax  No income tax was provided for the year 2016 and 2015.  Net loss  The net loss for the year 2016 was $84,413, compared to the net loss of $74,147 in 2015, an increase of $10,266.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had an accumulated loss of $1,219,286 as of December 31, 2016 compared to the accumulated loss of $1,134,873 for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was a working capital deficit of $102,110 on December 31, 2016 and it was $220,918 as of December 31, 2015. It decreased $118,808.  Operating Activities  $203,221 net cash flows used in operating activities for the year 2016 and $nil used for the year 2015, due to a significant decrease in respect of liabilities due to related parties and accrued expenses and other payable in 2016. The liabilities are settled by the issuance of common shares in 2016.  Investing Activities  No net cash was used in investing activities for the year 2016 and 2015. The Company did not purchase any property or equipment in 2016 and 2015.  Financing Activities  $203,221 net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year 2016 and $nil provided for the year 2015. The net cash flows provided for the year 2016 is due to the issuance of common shares.  The Company financed its growth by utilizing cash reserves and loans from directors. Loans from directors were unsecured, and deferred payment term and without interest bearing. The Company's primary use of funds was for investigating potential merger/acquisition candidates and for working capital.  Inflation  In the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of its operations.  Trends and uncertainties  Management believes there are no known trends, events, or uncertainties that could, or reasonably be expected to, adversely affect the Company's liquidity in the short and long terms, or its net sales, revenues, or income from continuing operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, that are material to investors.
