CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 29, 2013—Sulfagenix, Inc. (www.sulfagenixinc.com) is pleased to announce the issuance of a key patent related to its efforts to develop hydrogen sulfide prodrugs. The Cleveland-based pharmaceutical company is focused on developing medical foods, drugs and therapies that address unmet medical needs by modifying existing molecules to improve safety, bioavailability and efficacy.

U.S. Patent No. 8,361,514 provides for compositions of sulfur molecules that can be used to treat disease caused by oxidative stress. “Through our work and the work of others, we know that hydrogen sulfide therapy is very effective at preventing and treating cardiovascular disease in a variety of animal models,” says Dr. John Elrod, Assistant Professor at Temple School of Medicine and a co-founder of Sulfagenix. “We now also know that sulfur plays an important role in numerous other diseases associated with oxidative stress, including cancer and diabetes.”  
The products covered in the patent were developed by Mexican company Nuevas Alternativas Naturales Thermafat, S.A. de C.V. (NANT). The patent portfolio relating to these products, including this issued application, was licensed exclusively to Sulfagenix for use in all fields.  The inventor of these new compositions, Mr. Gabriel Gojon Jr., NANT COO and Sulfagenix co-founder adds. “Due to their increased bioavailability, these new compositions can provide a safe and efficacious means of increasing circulating hydrogen sulfide levels and, with this, the opportunity to treat numerous diseases.” Additional patent applications covering many other aspects of Sulfagenix’s platform are pending in the U.S. and abroad. 
Sulfagenix is undertaking an initial development strategy of demonstrating the ability of its lead product, SG1002, administered orally as a medical food to overcome the nutritional deficiencies associated with lack of dietary sulfur, initially for heart failure.  Patients with congestive heart failure have been shown to be deficient for circulating levels of hydrogen sulfide and Sulfagenix believes that SG1002 will provide a safe and effective means of increasing these circulating levels.  Sulfagenix is also developing additional products covered by these and pending applications for use in treating diseases associated with oxidative stress.

About Sulfagenix, Inc. Sulfagenix is a privately-held biotechnology corporation based in Cleveland, Ohio, and built on decades of research on modifying existing molecules to improve safety, bioavailability and efficacy for new uses.  The Company’s first product in development, SG1002, is a precursor to a natural-occurring molecule, hydrogen sulfide, for which deficits have been shown to exist in a number of serious diseases including CVD, Type II Diabetes, cancer, hypertension, Alzheimer’s Disease, cirrhosis, hyperhomocysteinemia, chronic kidney disease, GI tract irritation, asthma and wound healing. Sulfagenix was formed by executives from NANT and scientists in the US to pursue development of these novel molecules as medical foods and therapeutics.  Sulfagenix is currently raising Series A financing to support theses activities and expects to begin development work early this year.  For more information, visit www.sulfagenixinc.com.

Interview conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior 
	Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published  July 7, 2014

 


CEOCFO: 
	Mr. Giordano, what is the concept and foundation of Sulfagenix?


Mr. Giordano: 
We are based 
	on work that was started in Mexico in the early 2000s with a father and son 
	team, Dr. Gabriel Gojon, who is a PhD chemist, and his son, Gabriel, a 
	business person. They started thinking about diseases and what was key to 
	diseases. They hypothesized that hydrogen sulfide is very important in 
	diseases way back in the early 2000s, so Dr. Gojon and his son started 
	working on compounds, molecules and formulations that could improve hydrogen 
	sulfide levels. They went through a number of reiterations before they came 
	up with our product, SG1002, which through a single synthesis gives rise to 
	a couple products that are all natural products, but by synthesizing them 
	together, they dramatically increase the bioavailability of sulfur. They 
	then contacted a very well known cardiovascular researcher in the United 
	States, Dr. David Lefer, who was at Emory at the time. They sent him some of 
	their product to test in his animal models of heart disease. The product 
	worked beautifully, and David called me up. We were working together on 
	another company called TheraVasc, and he called me and said I had to see 
	this. He had tested many products for major drug companies and heart 
	failure, and this is one of the best he had ever seen. David introduced us, 
	and we started talking about how to develop this product. From there, we 
	started Sulfagenix and started the development of SG1002.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What specific condition is it addressing and what is the science?


Mr. Giordano: 
In many 
	diseases, there is oxidative stress, so there are free radicals that are 
	formed in the body that causes damage to cells. What this does is prevents 
	oxidative stress, prevents inflammation and it stimulates endothelial cell 
	function. These are the cells of the blood vessels and heart. So it is 
	improving function and reducing stress on the blood vessels and heart. For 
	these reasons we are developing this for heart failure.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How does it do so? What is happening when this drug gets into the cell?


Mr. Giordano: 
It is doing 
	two things predominantly. It is eliminating the free radicals, so it is 
	eliminating all the damaging agents, and then the second thing it is doing 
	is stimulating the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is the molecule 
	that has the profound effects on endothelial cell function. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	How and when would this be used?


Mr. Giordano: 
We believe it 
	is going to be used on a daily basis. The product itself is very safe, and 
	actually there is another really important aspect. All of us have 
	circulating hydrogen sulfide in our bodies. In our blood, we have hydrogen 
	sulfide, but with heart failure patients they have a lower level of hydrogen 
	sulfide than non-heart failure patients. It is a normal substance that you 
	could find in food, but unfortunately you do not get enough from food. 
	Hydrogen sulfide sulfur is plentiful in garlic, but you would have to eat 
	thousands of cloves of garlic to get what SG1002 provides. What we are doing 
	is giving something that will boost your normal levels of hydrogen sulfide, 
	and remember, in heart failure patients these are low. SG1002 boosts these 
	levels back up to normal. It is going to help the function of the heart and 
	reduce the damaging molecules that are there that could cause problems with 
	the heart. We think that once a patient is diagnosed with heart failure, 
	they should start taking SG1002 because of its safety profile and because 
	all we are doing is providing what the patient does not have. We believe 
	that they should stay on the product for the rest of their lives.

 


CEOCFO: Is 
	the medical community in agreement?


Mr. Giordano: 
It is a very 
	new field. I just returned from Japan where they had the third International 
	Hydrogen Sulfide Conference. It is still very early. In fact, Sulfagenix 
	gave the only presentation of clinical data at the conference. No other 
	investigator is even in clinic yet. We believe that this is a really crucial 
	pathway that is starting to gain recognition. The number of articles being 
	published are going up significantly each year and I think you are starting 
	to see more acceptance by the scientific community of the role of hydrogen 
	sulfide in diseases.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Where is Sulfagenix in the process?


Mr. Giordano: 
Right now we 
	are in the middle of a double blind, placebo controlled phase one study in 
	Australia. We are treating eight normal subjects and then following that 
	with eight heart failure patients. We are doing a dose escalation study. The 
	eight normal subjects have completed the trial. We see no real safety 
	issues, and with the dose finding study, we see very nice increases of 
	hydrogen sulfide levels in the normal patients blood. As I told you, 
	hydrogen sulfide should stimulate nitric oxide. Nitric oxide itself is very 
	unstable. When nitric oxide is made, it readily picks up another oxygen and 
	becomes nitrite. What we also see in the blood is a significant rise in 
	nitrite levels. We are very encouraged with the data from the normal 
	subjects in that we see safety, increased hydrogen sulfide levels, and one 
	of the outcomes of hydrogen sulfide should be production of nitric oxide, 
	which we believe we have demonstrated by observing the increase in nitrite 
	levels. We are now in the middle of eight heart failure patients in 
	Australia. We have three enrolled to date. One of them has completed the 
	three-week study, and two more are in the middle of testing. We are 
	screening others to get the last five enrolled in the study. We hope to have 
	that completed by the end of July.

 


CEOCFO: Is 
	this a pill?


Mr. Giordano: 
This is a 
	capsule.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What other conditions down the road might benefit?


Mr. Giordano: 
	In Mexico, before we got involved, a doctor friend of the Gojons, Dr. Arturo 
	Morales, tested this. He runs an infertility clinic in Mexico and he did a 
	great deal of reading and found that one of the big problems with 
	infertility is oxidative stress and damage to the sperm due to oxidative 
	stress. He started a double blind study where he looked at Resveratrol, 
	which is one of the molecules from grapes that is supposed to be a very good 
	antioxidant, a placebo, and SG1002. This was sort of an investigator 
	initiated trial. He did 18 patients per group. What he found was that 
	Resveratrol did nothing, but SG1002 had a significant increase in sperm 
	concentration and a significant reduction in sperm abnormality. He strongly 
	believes because of the effects on oxidative damage, that this would be very 
	beneficial for male infertility. Along those same lines, we have been 
	talking to a pharmacologist in Italy, Dr. Giuseppe Cirino, who is the 
	director of the Institute on Sexual and Reproductive Medicine at University 
	of Napoli, and he thinks that because of the nitric oxide stimulating 
	activity, this would also be a very good drug for treating erectile 
	dysfunction. We may be doing another trial in the future looking at this 
	products effects on male infertility and sexual dysfunction. I think that 
	is one that is way up there on the list. I was just at a conference in 
	Cleveland on nitric oxide, which had some sessions on hydrogen sulfide, and 
	one of the leaders in the nitric oxide field, Dr. Sol Snyder from Johns 
	Hopkins, gave a talk. Dr. Snyder pointed out that one of the key enzymes in 
	hydrogen sulfide production is missing in Huntingtons disease patients. 
	These patients may not be producing enough hydrogen sulfide, so there is 
	another opportunity that I think we should be exploring in the future.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are there any potential side effects to taking hydrogen sulfide?


Mr. Giordano: 
One of the 
	things that we know nitric oxide does is that nitric oxide is a vessel 
	dilator, so it opens up blood vessels. Since hydrogen sulfide will stimulate 
	nitric oxide, you have the issue of opening up blood vessels. Vessel 
	dilation can cause a drop in blood pressure, and it could cause headaches 
	and dizziness. What we have found at least within our normal patients is 
	that there was a very slow production of nitrite, which means there is a 
	slow production of nitric oxide, and none of the patients complained of 
	headaches or dizziness, which you typically see if you produce a lot of 
	nitric oxide at once. Nor did we see any real drop in blood pressure. The 
	hemodynamic effects that might be attributed to the nitric oxide piece of 
	this were completely nonexistent, so that was the big thing that we were 
	looking at. In Dr. Morales trial in Mexico and in our phase one trial, the 
	only complaint of these subjects was at the highest dose some of them 
	complained of feeling a little nauseous.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is your status as to funding?


Mr. Giordano: 
We are going 
	to be looking for funding later this year. We raised three million dollars 
	from investors in Mexico. We have some very good business people in Mexico 
	who have invested in the company, and that is allowing us to go through the 
	phase one study and allowing us to get the product ready and actually get 
	started on the phase two study, which we hope to start later this year in 
	Australia. We are developing this in a unique pathway as a medical food as 
	opposed to a drug. What that is going to allow us to do is get into the 
	marketplace very quickly. We expect that after the next study, we will have 
	the information we need to move this into the marketplace. What we will be 
	raising funds for later this year is to bring on a sales and marketing team. 
	We have already identified two very key people who we are bringing on. Both 
	of them are senior vice presidents with companies today, and one of them is 
	big in the pre-commercialization area while the other is big in the 
	implementation of sales and marketing. The Series B funding will allow us to 
	bring those people on, complete the phase two study and gear up for market 
	and product launch in 2016. 

 


CEOCFO: Why market yourself? Why that decision as 
	opposed to a third party?
	Mr. Giordano: 
We believe 
	that with the experience of these two individuals we will be able to do 
	this. The other aspect is that with the medical food, we are going to be 
	marketing direct to cardiologists and not necessarily to patients. We may 
	use a contract sales organization for sales function, marketing direct to 
	the cardiologist I think we will be able to generate and create enough of a 
	market that we can support additional development.

 


CEOCFO: What have you learned from past experiences 
	that has been most helpful and continues to be in this particular situation?
	Mr. Giordano: 
It is kind of 
	unfortunate but it makes more sense to keep your cost low and keep things 
	virtual as long as you can. In some of my previous organizations, we built 
	out facilities, we hired people and we built in many costs that were ongoing 
	costs that we needed to support. We were therefore constantly raising money. 
	In this operation, we have kept things very lean. We are outsourcing all of 
	our activities, so we can either speed things up or slow things down without 
	a big drain on our capital resources.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Put it together for our readers. We reach many people in health care and we 
	reach the investment community. Why Sulfagenix? 


Mr. Giordano: 
I think this 
	is a phenomenal product that is going to be safe, has utility in many 
	diseases and has a very rapid path to the marketplace that will benefit many 
	people and provide an excellent return on investment. We have a key patent 
	on producing hydrogen sulfide in the body, so in our belief, once we 
	completely validate hydrogen sulfide as a drug target in humans, people will 
	need to come to us to practice in this area. I think we are sitting in a 
	nice position both with our product and with our IP.

 


CEOCFO: Final thoughts?
	Mr. Giordano: 
The one thing 
	I would like to mention is that we are doing all of our clinical studies in 
	Australia, and I think Australia is a phenomenal place right now to do 
	business. Their regulatory path is very reasonable to get a product into 
	clinical trials, and they have a great refundable tax credit available for 
	doing research and early stage development in Australia. I encourage people 
	to really look at Australia. They have very high quality clinical sites, 
	CROs and manufacturing organizations. I am just really happy and excited 
	about the work we are doing in Australia.

Sulfagenix Inc. leverages the R&D Tax Incentive in Australia















                                    Sulfagenix Inc. leverages the R&D Tax Incentive in Australia

Sulfagenix, Inc., a United States based biotech, was able to tap into Australia’s world class research and development (R&D) facilities and expertise through the assistance of Australia’s R&D tax incentive.
Sulfagenix’s novel compound, SG1002, is a precursor to a natural-occurring molecule, hydrogen sulphide. Hydrogen sulphide possesses cytoprotective properties that makes it an ideal candidate for treatment of cardiovascular disease. Early stage research on SG1002 showed that it was able to decrease infarct size, improve cardiac function, increase angiogenesis, down regulate oxidative stress and decrease inflammation. Patients with heart failure are reported to have lower levels of hydrogen sulphide in their blood, even though sulphur is available naturally in the diet. Sulfagenix identified SG1002 as a potential treatment for heart failure by increasing the blood levels of hydrogen sulphide.
After considering possible locations around the world, Australia was selected as the destination for its first in man trial because of its straight-forward regulatory process and outstanding cardiovascular clinicians. As such, Sulfagenix Australia Pty Ltd was established for the purpose of developing SG1002 in Australia for the global market. In Australia, heart disease is the leading cause of death, affecting 4% of the population over the age of 45. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations suffer an incidence of heart failure 2-3 times that of the general population.
Sulfagenix was able to access the Australian R&D tax incentive program to conduct its first in man trial. The R&D tax incentive was introduced in 2011 and offers an attractive scheme where eligible applicants receive a cash refund of up to 45 % of their R&D activities. Sponsors with turnover higher than $20 million are eligible to claim a non-refundable 40% tax offset.
Sulfagenix worked closely with its tax advisors in Australia (Grant Thornton) to set up the Australian entity, and to ensure Sulfagenix was in compliance with the regulations concerning the R&D tax incentives. This included the engagement of an Australian Director and working with the R&D specialist at Grant Thornton to draft and file an Advanced Finding document with the tax authority.  From a financial point of view, a program where the estimated cost is more than $200,000 per year, this program can be very attractive.
The Phase I dose escalation trial in healthy volunteers and heart failure patients was conducted by Nucleus Network, a leading phase I unit. George Clinical was responsible for study management, clinical monitoring, data management, pharmacovigilance, medical monitoring, statistical analysis and medical writing.
The study was completed successfully in 2014.  The product was extremely well tolerated and although safety was the primary endpoint and very few subjects were enrolled in the trial, there is encouraging data suggesting a benefit to heart failure subjects.  Sulfagenix is now planning a small placebo controlled, double blind Phase IIa study in Australia to determine the safety of chronic administration (3 months) and to also assess clinical benefit to heart failure patients.
