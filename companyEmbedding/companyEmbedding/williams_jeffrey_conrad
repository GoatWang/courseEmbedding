                                            Jeffrey Nolan Conrad, one of four children of Harry Lynn Conrad and Mildred Lenore (Wilson), was born at Council Bluffs, Iowa on June 26, 1950.  The family lived on a farm in Mills County near Hastings, Iowa and Jeff was baptized at the Strahan United Methodist Church.  When Jeff was three, they moved to a Montgomery County, Iowa farm near Stanton, Iowa and two years later moved to a farm west of Red Oak, Iowa.  Jeff graduated from Red Oak High School in 1968 and enlisted in the U. S. Navy.  He trained in San Diego, California and Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Jeff served aboard the aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Ticonderoga as a parachute rigger and later served as a parachute tester for the Navy at El Centro, California.  He also took part in the aerospace recovery program.  After the Navy, Jeff settled in Arizona and worked for a short time as a driver for a copper mining company at Ray.  He then began his career as a guard in the State Prison at Florence and Yuma.  
     Jeff saw life as a series of adventures, his accounts of which were by turns hair-raising and hilarious. 
	Jeff's final illness with cancer was brief and he died at a Phoenix hospital on April 27, 2005 at the age of 54 years, 10 months, and 1 day.  
	 Preceding Jeff in his last great adventure were both sets of grandparents, three uncles, and two aunts.  He is survived by his parents, Mildred and Harry Conrad of rural Red Oak; brothers Joe Conrad and his wife Marlys of Red Oak and Mark Conrad and his wife Sarah of St. Paul, MN; sister Martha Kleinberg and her husband Bruce of Sarasota, FL; five nephews, Derek Conrad of Council Bluffs, Nick and Ben Conrad of St. Paul, Ben Kleinberg of Sarasota, and Joseph Sanders of Ft. Dodge, IA; nieces Sarah (Conrad) Sanders of Ft. Dodge and Rebecca Kleinberg of Sarasota.
