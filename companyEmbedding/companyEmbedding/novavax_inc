Clinical Stage Pipeline – Novavax


























































Clinical Stage Pipeline
Clinical Pipeline





Our product pipeline includes vaccine candidates engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses with the potential to provide increased protection. Our nanoparticle technology targets antigens with conserved epitopes essential for viral function. Unlike traditional vaccines that ‘mimic’ viruses and elicit naturally occurring immune responses to them, our nanoparticles are engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses, which may be more efficacious than naturally-occurring immunity. Our vaccine technology has the potential to be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseases.Respiratory Syncytial Virus F-protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (RSV F Vaccine)We are developing our respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (RSV F Vaccine) for three susceptible target populations: infants via maternal immunization, older adults (60 years of age and older) and children six months to five years of age (pediatrics). We believe our RSV F Vaccine represents a multi-billion dollar commercial opportunity. Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available.Repeat infections and lifelong susceptibility to RSV are common and we currently estimate the annual global cost burden of RSV to be in excess of $88 billion. Despite decades of effort to develop an RSV vaccine, there are currently no licensed vaccines. Although the monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis®) is indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk of RSV disease, it is not indicated for use in other populations. We made a breakthrough in developing a vaccine that targets the fusion protein, or F-protein, of the RSV virus. T The F-protein has highly conserved amino acid sequences, called antigenic sites, which we believe are ideal vaccine targets. Palivizumab, which also targets antigenic site II, has demonstrated protection in five randomized clinical trials.We genetically engineered a novel F-protein antigen resulting in enhanced immunogenicity by exposing these antigenic sites. The Novavax RSV F Vaccine assembles into a recombinant protein nanoparticle optimized for F-protein antigen presentation. We are seeking to bring the first RSV vaccine to market to combat the 64 million RSV infections that occur globally each year. [1],[2]               RSV Infants via Maternal Immunization ProgramRSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide.[5] In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants, and globally, is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age.[6],[7] Despite the induction of post-infection immunity, repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV is common.[8],[9]We initiated Prepare, a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine, in 5,000 to 8,255 healthy pregnant women in December 2015. The primary objective of the Prepare trial is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F Vaccine against symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection with hypoxemia in infants through a minimum of the first 90 days of life. This Phase 3 trial utilizes a group sequential design and is expected to take between three and four years to complete. We are currently in discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (FDA) about conducting an informational analysis of the Prepare trial in late 2017. These discussions lead us to believe we will be allowed to conduct an informational analysis that would provide an indication of the vaccine’s potential efficacy against the primary endpoint.The Phase 3 trial is supported by a grant of up to $89.1 million from BMGF. The grant supports development activities, product licensing efforts and World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification of our RSV F Vaccine. In 2015, along with the Grant agreement, we concurrently entered into a Global Access Commitments Agreement (GACA) with BMGF, under which we agreed to make the RSV F Vaccine available and accessible at affordable pricing to people in certain low and middle income countries.In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 50 healthy pregnant women and their infants. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine in pregnant women in their third trimester, and assessed the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine. The trial also examined the impact of maternal immunization on infant safety during the first year of life and RSV-specific antibody levels through the infants’ first six months of life. Immunized women demonstrated a geometric mean 14-fold rise in anti-F IgG, 29-fold rise in palivizumab-competing antibodies and a 2.7 and 2.1-fold rise in microneutralization titers against RSV/A and RSV/B respectively. In contrast, women who received placebo demonstrated no significant change in antibody levels. The infants’ antibody levels at delivery averaged 90-100% of the mothers’ levels, indicating efficient transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to infant. The estimated half-lives of infant PCA, anti-F IgG, RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralizing antibodies, based on data through day 60, were 41, 30, 36 and 34 days, respectively.In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 50 healthy pregnant women and their infants.

Fast Track designation is intended for products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. The program is designed to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. RSV Older Adult ProgramAdults 60 years of age and older are at increased risk for RSV disease due to immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the human immune system. In this population, RSV is an important respiratory virus, distinct from influenza, that is frequently responsible for serious lower respiratory tract disease and may lead to hospitalization or even death. Additionally, RSV infection can lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and congestive heart failure. In the U.S., the incidence rate is approximately 2.5 million infections per year, and RSV is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of 64 million older adults.[sup style="white-space: nowrap;">[3],[4] Based on our analysis of published literature applied to 2014 population estimates, the disease causes 207,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths among adults older than 65. Annually, we estimate that there are approximately 900,000 medical interventions directly caused by RSV disease across all populations.In January 2017, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of the RSV F Vaccine in older adults. The objective of this Phase 2 trial is to assess safety and immunogenicity to one and two dose regimens of the RSV F Vaccine, with and without aluminum phosphate or Novavax’ proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, in older adults. The trial is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial which has enrolled 300 older adults in the Southern Hemisphere. Participants were enrolled and vaccinated outside of the RSV season to best assess immunogenicity, with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2017.We announced top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults, known as Resolve, in the third quarter of 2016. Resolve, a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, began in November 2015 and was fully enrolled with 11,856 older adult subjects at 60 sites in the U.S. by December 2015. Historically, annual seasonal attack rates for all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD) of between 3% and 7% have been observed in older adults. 10 In our Phase 2 trial conducted during the 2014-2015 RSV season, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 4.9%, with an attack rate of 1.8% for moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD). In the Resolve trial, in contrast, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 2.0% and an RSV msLRTD attack rate of 0.4%. These unexpectedly low attack rates indicate a mild RSV season in older adults. The trial did not meet the pre-specified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy. The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD). The trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo and consistent with our previous clinical experience, the vaccine was well-tolerated.In September 2016, we announced top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults, known as Resolve. Resolve was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that began in November 2015 and was fully enrolled with 11,856 older adult subjects at 60 sites in the U.S. by December 2015. Historically, annual seasonal attack rates for all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD) of between 3% and 7% have been observed in older adults. 10 In our Phase 2 trial conducted during the 2014-2015 RSV season, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 4.9%, with an attack rate of 1.8% for moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), which aligns with peer-reviewed literature. In the Resolve trial, in contrast, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 2.0% and an RSV msLRTD attack rate of 0.4%. These unexpectedly low attack rates indicated a mild RSV season in older adults. The trial did not meet the pre-specified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy. The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD). The trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo and consistent with our previous clinical experience, the vaccine was well-tolerated. We continue to analyze data from the Resolve trial in order to better understand these results and to map a path forward for this important program. Our efforts include analyses of existing immunogenicity and efficacy data, and application of new assays to archived samples. We have also undertaken external epidemiology studies to further understand the attack rate, healthcare burden and seasonality of RSV disease in older adults. We expect these analyses to provide important information and context when we review the results from the Phase 2 clinical trial in older adults that we initiated in January 2017 and evaluate our next steps.The rollover trial demonstrated immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients, with a 6-fold increase in anti-F IgG in the Placebo-Vaccine arm, consistent with the Phase 2 efficacy trial. There was higher anti-F IgG at baseline in the Vaccine-Vaccine arm compared to the Placebo-Vaccine arm and the Vaccine-Vaccine arm showed a greater than 2-fold increase in anti-F IgG from the higher baseline. The rollover trial confirmed the low attack rates witnessed during the Resolve trial.In August 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 1,600 older adults. The clinical trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with RSV infection, in community-living older adults who were treated with placebo. The trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Finally, the trial estimated the efficacy of our RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to RSV. The trial was the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active RSV immunization in any clinical trial population. In the per protocol population, the clinical trial showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease (41%) and, in an ad hoc analysis, showed a decrease in RSV disease with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (45%) in older adults. The clinical trial established an attack rate for symptomatic RSV disease of 4.9% in older adults, 95% of which included lower respiratory track symptoms. Efficacy against more severe RSV illness, defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms associated with difficulty breathing, was 64% in ad hoc analyses. RSV Pediatric ProgramThere are currently approximately 18 million children in the U.S. between six months and five years of age. [10] In the U.S., RSV is responsible for approximately 57,000 hospitalizations of children under five years of age annually, the vast majority of which occur in infants less than one year old, and especially those under six months of age.[11],[12],[13],[14],[15]In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine, with one or two doses, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Trial enrollment was concluded with a smaller than planned cohort so that dosing could be completed ahead of the 2014-15 RSV season. The vaccine was well-tolerated and serum samples collected from a subset of 18 immunized children in the per-protocol population demonstrated that the RSV F Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all formulations and regimens. There were greater than 10-fold increases in both anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the adjuvanted group and greater than 6-fold increases in anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the unadjuvanted group. We are assessing the next steps in the development of our RSV F Vaccine for pediatrics. Seasonal InfluenzaInfluenza is a world-wide infectious disease that causes illness in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening or even death. Serious illness occurs not only in susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults, but also in the general population but also in the general population largely because of unique strains of influenza for which most humans have not developed protective antibodies. Current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccine growth in the top seven markets (U.S., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), show a potential increase from approximately $3.2 billion in the 2012-13 season to $5.3 billion by the 2021-2022 season.The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all persons aged six months and older be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza. Influenza is a major burden on public health worldwide: an estimated one million deaths each year are attributed to influenza.17 It is further estimated that, each year, influenza attacks between 5% and 10% of adults and 20% to 30% of children, causing significant levels of illness, hospitalization and death.18 Recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines, like the candidate we are developing, have an important advantage: once licensed for commercial sale, large quantities of vaccines can potentially be manufactured quickly and in a cost-effective manner, without the use of either the live influenza virus or eggs.After many years of developing seasonal influenza vaccine candidates as VLPs, we have identified advantages of developing a nanoparticle-based seasonal influenza vaccine. In particular, influenza nanoparticles can display conserved antigenic regions, which have the potential to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that may offer protection against a range of drifted strains. Additionally, nanoparticles offer improved purity and manufacturability and advantages for co-formulation with other nanoparticle-based vaccines. We expect to continue to develop our nanoparticle influenza vaccine program into 2017 with an ongoing goal of generating additional proof-of-concept data. Combination Respiratory Vaccine (Influenza and RSV)Given the ongoing development of our RSV F Vaccine and our nanoparticle-based seasonal influenza vaccines, we continue to believe in the long-term opportunity to develop a combination RSV/influenza respiratory vaccine. Early preclinical development efforts give us confidence that such a combination vaccine is feasible.Emerging DiseaseEbola VirusEbola virus (EBOV), formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Multiple strains of EBOV have been identified, the most recent of which, the Makona strain, is associated with a case fatality rate of between 50% and 90%. There are currently no licensed treatments proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development. Despite the development of such therapies, current vaccine approaches target either a previous strain of the virus or were initially developed to be delivered by genetic vectors. In contrast, our EBOV glycoprotein vaccine candidate (Ebola GP Vaccine)was developed using the Makona EBOV strain.  In July 2015, we announced data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our Ebola GP Vaccine in ascending doses, with and without our Matrix-M adjuvant, in 230 healthy adults. Participants received either one or two intramuscular injections with or without adjuvant, or placebo, and immunogenicity was assessed at multiple time points, including days 28 and 35. These Phase 1 data demonstrated that our Ebola GP Vaccine is highly immunogenic, well-tolerated and, in conjunction with our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, resulted in significant antigen dose-sparing. Although the adjuvanted Ebola GP Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all dose levels, the adjuvanted two-dose regimens induced Ebola anti-GP antibody geometric mean responses between 45,000 and 70,000 ELISA units, representing a 500 to 750-fold rise over baseline at day 35. In 2015, we also announced successful data from two separate non-human primate challenge studies of our Ebola GP Vaccine in which, in both cases, the challenge was lethal for the control animal, whereas 100% of the immunized animals were protected. ZIKV EnvD VaccineWe initiated development of a vaccine against the Zika virus (ZIKV) in response to the unmet global medical need for a response to this serious disease. Beginning in 2015, ZIKV spread in South, Central and North America via mosquito-borne and sexual transmission. Although acute ZIKV infections in adults are generally either asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms (fever, joint pains and skin rash), more serious outcomes can occur, including Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and, microcephaly in infants of women infected during pregnancy. There is no approved vaccine against ZIKV, although a number of companies have announced vaccine development efforts. We are currently conducting IND-enabling preclinical studies, including studies in non-human primates and other animal models, with the goal of initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial of our ZIKV envelope dimer nanoparticle vaccine candidate (ZIKV EnvD Vaccine) in 2017.   1 Nair, H. et al., (2010) Lancet. 375:1545 - 15552 WHO Acute Respiratory Infections September 2009 Update: http://apps.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/ari/en/index2.html3 Falsey, A.R. et al.

Novavax, Inc. is a clinical-stage vaccine company headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland with additional facilities in Rockville, Maryland and Uppsala, Sweden. Novavax is a public company that trades under the symbol "NVAX".[3]
In June 2013, Novavax acquired the Matrix-MTM adjuvant platform with the purchase of Swedish company Isconova AB and renamed it Novavax AB.[4]
In 2015 the company received an $89 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support the development of a vaccine against human respiratory syncytial virus for infants via maternal immunization.[5][6][7][8]
In March 2015 the company completed a Phase I trial for its Ebola vaccine candidate.[9]
In September 2016 the company announced that a Phase III trial of its RSV vaccine had failed to meet its endpoints, which caused its share price to fall from $8.34 to $1.40[10] and led the company to lay off 30% of its employees.[2]
As of November 2016 its RSV F vaccine candidate was in three clinical trials.[2][11][12][13]

Novavax's Pipeline: Plenty Of Ammunition - Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Novavax's Pipeline: Plenty Of AmmunitionJun. 1.17 | About: Novavax, Inc. (NVAX) Upside Research Long/short equity, Deep Value, value, growth at reasonable priceSummaryWidespread misinformation in articles and comments has caused fear among investors, resulting in a great buying opportunity.
        One of the main areas of incorrect information is the claim that Novavax had only one backup or no backups to its older adults RSV vaccine.
        In fact, the company and its partners have 12 product candidates, four of which would each produce over $1 billion in revenue.
        Novavax also has several funding options for funding its cash needs in the future.
        When seeking alpha, one of the best ways to "find alpha" is to follow Warren Buffett's core advice to "Buy fear, sell greed." In the case of Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), excessive irrational fear has come from three things: 1) Lack of awareness of the well-documented science that low attack rate seasons make vaccine trials useless in evaluating efficacy. As described in my last article, Novavax's phase 3 trial of its older adults RSV vaccine took place during the lowest attack rate season on record. The result caused a fear that the older adults RSV vaccine has almost no chance of succeeding. 2) The normal dynamics related to technicals and momentum: when a stock declines, some people become fearful and sell based on emotion. Others avoid buying. Trend momentum traders pile on (sometimes via computer algorithms), short selling the stock to capitalize on the trend. This causes investors more pain and makes them feel even more fearful, which leads to more selling and more fear. A classic vicious circle, and one that is a great place to look for a great buying opportunity. Over the last two weeks, we've started to see the momentum move in the opposite direction, as the stock has gained more than 25%. The things like technical and momentum trading that hurt a stock on the way down often help it on the way up. I think this is probably going to help NVAX in the coming weeks and months. 3) A torrent of incorrect information in media articles and from short-sellers. As this Investopedia article states: an "advantage in investing in small-cap stocks is the potential for discovering unknown value. The general rule of the investment world is that the majority of Wall Street research is aimed at a fraction of publicly traded companies, and most of these companies are large cap. Small-cap companies fly more under the radar, and therefore hold greater potential for finding undervalued stocks."
 Misinformation is far worse than a lack of information for a stock's price. But it also means a far greater opportunity to gain from the gap between the misinformation and the correct information. To be fair, information being off a small amount of time is reasonable. Nobody is perfect, and everybody from time to time gets a detail wrong. However, the sheer quantity of false claims about Novavax is staggering, and indicates some likelihood of a smear campaign on the part of short sellers aiming to profit from the misinformation.  This article will focus on the false assertions that Novavax had no back-ups in place, or only had one back-up in its pipeline. For example, this Motley Fool article claims: "What makes this biotech stock so risky, though, is the lack of backup candidates in the company's clinical-stage pipeline." In fact, the company has numerous vaccines in its pipeline including: 

 Zika vaccine Last November, Novavax said its Zika preclinical data showed the company's vaccine technology produces "uniquely neutralizing antibodies" at levels considered well above necessary for protection. Since then, Novavax has been partnering with Harvard University's Center for Virology and Vaccine Research. The center's Director, Dr. Dan Barouch, has been doing nonhuman primate studies of Novavax's vaccine with positive results. The company plans to do a phase 1 trial on humans later this year. On May 28 of this year, the Indian government reported the first three cases of Zika in the country. This is significant news because the population of the country is 1.3 billion people. During the winter, the weather is cold in most of the United States, so awareness of the threat of Zika has recently faded from people's minds. However, scientists say that the unusually warm winter means that the populations of mosquitos that carry Zika will be high this year.
 On the company's Q4 conference call in February, Piper Jaffray's senior biotech research analyst, Edward Tenthoff, said: "I don't think this is going away by any means." To make matters worse, biologists discovered in April "the disturbing news that a second type of mosquito common in Florida, the Aedes albopictus, also can carry Zika … The Aedes albopictus' habitat extends to Maine and Minnesota, farther north into the United States than the Aedes aegypti's range. So Smartt's finding raises the possibility of Zika outbreaks farther north." A study published May 24 in the journal Nature revealed that Zika usually spreads to new areas 4 to 12 months before it's even detected, so it very possible it will spread to more U.S. states before those states discover the problem. While Zika in the U.S. may never reach the levels it has in other countries, the fact that it can be transmitted sexually and can have severe effects such as microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrone in adults means "it is possible that broad vaccination against Zika, much like is done with HPV could be recommended," wrote Cantor Fitzgerald's analyst, William Tanner in a research note to investors in January. As the Washington Post notes, "Babies born to Zika-infected mothers have been found to have microcephaly, or a birth defect where the head is abnormally small and brains might not have developed properly. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system." In this article in the New England Journal of Medicine, a group of vaccine experts states that HPV vaccination begins at ages 9 to 12, and that a similar approach should be used for Zika: "Given the need to protect girls before they reach childbearing age, a TPP should address vaccination starting at 9 years of age and in people of both sexes, given evidence of ZIKV in semen up to 6 months after infection. This starting age would align with WHO recommendations and with the precedent set by human papillomavirus vaccines."
 They said this should be done even if the levels of infection subside, due to the risks of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, and the fact that the virus is sexually transmitted. They said 100 million doses will be needed annually in the U.S. alone. That is an enormous market opportunity. If the vaccines sell for $50, that is $5 billion in revenues annually in the U.S. alone, which is larger than the market for RSV, which is limited to infants and adults over 65. The vaccine for pneumonia sells for about $180, so on the upside, it's entirely possible a Zika vaccine could sell for more than $50 and the market opportunity could be bigger than above. Also, the U.S. is only one market and Zika is an international problem. On the downside, it's also entirely possible that Novavax's vaccine won't succeed given that it's early in the development process. When valuing biotech stocks, the most common approach is the discounted free cash flow approach in which you take the expected amount of sales if a product is approved and then reduce that by the chances that it will be approved and by the cost of developing the product. Only about 5% of drugs that start the development process make it through to approval, so in doing your calculation, you probably shouldn't give it better than a 5% chance. However, the market opportunity is huge. In addition, if the phase 1 trial is positive, the costs of developing the Zika vaccine have a good chance of being paid for by governments and/or foundations. Novavax's President of Research and Development, Dr. Greg Glenn, in February said: "I don't think there's ever been a precedent like this with respect to a virus causing such severe outcome Guillain-Barré and birth defects. So, I think that the government seems to be quite committed to seeing the vaccine pull through." The article above plus a second article in the New England Journal of Medicine both said rapid development of a vaccine is needed. If the trial is successful, there's a reasonable chance that the U.S. government, foreign government's such as India's and/or charitable foundations will fund development of the vaccine. If not, Novavax will probably partner with a larger company to fund the phase 2 and 3 trials in exchange for a percentage of future profits.
 Last year Glenn said, "We will work with various government and nongovernment groups to determine the pathway forward to fund our large-scale production and clinical trials." In November, Buck Phillips, Novavax's CFO, said: "We think the U.S. government is recognizing this is an important pathogen, and we know that there is funding activity going on. I think we will be poised to start to try to obtain that funding in the coming year." James Cummings, Vice President of Clinical Development and Translational Medicine, added that Novavax is "looking at multiple lines of external funding from other government sources as well as from BARDA." Regarding the Zika vaccine, CEO Stan Erck noted: "An additional economic benefit is the potential to receive a priority review voucher under the FDA's program. In recent years, these vouchers have turned out to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars." He noted that Novavax has "a promising track record of obtaining fast-track designation from the FDA." He's referring to the Food and Drug Administration's priority review program in which they give out lucrative fast-track vouchers. As the Washington Business Journal notes, these vouchers are bought and sold by companies, and in recent years, they have sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. Maternal RSV Vaccine While most articles about Novavax have mentioned its current phase 3 trial of its maternal RSV vaccine, there has been significant misinformation about the vaccine. Writers at the Motley Fool have been among the worst offenders. For example, a few articles including this one earlier this year, have implied that the phase 3 trial won't be completed for another four years. In fact, the trial could take as little as three years, and started earlier than planned. In addition, the trial is already past the mid-way point, and Novavax is expected to do an interim informational analysis of the results later this year. As of last November, the company reported it had already completed year one in the U.S., South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Chile. In February, the company said it was at the mid-way point of the trial. Yes it has some time to go, but implying that investors will have to wait for four years is wrong.
 Another common claim has been that the maternal RSV vaccine has only a slim chance of succeeding due to the older adults phase 3 trial not succeeding. This is incorrect in two ways. Firstly, articles and commenters who make this claim fail to mention the scientific data and consensus that low attack rate seasons make trials meaningless in assessing efficacy. Low attack rate seasons require a do-over. Even in the rare couple of instances that articles mention the low attack rate season, they frame it as a false excuse on the part of the company, and don't even mention the extensive scientific data. Secondly, the maternal RSV vaccine is different than the older adults RSV vaccine. They use different mechanisms of action. So even if the mechanism of action in the older adults vaccine turns out to fail, it doesn't mean the mechanism of the maternal vaccine will also fail. In addition, RSV attack rates are more consistent among infants than older adults, so the chance of a low attack rate season is low. Plus, the maternal RSV vaccine is being done over the course of about 5 to 6 RSV seasons (2-3 in the northern hemisphere and 2-3 in the southern hemisphere), so even if there is one low attack rate season, it won't prevent the results from being usable. Some of the other misinformation about the maternal vaccine has been subtler. In this article, the writer says, "While Novavax chose to push forward with its maternal immunization program anyway, I think that the risk of another failure is unfortunately quite high." That implies Novavax is imprudently pushing forward with spending its money on the maternal trial when it should not be. In fact, the program is being paid for by the Gates Foundation, so it would not make sense to end it. It also likely would be in violation of its contract with the Gates Foundation, which could result in a lawsuit. The writer conveys that continuing the trial is stupid, when the opposite is the case: ending it would be stupid. In fact, in November the company said the maternal RSV vaccine program would be its "primary focus" in the coming months, and rightly so. Even the bears agree that if the vaccine is approved, it will probably have annual sales of over $1 billion. As this Motley Fool bear says, "With respect to infant mortality worldwide, the RSV virus is second only to malaria, and an FDA green light for this indication would almost certainly result in annual sales of over $1 billion."
 Every year about 4 million new babies are born in the U.S. Almost all analysts agree sales would be over $1 billion. The normal price to sales multiple of biotech companies is between 5 and 7. Using a multiple of 6, NVAX would likely have a market cap of $6 billion, which is 2,100% higher than its current market cap of about $280 million from that one vaccine alone. Conveying that Novavax is being rash to continue a trial being paid for by someone else that could result in a 2,100% gain is ludicrous. Older Adults RSV Vaccine In the same article, the Motley Fool author misrepresents the new phase 2 trial of the older adults vaccine, saying, "Unfortunately … the double-dose regimen in older adults is intended for just 300 patients. By comparison, the previously successful study that lifted hopes enrolled about 1,600 patients." He doesn't at all understand the goal of the current phase 2 trial. It's not in any way, shape or form trying to emulate the previous phase 2. After the low attack rate season, since a do-over was needed, the company could have simply re-ran the same trial again with a single dose. It might well still do that. However, it decided to test the immune responses that occur if the same vaccine is combined with different adjuvants, and if two doses are given. If the physical immune levels go higher with one of those approaches (that use the same exact vaccine), then it will run a similar phase 3 trial with that approach. There is no need to re-do a large sized phase 2 with 1,600 patients for the vaccine. 300 patients is enough for measuring physical immunological responses to find the best method of delivery of the same vaccine. For full details on the current phase 2, see the last article I wrote. And just for some context related to attack rates, in early 2015 during its original phase 2 of the older adults vaccine, the company said the lowest attack rate that would be viable for evaluating efficacy would be 3%, "I think we want to see an attack rate in RSV that looks like the literature. So somewhere between 3% to 7% would be an acceptable attack rate in our view."
 The attack rate in the season of the phase 3 trial was under .5%, which is six times lower than the low end of the acceptable range for assessing efficacy. After the phase 3, CEO Stan Erck noted: "We have a preponderance of data that tell a consistent story of the effectiveness of our vaccine. Over many years, we have consistently shown in well accepted animal models that our vaccine stimulates a robust immune response in every way that we could measure…. we have consistently shown … that our vaccine protects these animals when vaccinated and then challenged with RSV. And in 9 clinical trials with pediatrics, women of child-bearing age, pregnant women, healthy adults and in the older adult population, we have consistently shown robust immune system responses by every measurement that we have." The low attack rate trial was the only trial out of a large amount of trials that hasn't shown efficacy and the only difference between it and all the others is that the RSV attack rate was far lower than normal. So attempts to claim the RSV vaccine has little chance of success are dubious. Seasonal Flu Vaccine The strains of the flu change every year, and vaccine makers do their best to predict what strains to vaccinate people against. The central problem is that current vaccines use an approach involving egg embryos, and the process of manufacturing the vaccines takes about 4 to 6 months. So the vaccine experts must choose several months ahead of time which strains to include in the upcoming season's shot. By the time the season arrives, it many times turns out to be a different strain, or has mutated into a new strain. Novavax's recombinant nanoparticle technology doesn't use egg embryos, so it can manufacture its vaccine in half the time that current flu vaccines require. Thus, if it's flu vaccine is successful, it will have a huge advantage over other flu vaccines. Experts will be able to wait until two months before the flu season begins to choose which strains to include in the shot. This would dramatically increase the chances that they make the right picks.
 Vernon Bernardino, the analyst at FBR Capital Markets said Novavax's vaccine "would definitely be a highly differentiated vaccine, creating a new paradigm for sure." Novavax is doing a phase 1 trial of its seasonal flu vaccine later this year, which also uses its Matrix M technology. A report by Global Data said, "Clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of Matrix-M on existing seasonal influenza vaccine formulations in the elderly have reported increased seroconversion and seroprotection rates of virus H neutralization antibodies compared with unadjuvanted controls. Capitalizing on its nanoparticle platform, Novavax is spearheading what GlobalData anticipates to be a paradigm shift in seasonal influenza vaccine design." The seasonal flu vaccine is early in the process so you probably shouldn't be assigning it more than a 5% chance of success. For market size, the flu market is enormous. It's actually bigger than the RSV market in population because the flu shot is often recommended for all people, whereas an RSV vaccine would be recommended for adults over 60 and children under about 8. You need to adjust this, though, because an RSV vaccine would fetch a much higher price than a flu vaccine due to lack of competition. While a maternal RSV vaccine would see over $1 billion in revenues, analysts forecast an older adults vaccine would reach over $4 billion in sales. I forecast an approved Novavax flu vaccine would reach between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in sales annually. There is existing competition in the flu market, but NVAX's vaccine would have a tremendous advantage over existing vaccines. If it's ability to let experts choose which strains to protect against just before the season starts results in higher efficacy than the egg embryo vaccines, then it will probably dominate the market. The Global Data report states, "If Novavax's pipeline candidate is approved, GlobalData expects that such a novel vaccine boasting a nanoparticle-based design approach would send shockwaves through the seasonal influenza vaccines marketplace, as it would be the first successful attempt at producing a universal influenza vaccine, with the added potential for applicability across other indications."
 Thus, besides its older adults RSV vaccine still having a good likelihood of succeeding in its next phase 3, the company has three very high revenue candidates in its pipeline. If only one succeeds, they'd most likely see sales of $1 billion to $4 billion depending on which were approved. With a price to sales ratio of 6, the company's market cap would be between $6 billion and $24 billion. If more than one succeeds, revenues would be between about $3 billion and $6 billion depending on which two are approved. The two risks for the company are that none of its many pipeline products are approved, and that the company has to do major dilution some time in the next year and a half when its cash it slated to be used up. Later in this article, I will do an initial discussion of the risk of dilution and in the future I will dedicate an entire article to the topic. On the topic of the potential of none of its products being approved, that is the case for all clinical stage biotech companies. By their very nature, there is a very large pay-off if a product is approved, and a serious loss if none are approved. Some products have very large markets and have a giant pay-off, and some have small markets with a smaller pay-off. Likewise, a company with only one product in its pipeline is a higher risk than a company with five products in its pipeline. Including its joint ventures and partnerships, Novavax has 12 products in its pipeline. Here are some other vaccines with small to mid-sized potential revenue streams. Malaria Vaccine In 2009, Novavax formed a joint venture with its partner Cadila Pharmaceuticals to use Novavax's proprietary vaccine technology to develop and manufacture vaccines for the Indian market and other overseas markets. In 2011, the two companies announced the joint venture was developing a malaria vaccine with funding from India's Department of Biotechnology Vaccine Grand Challenge Program. The program is also being supported by the Malaria Vaccine Development Program, a not-for-profit organization established to support the development of malaria vaccines. The International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) based in India, Italy and South Africa is also involved.
 Malaria is the largest killer of infants world-wide, so a vaccine for it would be a huge market. Novavax doesn't list the malaria vaccine in its pipeline because Cadila has a majority stake in the joint venture. But Novavax would benefit greatly if this vaccine succeeds. And it's not costing the company anything. Rabies Vaccine Novavax's joint venture with Cadila also has a rabies vaccine that Novavax genetically engineered. The vaccine is now in a phase 3 trial. Novavax's 2016 annual report said the vaccine "can be administered both as a pre-exposure and a post-exposure prophylactic regimen. The post-exposure regimen has the potential to use fewer doses (three doses) than the current standard of care (five doses)." The joint venture also received marketing authorization for its seasonal flu vaccine from the Indian government, which is the Indian equivalent of approval of a Biologics License Application. The company is currently manufacturing and selling the vaccine. It should be noted that this vaccine uses Novavax's previous VLP technology, which has since been improved on by its nanoparticle Matrix M technology. Combination RSV / Flu Vaccine The Global Data report notes: "Novavax is also planning to investigate a combination respiratory vaccine that merges its seasonal influenza nanoparticle vaccine with the RSV F vaccine, an approach GlobalData views as a potential game-changer for the prevention of these two infections, particularly in young children and the elderly." It added, "Ultimately, possession of a nanoparticle vaccine that protects against both RSV and influenza would immediately catapult Novavax into a leading position in the competitive landscape for both these infections." Doctors and pharmacies would far prefer to give their patients one shot instead of two. Patients of course would also prefer one shot instead of two. Infant RSV Vaccine The maternal RSV vaccine would immunize infants from birth to six months. The company is working on a vaccine for infants aged 6 months to 5 years. Therefore, this is actually a bigger market than the maternal RSV vaccine.
 Novavax has completed a successful phase 1 trial for the vaccine. Since it already has two other RSV trials in progress, it's put the infant vaccine on the back burner so it can put some time and money to non-RSV vaccines like Zika and seasonal flu. EBOLA During the last major outbreak of Ebola in 2014 and 2015 that killed 10,000 people, Novavax developed an Ebola vaccine that had a successful phase 1 trial. "I believe that we have made the best Ebola vaccine, and shown that it works," the company said. However, the outbreak subsided, so the vaccine was put on the shelf. A couple of weeks ago, Ebola re-surfaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but it's currently a small outbreak and is very much under control. The size of the Ebola market is relatively small, so this vaccine would be a minor one at best. Western countries have proven very adept at preventing the virus from entering or spreading in their countries. Wealthy countries are also committed to keeping it under control in Africa so it doesn't spread. So the market for this will probably never be large. Pandemic Flu The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) spent $97 million advancing Novavax's pandemic flu vaccine from 2011 to 2014, and then decided to spent another $70 million to advance it further in 2015 and 2016. At present while it awaits more funding to continue the development, it appears the company has put development of this on hold, given that it's not showing on its current pipeline chart. That said, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has written that "By far the most lucrative business opportunity is created by pandemic influenza" due to the number of vaccinations needed. Also, most governments in industrialized countries consider it their responsibility to prepare for flu pandemics. The article says: "Pandemic influenza preparedness efforts are largely aligned with World Health Organization's advice to national governments on societal, antiviral and vaccine strategies, based on monitoring the threat-level of emerging potential pandemic influenza viruses. Since purchasing vaccines for immunization campaigns is coordinated by national governments, they are responsible for ensuring sufficient access from the early stages of an influenza pandemic onward." The U.S. government views Novavax positively because its Matrix M vaccine technology allows for quick creation of new vaccines. They can take any pandemic molecule provided by the World Health Organization, and within weeks produce a vaccine from it. When a pandemic begins, governments need a vaccine created quickly and manufactured quickly, not the normal 4 to 6 months that egg embryos take.

Matrix M Technology On the last earnings call, Novavax announced that a number of other researchers and companies are using its proprietary Matrix M adjuvant in their products. For example, Genocea Biosciences developed a genital herpes vaccine using Novavax's Matrix M adjuvant, and their vaccine was recently awarded the World Vaccine Congress 2017 Industry Excellence award for the best therapeutic vaccine. Genocea plans to start a Phase 3 trial in the fourth quarter. Novavax said, "Our Matrix-M adjuvant is an important component of this vaccine and we are pleased to be collaborating with Genocea on the continued development of this important new vaccine product." If the vaccine is approved, Novavax will get a percentage of all sales. The company also said researchers at Oxford University are conducting a phase 2 challenge trial with a novel malaria vaccine candidate that uses Matrix-M as "a critical component." The Oxford team had already had positive results with development of its malaria vaccine, but needed something to improve it further and settled on Matrix M as the best solution. Glenn said that the Oxford team published data in the journal Nature that "showed enhancement of immunogenic and efficacy of their vaccine candidate based on the use of Matrix M. Along with Novavax's RSV vaccine development program, this data provided additional external validation of the value of Matrix-M as an adjuvant for improving the outcomes during the development of a wide arrays of vaccines." If the vaccine succeeds in the huge malaria market, Novavax will also benefit. "This growing value of development in clinical experience is validating Matrix-M within the industry and opening up opportunities for future collaborations and value creations … use of Matrix-M is expanding significantly, as it's becoming an increasingly valuable part of our portfolio," said Erck. You can read more about Matrix M here. Conclusion In case you lost count, here's the total:
  4 vaccine candidates that would have sales over $1 billion: Zika, older adults RSV, maternal RSV and seasonal flu 3 other vaccine candidates: Ebola, Combination Respiratory and Infant RSV. Infant RSV would potentially also have over $1 billion in sales. However, this market is one in which it's likely to face competition. In comparison, no other company is working on a maternal product that would protect babies in the months before they're able to get an RSV shot. Its pandemic flu vaccine that is on hold pending additional governmental funding 3 vaccines via its joint venture in India: malaria, rabies and seasonal flu Several vaccines by third-party partners including genital herpes and malaria  How's that for "no back-ups"? Despite there being over 12 products, this Economic Calendar headline claims "Novavax's (NASDAQ:NVAX) Future Hinges on the Success of its Zika Vaccine." Somehow, the Motley Fool puts forth a completely different, but incorrect claim: "Everything pretty much comes down to the PREPARE trial at this point. If PREPARE misses the mark like the RESOLVE study, Novavax's hopes and dreams will effectively be dashed." Yes the PREPARE trial is an important one, but the company's hopes won't be dashed if it fails. As this article has extensively detailed, Novavax has many other arrows in its quiver. That brings us to the next major area of incorrect information: future funding. There is so much false information being put forth on this front that a full article is needed to set it straight. But in sum, one major falsehood is the claim that the company's only option for funding is a heavy amount of dilution. For starters, it has at least three other sources of funding: A) Partner with a larger company that pays for the trials in exchange for a cut of future profits. This is fairly common for start-up biotechs to do. B) Government funding; and C) Foundation funding. Also, it has enough cash to last until the middle of 2018, so there's almost no chance it will do a secondary offering until after the results of the older adults RSV trial, the maternal RSV trial, the seasonal flu trial and the Zika trial come in, so it has four opportunities for good news to propel the stock higher before doing a secondary. If the stock price is high, then they're more likely to raise money through a secondary. But the impact would be fairly small if the stock price is high.
 If the stock price doesn't go high, then it will probably do A above. In either case, it will pursue both B and C above, which will reduce the amount of A needed or the size of a secondary. Another option is selling the company to a well-heeled company that needs to bolster its pipeline. For the large pipeline above, it would sell for a sizable premium over the current share price. I think this option is the least likely and will probably only be pursued as a back-up to the others. In the next articles, I will examine future funding in depth, and also rebut misinformation about other aspects of the company. The benefit of the misinformation is that it has created a strong buying opportunity for investors. As the correct information is learned and as positive catalysts from trials come in, there is a high probability that the stock will increase greatly in price in the coming weeks and months.

Novavax stock surges 6% after release of full mid-stage vaccine trial results
Novavax Inc.  shares rose as much as 6% in premarket trade Wednesday after the company published full results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its RSV F vaccine in the medical journal Vaccine. The vaccine is intended to protect babies from severe lower respiratory tract infections through maternal vaccination. Novavax shares closed at $1.02 on Tuesday. Early results from the trial had previously been released in spring 2014, showing a positive safety profile for the vaccine. According to the full results, those with the vaccine had an about 52% reduction in recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection -- which commonly causes lower respiratory tract infections -- relative to the placebo arms, the company said. "While it was not the primary endpoint in the trial, the Western Blot data suggest the potential to protect both the pregnant mothers and their infants from RSV disease," said President, Research and Development Dr. Gregory Glenn, referring to a type of research analysis. The phase 3 trial enrolled 720 women between 18 and 35 years of age. Novavax shares have dropped 28.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

Novavax stock surges 6% after release of full mid-stage vaccine trial results
Novavax Inc.  shares rose as much as 6% in premarket trade Wednesday after the company published full results from a mid-stage clinical trial for its RSV F vaccine in the medical journal Vaccine. The vaccine is intended to protect babies from severe lower respiratory tract infections through maternal vaccination. Novavax shares closed at $1.02 on Tuesday. Early results from the trial had previously been released in spring 2014, showing a positive safety profile for the vaccine. According to the full results, those with the vaccine had an about 52% reduction in recent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection -- which commonly causes lower respiratory tract infections -- relative to the placebo arms, the company said. "While it was not the primary endpoint in the trial, the Western Blot data suggest the potential to protect both the pregnant mothers and their infants from RSV disease," said President, Research and Development Dr. Gregory Glenn, referring to a type of research analysis. The phase 3 trial enrolled 720 women between 18 and 35 years of age. Novavax shares have dropped 28.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
