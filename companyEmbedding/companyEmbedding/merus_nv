Technology - MERUS








































































Technology


The product programs in the Merus pipeline are based on the Biclonics® format.

Biclonics® are bispecific, full length human IgG antibodies. With its proprietary technologies, Merus is able to rapidly generate lead product candidate Biclonics® with the potential to produce tumor cell-killing activity with the same, or potentially better, functionality as combinations of conventional monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, because Biclonics® are based on the robust and proven IgG format they are manufactured using industry standard processes yielding the predictable in vivo behavior associated with conventional therapeutic antibodies such as long half-life and low immunogenicity. Biclonics®: unprecedented antibody functionality in a reliable and manufacturable format.


A suite of technologies
Merus exploits a suite of technologies integrating the generation of large panels of high quality human antibodies and their rapid conversion into thousands of Biclonics® ready for functional screening in clinically relevant assays.


Human antibody generation. Merus uses its proprietary transgenic mouse MeMo® and state-of-the art phage display libraries of human Fab fragments for the generation of panels of common light chain monoclonal antibodies. Large and diverse panels of high affinity antibodies have been generated against a broad variety of targets.
Biclonics® format. Merus has successfully modified the CH3 constant region of the IgG antibody isotype to efficiently drive heterodimerisation and production of stable Biclonics® by eukaryotic cells. The Biclonics® format retains several of the favourable attributes of the standard human therapeutic IgG antibody format including stability, long half-life and low immunogenicity.
Biclonics® high-throughput functional screening. The panels of target-specific human antibodies are combined with the modified constant regions and introduced as pairs of DNA constructs into eukaryotic cells. The common light chain format and engineered CH3 domains ensure the secretion of pure functional Biclonics® into the cell culture medium. The medium of thousands of cell cultures is harvested and used in cell and tissue-based functional assays.

The Merus technology platform allows for functional evaluation of Biclonics® in the relevant therapeutic format leading to the discovery of therapeutic candidates with differentiated properties.

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Merus N.V. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Merus B.V. is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing bispecific antibody therapeutics, referred to as Biclonics. The company's bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-128, is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial as a potential treatment for HER2-expressing solid tumors; MCLA-117, is being developed as a potential treatment for acute myeloid leukemia and MCLA-158, which is designed to bind to cancer stem cells and is being developed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer and other solid tumors. Merus B.V. is headquartered in Utrecht, the Netherlands.   " (7/15/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Lead mAbs '128 and '117 remain early; initial data this year (likely ASCO/ASH) could provide some signals though may be early to definitively interpret. We continue to see promise though, and particularly striking from our mtgs was the potential de-risking advantages their bispecific format and capabilities will provide as the pipeline matures'something we view as underappreciated. Raise tgt to $33 to better reflect LT potential." (2/17/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $31.33 (86.40% upside)

Merus N.V. Signs Commercial Multi-Product License For ProBioGen's GlymaxX® ADCC Enhancement Technology






GlobeNewswire



Jun 1, 2016 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































 BERLIN & UTRECHT, The Netherlands, June 01, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProBioGen AG and Merus N.V. (Nasdaq:MRUS) today jointly announced that Merus has signed a commercial multi-product license agreement for ProBioGen's GlymaxX   ®   ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity) enhancement technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Merus has obtained non-exclusive use of GlymaxX   ®   technology for Merus' Biclonics ® pipeline of bispecific cancer antibodies to enhance their ADCC activity. Financial details of the license agreement were not disclosed. MCLA-158 is the first GlymaxX ®-modified ADCC-enhanced bispecific antibody being developed under this commercial license. MCLA-158 is being developed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer and other types of solid tumors. The compound is designed to bind to cancer stem cells that express EGFRs (epidermal growth factor receptors) and Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5). Merus had previously utilized the GlymaxX  ®  Technology for its lead candidate, MCLA-128, which is designed to bind to HER2 and HER3-expressing solid tumors. Merus reported interim clinical data from an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial for MCLA-128 in April 2016. These data included a favorable safety profile and early signs of anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. "We are pleased that Merus is again collaborating with ProBioGen for development of their promising antibody cancer therapy, MCLA-158," said Dr. Wieland Wolf, CEO of ProBioGen. "Merus' Biclonics  ®  platform represents an encouraging approach to the killing of cancer cells, and we believe that Biclonics  ®  utilizing our enhanced ADCC technology hold great promise in potentially transforming the cancer treatment paradigm."   "ProBioGen's GlymaxX  ®  technology is proven to increase an antibody's ability to bind to cellular targets, resulting in greater cell-killing proficiency," said Ton Logtenberg, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Merus. "We are eager to advance development of MCLA-158 utilizing this exciting technology, and we plan to file an IND with the FDA by the end of next year. At the same time, we are continuing to advance our other GlymaxX  ® -enabled candidate, MCLA-128 for HER-expressing solid tumors, and we expect to report topline results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in the second half of 2017."    ProBioGen's GlymaxX  ®  technology is based on the heterologous, cytosolic expression of a bacterial enzyme that redirects the de-novo fucose synthesis pathway towards a sugar-nucleotide that cannot be metabolized by the cell. The enzyme mediates the secretion of antibodies with minimized fucose content. The resulting modification of the glycostructure of IgG1 antibodies enhances their binding to natural killer, or NK, cells and thus the ADCC response in potency assays. Consequently, the potency of the modified antibodies, directed against tumor or infected cells, is substantially increased.  About ADCC ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity) activity is an important antibody function, leading to the selective killing of target cells, i.e. cancerous cells or pathogen-infected cells. Several therapeutic antibody drugs on the market rely on ADCC as a mechanism of action. ADCC enhancement has the potential to increase the therapeutic effect and/or to greatly reduce antibody dosage requirements, resulting in fewer side-effects and treatment costs.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$47.3 million (or approximately $55.0 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full), at the initial public offering
price per share of $10.00, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses of the offering that are payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $17.0 million to advance clinical development of MCLA-128 for
  the treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors, which we expect will be     
  sufficient to complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we initiated in   
  February 2015;                                                             

• approximately $14.0 million to advance clinical development of MCLA-117 for
  the treatment of AML, which we expect will be sufficient to complete our   
  Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we initiated in May 2016;                    

• approximately $10.0 million to advance development of MCLA-158 for the 
  treatment of colorectal cancer, which we expect will be sufficient to complete
  pre-clinical development and submit an IND application to the FDA to initiate
  a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States; and           

• the remainder to fund our other current and future research and development
  activities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.   

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the costs necessary to develop bispecific antibody candidates can be difficult.
The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our bispecific antibody candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As
a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through at least the next 24 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit.


We compete directly with companies that focus on immuno-oncology and companies
dedicating their resources to novel forms of cancer therapies. We also face
competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and other
various public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new
drugs and therapies into oncology, we expect to face increasingly intense
competition as new technologies become available. Any bispecific antibody
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with
existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers
and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries
may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of
our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic
bispecific antibody candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy,
safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in
guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and
the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less
expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe
effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain
FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we
may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing
a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if our
bispecific antibody candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at
a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by
then.

In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products
in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer, including other bispecific
antibodies or similar molecules. Our closest competitors in this area include
Affimed N.V., OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Genmab A/S, MacroGenics, Inc.,
Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Xencor,
Inc. These bispecific antibody candidates in development may provide efficacy,
safety, dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently
marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for
any of our bispecific antibody candidates for which we obtain marketing
approval.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative bispecific
antibody therapeutics. Our pipeline of full-length human bispecific antibody
candidates, which we refer to as Biclonics, are generated from our technology
platform. By binding to two different antigens, or targets,


 Biclonics can be
designed to simultaneously block receptors that drive tumor cell growth and
survival and to mobilize the patient’s immune response by activating various
killer cells to eradicate tumors. In our pre-clinical studies, our bispecific
antibody candidates were effective in killing tumor cells, a result that we
believe supports their potential efficacy in the treatment of cancer. In
February 2015, we commenced a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our lead bispecific
antibody candidate, MCLA-128, for the treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors,
and we expect to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of
2017. In May 2016, we commenced a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our second
bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-117, for the treatment of acute myeloid
leukemia, or AML. We are also developing MCLA-158, a bispecific antibody
candidate that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing leucine-rich
repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5, or Lgr5, and epidermal growth
factor receptors, or EGFR, for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer, and
plan to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA, by the end of 2017 to initiate a Phase 1/2
clinical trial in the United States. Additionally, we have several other
bispecific antibody candidates in pre-clinical development that bind to
combinations of immunomodulatory molecules, including programmed death
receptor-1, or PD-1, and programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, both of which we
believe play a significant role in treating cancer.

Our Biclonics technology platform enables rapid functional screening of large
collections of Biclonics which allows us to identify lead candidates with
multiple mechanisms of action. The Biclonics format retains the Immunoglobulin
G, or IgG, format of conventional monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, and is
designed to preserve the format’s key features, including stability, long
half-life and low immunogenicity, when developing our bispecific antibody
candidates. We leverage industry-standard manufacturing processes and
infrastructure to efficiently produce Biclonics.

Our lead bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-128, is currently in a Phase 1/2
clinical trial in Europe for the treatment of various solid tumors, including
breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers. We believe MCLA-128 has the potential to
be a more effective treatment of HER2-expressing solid tumors than existing
therapies due to its ability to inhibit cellular growth factor receptors on
tumor cells and simultaneously involve immune system cells to attack tumor
cells. MCLA-128 is designed to bind to and block growth factor receptors known
as HER2 and HER3, as well as recruit immune killer cells, such as natural
killer, or NK, cells and macrophages. In our pre-clinical studies, MCLA-128 was
more effective in inhibiting heregulin-driven tumor growth than HER2 or HER3
mAbs, as well as their combinations and a combination of currently approved HER2
mAbs. The production of heregulin, which is the binding molecule, or ligand, for
HER3, has been widely shown to cause cancer cells to grow and become resistant
to treatment with HER2-targeted therapies. Our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of
MCLA-128 will assess its safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity. In the
dose escalation phase of the trial, we observed an objective positive effect in
12 out of the 27 patients, or 44%, treated and evaluable for efficacy. In 11 of
those 12 patients, the disease had not progressed at the completion of the first
two cycles of treatment, a condition defined as stable disease. In one patient,
we observed significant reductions in tumor size and disappearance of some
metastatic lesions with no new tumors appearing through the beginning of the
thirteenth cycle of treatment, a condition defined as a partial response. This
partial response has been confirmed at later evaluation dates and this patient
continues to receive MCLA-128 after more than 10 months in the trial. The
disease progressed in the remaining patients evaluable for a response. Three of
the 11 patients initially assessed with stable disease continued without
progression of the disease beyond the fourth cycle of their treatment. In the
remaining eight patients initially assessed with stable disease, the disease
progressed at a later evaluation date. We expect to report top-line results from
the Phase 1/2 trial in the second half of 2017.

Our second bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-117, is currently in a Phase 1/2
clinical trial in Europe for the treatment of AML. AML generally has a poor
prognosis and limited progress has been made in disease outcomes despite a
growing AML patient population. Clinical and pre-clinical studies suggest that
treatment-resistent leukemic stem cells are a potential cause of disease
relapse. MCLA-117 binds to CD3, a cell-surface molecule present on all T-cells,
and to CLEC12A, a cell surface molecule present on approximately 90 to 95% of
AML tumor cells and stem cells in newly diagnosed and relapsed patients.
MCLA-117 is designed to recruit and activate T-cells to kill AML tumor cells and
stem cells. In our pre-clinical studies, MCLA-117 killed tumor cells in blood
samples of AML patients. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for MCLA-117
for the treatment of AML from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.
We expect to report top-line results from the Phase 1/2 trial in the first half
of 2018. We are also currently evaluating MCLA-117 for the treatment of
myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, in pre-clinical studies.

In addition to MCLA-128 and MCLA-117, we are developing MCLA-158, a bispecific
antibody candidate that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing Lgr5
and EGFR, for the potential treatment of colorectal cancer. We are conducting
pre-clinical studies of MCLA-158 and plan to submit an IND to the FDA by the end
of 2017 to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the United States. MCLA-158 is
designed to kill cancer stem cells using two different mechanisms of action. The
first mechanism of action involves blocking growth and survival pathways in
tumor stem cells. The second mechanism of action involves the recruitment and
enhancement of immune effector cells.

 Merus N.V. Signs Commercial Multi-Product License for ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® ADCC Enhancement TechnologySidebarPress Releases Overview01 June 2016Merus N.V. Signs Commercial Multi-Product License for ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® ADCC Enhancement TechnologyBispecific Cancer Antibody Pipeline Optimized by GlymaxX® Manufacturing TechnologyBerlin, Germany, & Utrecht, The Netherlands, June 1, 2016: ProBioGen AG and Merus N.V. today jointly announced that Merus has signed a commercial multi-product license agreement for ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity) enhancement technology. Under the terms of the agreement, Merus has obtained non-exclusive use of GlymaxX® technology for Merus’ Biclonics® pipeline of bispecific cancer antibodies to enhance their ADCC activity. Financial details of the license agreement were not disclosed.MCLA-158 is the first GlymaxX®-modified ADCC-enhanced bispecific antibody being developed under this commercial license. MCLA-158 is being developed as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer and other types of solid tumors. The compound is designed to bind to cancer stem cells that express EGFRs (epidermal growth factor receptors) and Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5). Merus had previously utilized the GlymaxX® Technology for its lead candidate, MCLA-128, which is designed to bind to HER2 and HER3-expressing solid tumors. Merus reported interim clinical data from an ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial for MCLA-128 in April 2016. These data included a favorable safety profile and early signs of anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.“We are pleased that Merus is again collaborating with ProBioGen for development of their promising antibody cancer therapy, MCLA-158,” said Dr. Wieland Wolf, CEO of ProBioGen. “Merus’ Biclonics® platform represents an encouraging approach to the killing of cancer cells, and we believe that Biclonics® utilizing our enhanced ADCC technology hold great promise in potentially transforming the cancer treatment paradigm.”“ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® technology is proven to increase an antibody’s ability to bind to cellular targets, resulting in greater cell-killing proficiency,” said Ton Logtenberg, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “We are eager to advance development of MCLA-158 utilizing this exciting technology, and we plan to file an IND with the FDA by the end of next year. At the same time, we are continuing to advance our other GlymaxX®-enabled candidate, MCLA-128 for HER-expressing solid tumors, and we expect to report topline results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in the second half of 2017.”ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® technology is based on the heterologous, cytosolic expression of a bacterial enzyme that redirects the de-novo fucose synthesis pathway towards a sugar-nucleotide that cannot be metabolized by the cell. The enzyme mediates the secretion of antibodies with minimized fucose content. The resulting modification of the glycostructure of IgG1 antibodies enhances their binding to natural killer, or NK, cells and thus the ADCC response in potency assays. Consequently, the potency of the modified antibodies, directed against tumor or infected cells, is substantially increased.###About ADCCADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity) activity is an important antibody function, leading to the selective killing of target cells, i.e. cancerous cells or pathogen-infected cells. Several therapeutic antibody drugs on the market rely on ADCC as a mechanism of action. ADCC enhancement has the potential to increase the therapeutic effect and/or to greatly reduce antibody dosage requirements, resulting in fewer side-effects and treatment costs.About GlymaxX® www.glymaxx.deThe GlymaxX® technology, developed by ProBioGen, prevents the synthesis of the sugar “fucose” and hence, in antibody-producing cells, its addition to the N-linked carbohydrate part of the antibody. The absence of fucose is known to greatly enhance ADCC. The GlymaxX® technology is based on the stable introduction of a gene for an enzyme which literally eliminates the producer cells’ fucose biosynthesis pathway. As a unique feature, differentiating it from other approaches, GlymaxX® can be applied to both novel and already existing antibody producer cell lines and entire antibody expression and discovery platforms, without negatively affecting their productivity or product characteristics. Moreover, it is simple, rapid, potent, and universally applicable to different Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, hosts and all other eukaryotic cell species. GlymaxX® can be rapidly applied in a few weeks to any existing antibody producer cell line, can be used in the context of ProBioGen’s pre-engineered GlymaxX® host cells, or can be introduced into entire animal cell expression platforms by modifying the host cell line. ProBioGen offers its GlymaxX® technology royalty-free as a service or as an individual license.About ProBioGen AG www.probiogen.deProBioGen is a specialist for the development and manufacturing of complex therapeutic glyco-proteins. Combining both state-of-the-art development platforms together with intelligent product-specific technologies yields biologics with optimized properties.Rapid and integrated cell line and process development, comprehensive analytical development and following reliable GMP manufacturing is performed by a highly skilled and experienced team. All services and technologies are embedded in a total quality management system to assure compliance with international ISO and GMP standards (EMA/FDA).ProBioGen is operational since more than 20 years and is located in Berlin, Germany.About Merus N.V. www.merus.nlMerus is a fully-integrated biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that combine the benefits of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to simultaneously bind to multiple targets. Merus has two lead programs in development: MCLA-128 for the treatment of solid tumors and MCLA-117 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Merus is also developing a broad pipeline of preclinical programs. Merus’ technologies encompass the proprietary MeMo® transgenic mouse for the production of common light-chain human antibodies and the CH3 heterodimerization technology for the production of full-length IgG Biclonics®. These Biclonics® are robustly produced from a single clonal manufacturing cell line, using industry-standard systems. Merus’ Biclonics® are designed to bind to multiple disease-associated targets, thereby eliminating tumor cells more efficiently and preventing tumor cells from escaping treatment. In Merus’ Biclonics®-ENGAGE approach used in the MCLA-117 program, bispecific antibodies are used to induce the cytotoxic activity of T-cells to kill cancer cells.This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding the impact our Biclonics® platform can have on cancer, MCLA-158’s potential to treat colorectal cancer and other types of solid tumors, the potential benefits ProBioGen’s GlymaxX® technology may have on our Biclonics® pipeline, the timing of FDA filings and the timing and anticipated results from our clinical trials.These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: we have incurred significant losses, are not currently profitable and may never become profitable; our need for additional funding, which may not be available and which may require us to restrict out operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or bispecific antibody candidates; potential delays in regulatory approval, which would impact the ability to commercialize our product candidates and affect our ability to generate revenue; the unproven approach to therapeutic intervention of our Biclonics® technology; potential difficulties in validating and developing companion diagnostics, which could harm our development strategy; our limited operating history; economic, political, regulatory and other risks involved with international operations; exchange rate fluctuations or abandonment of the euro currency; the lengthy and expensive process of clinical drug development, which has an uncertain outcome; the unpredictable nature of our early stage development efforts for marketable drugs; potential adverse public reaction to the use of cancer immunotherapies; potential delays in enrollment of patients, which could affect the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals; our potential exposure to costly and damaging liability claims; post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market; failure to obtain marketing approval internationally; compliance with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations; anti-kickback, fraud, abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations exposing us to potential criminal sanctions; recently enacted or future legislation; failure to compete successfully against other drug companies; potential competition from other drug companies if we fail to obtain orphan drug designation or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our products; the possibility that governmental authorities and health insurers may not establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies to support our products; the potential failure of our product candidates to be accepted on the market by the medical community; our lack of experience selling, marketing and distributing products and our lack of internal capability to do so; potential competition from biosimilars; our reliance on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and the potential for those third parties to not perform satisfactorily; our reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, which may delay, prevent or impair our development and commercialization efforts; protection of our proprietary technology; our patents being found invalid or unenforceable; potential lawsuits for infringement of third-party intellectual property; adequate protection of our trademarks; our potential failure to obtain extensions of the terms of patents covering our products; potential difficulties protecting our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions; changes in United States patent law; protection of the confidentiality of our trade secrets; claims asserting that we or our employees misappropriated a third-party’s intellectual property or otherwise claiming ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property; compliance with patent regulations; potential system failures; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; managing our growth could result in difficulties; the price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially; certain of our shareholders and members of our management board own a majority of our outstanding shares and exercise significant control over us; a significant portion of our total outstanding shares are eligible to be sold into the market; provisions of our Articles of Association or Dutch corporate law might deter favorable acquisition bids for us or prevent a beneficial change of control; we may lose our foreign private issuer status and incur significant expenses as a result; and unfavorable or lacking analyst research or reports might cause the price of our common shares to decline.These and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on May 20, 2016 relating to our Registration Statement on Form F-1, and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change.
