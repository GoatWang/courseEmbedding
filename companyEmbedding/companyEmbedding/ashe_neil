for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  He was
appointed in January 2012 to lead Walmart’s Global eCommerce Division, which
develops strategies, platforms and applications that combine the latest in
online innovations with physical stores to give Walmart’s customers a unique
and seamless shopping experience. In January 2016, Neil was appointed to also
lead Walmart Technology, Walmart’s global technology division, aligning Walmart’s

across online, mobile and stores.

Walmart.com to Launch Subscription-Sampling Program
Goodies Will Offer a Birchbox Approach to Artisanal Food Products


	By  

Jack Neff.
	

	
	
 Published on June 01, 2012. 








Walmart.com's march to catch Amazon in e-commerce and integrate online and offline offerings is   entering some new fronts and generating sometimes surprising results as the company prepares to launch the latest in a spate of   new initiatives -- Goodies, a subscription mail-order-sampling program.





Goodies, set to roll out within about a month, will initially focus on artisan and other food products but could expand to other product categories, said Neil Ashe, CEO of   global e-commerce for Walmart, in a press briefing in Rogers, Ark. The briefing was part of   the retailer's "Shareholders Week" events prior to Friday's annual shareholder meeting.








The monthly subscription price has yet to be determined, he said, adding, "think of   it as cheap." Initially, Walmart.com will choose the products to include in the box, then monitor how popular they are based on reorder activity. Mr. Ashe likened Goodies to the Birchbox program for cosmetics, and if it gains traction, he said marketers may be willing to pay to include their products.



Mr. Ashe, who took the top Walmart e-commerce job in January after running CBS Interactive, noted that   he didn't have much retail experience coming in, but joked that   he had worked in his father's small retail store in Knoxville, Tenn., when he was growing up. And in one of   his first public appearances since taking the high-profile e-commerce role, Mr. Ashe laid out his vision for Walmart, which includes making considerable use of   having the world's biggest combination of   online and offline retail assets.



One way Walmart.com is   doing that   is   by   applying the social analytics developed by   its @WalmartLabs e-commerce and mobile R&D unit. Mr. Ashe said that   includes mining every tweet it can find from the brand's 16 million-plus   Facebook fans. That analysis earlier this year helped identify a cake-pop maker as a popular item among shoppers.



"We were able to get those into stores immediately, and they were big sellers as a result," Mr. Ashe said. "We probably never would have found that   product without the Twitter feed."



"In many ways, the ethos of   Walmart and ethos of   the internet are exactly the same," Mr. Ashe said, including the focus on the lowest possible price. "When I looked at the company from the outside, I couldn't think of   a company that   was better positioned to be successful in the transition to the internet or e-commerce than Walmart."



Walmart is   seeing strong results from the most recent upgrade of   its iPhone app, including an in-store GPS feature that   lets people find products in stores. App downloads have tripled since the latest upgrade, and 10% to 20% of   users are using the in-store GPS feature, said Gibu Thomas, senior VP-mobile and digital of   Walmart. Only available on the iPhone now, the GPS feature should be available on Android and other devices within weeks, Mr. Thomas said.



"There's probably no way to overstate the importance of   mobile over the next 10 years in e-commerce," Mr. Ashe said. "And we intend to play to win in mobile." But much of   that   victory will come from efforts that   tie mobile to the store, such as in-store GPS.



A recently launched "pay with cash" program, Mr. Ashe said, is   opening Walmart.com to "a whole segment of   the population that  's being ignored for no apparent reason."



The product is   still shipped to homes, though customers pay with cash at Walmart stores.



"One of   the more interesting things about this that   we didn't expect is   that   only 60% of   the people actually pay with cash," Mr. Ashe said. The other 40% are simply people uncomfortable giving their credit-card numbers out over the internet.



So the customer base drawn by   the program is   a combination of   the "unbanked" without credit cards or checking accounts and those afraid of   identity theft, said Joel Anderson, president of   Walmart.com U.S.



Walmart.com actually identified the need for the program, he said, when it tested Walmart.com stores in strip centers in California last year and discovered many people were buying MoneyPak or other cash cards in stores and then using the computers in the stores to order products to ship home, Mr. Anderson said.



"What hasn't moved online yet are the true grocery and consumables categories," Mr. Ashe said, adding, "it may never get all the way there." But he said the Walmart-To-Go home-delivery service the company is   testing may be a way to help that   happen.

June 20, 2016 12:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BENTONVILLE, Ark. & BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and JD.com (Nasdaq:JD), China’s largest e-commerce 
      company by revenue, today announced that they have formed a strategic 
      alliance to better serve consumers across China through a powerful 
      combination of e-commerce and retail.
    


      The agreement between the companies includes a wide range of business 
      initiatives, covering both online and offline retail. For Walmart, the 
      alliance greatly expands its opportunity in China e-commerce and 
      provides its stores and Sam’s Clubs with potential traffic from JD.com’s 
      significant base of online customers and vast same-day delivery network 
      to serve its customers. JD.com will leverage Yihaodian’s strong brand 
      and business in eastern and southern China and in key product categories 
      such as high-quality grocery and household goods, both of which 
      complement its own geographical and product strengths. In addition, 
      JD.com’s customers will gain access to a wide range of new and imported 
      items from Walmart and Sam’s Club.
    

      As part of the agreement, Walmart will receive 144,952,250 newly issued 
      JD.com Class A ordinary shares, amounting to approximately 5 percent of 
      total shares outstanding and the companies will partner in several 
      strategic areas, including:
    


        JD.com will take ownership of the Yihaodian marketplace platform 
        assets, including the Yihaodian brand, website and app. Walmart will 
        continue to operate the Yihaodian direct sales business and will be a 
        seller on the Yihaodian marketplace, leveraging its global supply 
        chain to provide customers a wide range of products. JD.com and 
        Walmart will work together on growing the Yihaodian brand and business 
        under its current name and market position.
      

        Sam’s Club China, which has proven tremendously successful within the 
        markets it operates in China, will open a flagship store on JD.com, 
        vastly expanding the availability of Sam’s Club’s high-quality 
        imported products across China. It will offer same- and next-day 
        delivery through JD.com’s nationwide warehousing and delivery network, 
        which covers a population of 600 million consumers.
      

        Walmart and JD.com will work together to leverage their supply chains 
        to increase the product selection for customers across China, 
        including broadening the range of imported products.
      

        Walmart’s China stores will be listed as a preferred retailer on 
        JD.com’s O2O JV Dada, China’s largest crowd-sourced delivery platform, 
        driving online traffic to Walmart stores and allowing customers to 
        order fresh food and other items from Walmart stores for 2-hour home 
        delivery, while significantly broadening the product selection 
        available to Dada’s customers. Walmart will continue to operate its 
        own physical stores.
      


      “We’re excited about teaming up with such a strong leader in JD.com, and 
      the potential that this new relationship creates for customers in China, 
      as well as for our businesses. We thank the Yihaodian associates for 
      creating a strong brand and business that has helped lead to this 
      opportunity with JD.com,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of 
      Walmart. “JD.com shares similar values in making the lives of customers 
      better. It also has a very complementary business and is an ideal 
      partner that will help us offer compelling new experiences that can 
      reach significantly more customers. We also look forward to offering 
      customers a tremendous number of quality imported products not 
      previously widely available in China through Walmart and Sam’s Club.”
    

      “We are very happy to announce this landmark agreement between two 
      leading retailers, which we are confident will help bring e-commerce in 
      China to the next level and benefit millions of consumers,” said Richard 
      Liu, CEO of JD.com. “Walmart is synonymous with trusted-quality 
      efficient retailing, and we believe that this tie up will increase both 
      product selection and overall user experience. We look forward to 
      further developing Yihaodian, which has tremendous strength in important 
      regions of eastern and southern China. Yihaodian will continue offering 
      the outstanding user experience its customers have come to expect, which 
      we will further augment by leveraging our unparalleled logistics 
      capabilities and breadth of product categories.
    

      “We are also delighted to welcome the Sam’s Club flagship store onto the 
      JD.com platform. Sam’s Club’s unique, high-end product selection meets 
      the demand from China’s increasing affluent consumers for high-quality, 
      imported products and has already proven popular in the Chinese cities 
      where it has stores. JD.com’s reputation for authentic products and 
      superior customer experience make it an outstanding home for these 
      iconic businesses to reach hundreds of millions more customers in China.”
    

      Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as Walmart’s financial advisor and 
      Morrison & Foerster LLP acted as Walmart’s legal advisor on this 
      transaction. Orrick Herrington Sutcliffe LLP and Han Kun Law Offices 
      acted as JD.com’s legal advisors on the transaction.

Former CBS Interactive Head Neil Ashe to Lead Wal-Mart’s Global Online Commerce  Biz


January 16, 2012 at 2:45 pm PT

Tweet

Neil Ashe, who left his job running CBS Interactive in late 2010, has taken a job helming Wal-Mart Stores’ global online commerce unit.
The retail behemoth said that Ashe will become president and CEO of its Global eCommerce division, replacing the retiring Eduardo Castro-Wright. He will operate out of Wal-Mart’s Silicon Valley office in San Bruno, Calif., but will likely make a lot of trips to the company’s HQ in Bentonville, Ark. (Ashe does not have the U.S.-based e-commerce business; Walmart.com is run by Joel Anderson, who reports up through the Wal-Mart U.S. stores business.)
In an interview earlier today, Ashe said that he was “impressed by the company’s realization that the consumer is changing … and the commitment to global e-commerce.”
Noting that Wal-Mart stores see 200 million customers a week, he said the goal was to make the online experience as compelling as the offline one.
“There has to be almost an indifference between physical stores and e-commerce,” said Ashe. “The whole company committed to winning on the Internet.”
Since he left CBS, Ashe has been advising a variety of Web start-ups, including LivingSocial. Ashe joined the board of the Washington, D.C.-based social buying company last spring.
The job at Wal-Mart is a big one, especially given its up-and-down history in the online space. That includes the recent decision to stop selling MP3s from its Web site.
It has also stepped up its efforts, including a number of small acquisitions, such as mobile advertising start-up OneRiot and mobile app company Small Society.
But it did pay big bucks — reportedly $300 million — for social media platform Kosmix. 
Ashe noted that Wal-Mart is indeed still dwarfed online by online dominator Amazon. “They are very innovative and strategically adept,” he said.
With 59 million monthly visitors to its U.S. Web site and an aim to go global, how Ashe navigates Wal-Mart’s path in the next years will be interesting to watch.
Here’s the official press release:
Walmart Selects Neil Ashe to Lead Global eCommerce
San Bruno, Calif., Jan. 16, 2012 — Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) today announced that Neil Ashe, 44, is the new president and CEO of the company’s Global eCommerce business, beginning today. Ashe was most recently president of CBS Interactive, where he led all online properties and also drove development of new ways to distribute programming produced by the media giant and its subsidiaries. Websites included CBS.com, CNET.com, CBSNews.com, and CBSSports.com, among others.
Ashe is replacing Eduardo Castro-Wright who announced his pending retirement in September and will assist in the transition.
“E-commerce is a great opportunity for us and we have a long-term vision to win,” said Mike Duke, Walmart’s president and CEO. “We are on track to create the next generation of E-commerce, combining the latest in online innovations with physical stores to give our customers a unique and seamless shopping experience.” 
“We have an understanding of what these customers want, a trusted brand, 200 million weekly shoppers, more than 10,000 stores around the world, and the ability to make significant investments in talent and technology. We also have successful online businesses, including in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Brazil. With all of this, it is clear that Walmart is the best- positioned retailer to deliver this multi-channel experience to consumers, many of whom are already connected to the world through smart phones and social media.”
Duke continued, “With his strong personal leadership skills, financial background and experience in successfully working within a major corporation to lead its Internet division, Neil is the ideal leader to help us build this business. He has led companies through all stages of growth and maturity. He also has a deep understanding of the interactive space and how to attract and convert online customers. Perhaps most importantly, much of Neil’s professional success has come through close collaboration and shared goals with his peers — a key attribute as we continue to integrate our online businesses across the company and with our physical stores.”
“Walmart is a special company,” said Ashe. “Growing up in East Tennessee, I have seen first-hand the difference it can make in the lives of its customers. E-commerce gives us a huge opportunity to expand and bring savings to many more people around the world. We have great things ahead of us and I am eager to get started and join the talented team already in place.”
As president of CBS Interactive, based in San Francisco, Ashe led the interactive content business with operations in the U.S., Europe and China. After leading the successful integration of CNET Networks with CBS, he and his team leveraged existing company assets to ramp up CBS entertainment content distribution online, including making CBS.com the largest television network site in the industry. 
Prior to this, Ashe was CEO of CNET Networks, initially best known for providing technology-related information, product reviews and price comparisons through CNET.com. He also oversaw dramatic development in the company’s China division, taking it from a small magazine and events operator to a highly profitable, fast-growing online business. During his tenure, the company’s value increased from $100 million to $1.8 billion. Ultimately, Ashe led the sale of the company to CBS and became president of CBS Interactive at that time.
Earlier, Ashe founded a company focused on using the Internet to improve K-12 education in the U.S. Prior to this, he was a partner and managing director at private investment firm Crest Communications Holdings and, before that, was an associate at Smith Barney, the investment bank now part of Citigroup. 
Ashe has an M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School and a B.S. in Business Administration, with a major in Finance, from Georgetown University. He serves on the boards of LivingSocial, AMC Networks and the Georgetown University Board of Regents.
Over the past year, Walmart has made investments in capabilities and talent as it continues to build Global eCommerce. It has also further strengthened its position through the acquisition of small Internet specialty companies and continues to expand in new markets such as China and Brazil, including a minority stake in Chinese Internet retailer Yihaodian.

Will it be enough?
Illustration by Owen Gildersleeve
By Farhad Manjoolong ReadJeremy King was ignoring the largest retailer in the world. For a month, he’d been getting calls from a Walmart recruiter. King was used to being wooed, since he was well known in Silicon Valley as an engineer who built key parts of eBay’s infrastructure. The calls kept coming. Finally, he picked up the phone and let Walmart know exactly what it would take to get him to interview. “I was like, ‘Why don’t you get the CEO on the phone–let him talk to me and then maybe I’ll come in?'” recalls King, who didn’t even know who the CEO of Walmart was. “I was being cocky. The CEO of the world’s largest retailer wasn’t going to meet with me just so I’d do an interview.”advertisementThe next thing King knew, Walmart arranged for him to join a videoconference with CEO Mike Duke. “It was the strangest thing,” King says. “Mike’s office in Bentonville is the original one that Sam Walton had, complete with 1970s wood paneling. I was looking at this video, thinking, Where is this place?”Over the next 45 minutes, though, Duke made what King calls an irresistible pitch. After years of seeing his company lag online, Duke swore that digital was now a priority for Walmart. Duke had restructured the company, placing e-commerce on equal footing with Walmart’s other, much larger divisions. He had made serious investments in high-tech talent, acquiring several startups. One, a 65-person social media firm called Kosmix with expertise in search and analytics, was the impetus for Walmart rechristening its Valley operations “@WalmartLabs.” Duke was looking for people who would revive the company’s sites and services, and energize its entire culture. He hoped to turn a company famous for rigid, coldly effective business processes into one that’s flexible, experimental, and entrepreneurial. In other words, Duke wanted to inject a bit of Silicon Valley into Bentonville, Arkansas. In the summer of 2011, King signed up as CTO of Walmart.com. “We’ve hired hundreds of incredibly talented people, in Silicon Valley and around the world,” says Duke of his aggressive moves. “We are playing to win.”“We are uniquely positioned to give customers anytime, anywhere access by combining the smartphone, online, and the physical stores,” says Walmart CEO Mike Duke.WalmartLabs is now housed in a boxy office tower in San Bruno, California, a few miles south of San Francisco. In just over a year, it has helped Walmart.com revamp its search engine; presciently identified the potential of the now red-hot “social gifting” market, where companies use social media cues to suggest presents; and this fall launched a test that offers same-day shipping to customers.This last move is a clear signal of Walmart’s serious intent to compete in digital e-commerce–and blunt the looming threat of Amazon, which has its own same-day shipping experiments. Having marginalized Barnes & Noble and Best Buy, Jeff Bezos has his eyes on a bigger target. Amazon has been moving aggressively to sell Walmart staples such as diapers, soap, pet food, and cereal, even letting customers subscribe for items they want to receive regularly. Walmart is the world’s biggest grocer, and a central part of its strategy is that the millions of folks who visit its stores weekly to buy food will purchase a lot of other stuff. That’s a key reason Walmart’s 2011 revenue of $419 billion dwarfed Amazon’s 2011 sales of $48 billion.In e-commerce, however, Walmart is a distant challenger. The company has never broken out its Internet revenue, though in 2011, the analyst Internet Retailer estimated it to be $4.9 billion. In October, Walmart projected that global e-commerce would be $9 billion in the year ahead. Meanwhile, Amazon has been on a tear, with sales rocketing toward $100 billion annually in 2015. Analysts I spoke to believe Amazon has eaten into Walmart’s sales of books, music, DVDs, electronics, and even toys. “When people started to say that Amazon was going to be the Walmart of e-commerce,” notes Scot Wingo, CEO of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce technology and consulting firm, “that’s when we started to see more signs of life from Walmart.”It would be a radical oversimplification to chalk up Walmart’s digital revival solely to a hungry competitor (and Walmart execs often insist, perhaps a bit too strenuously, that they are not fixated on Amazon). No, Walmart needs to get digital because that’s where its customers are headed. Soon everyone’s phone will be smart enough for easy shopping. With Internet-enabled tablets selling for well under $200, lower-income families are already turning into online customers. “The way our customers shop in an increasingly interconnected world is changing,” Duke says.advertisement“I’m not going to be Chicken Little and tell you the company is going to go away if we don’t get the Internet and mobile right,” adds Neil Ashe, the company’s top-ranking e-commerce executive. “We have an obligation to the mission to get this thing right because the customer expects it of us.” Like the best Internet companies, Walmart obsesses about its customers more than its competition.In 2012, Walmart celebrated its 50th birthday. In its first 25 years, Walmart became the world’s biggest general merchandise retailer. But Sam Walton wanted to be a grocer as well. “A lot of people said that was crazy,” says Joel Anderson, the CEO of Walmart.com U.S. who joined the company in 2007. “Twenty-five years ago, we couldn’t even spell grocery. People thought we’d never figure it out.”

Anderson says the next 25 years are about becoming a digital company. “In the first few years, were we tinkering and experimenting and not moving? There’s some truth to that. But look at our history. When Walmart leans into something, it’s like a tidal wave.”In April 2011, Walmart bought Kosmix for a reported $300 million. Kosmix’s expertise lay in simplifying the sprawl of the web for users; its algorithms were novel because they tried to understand what a user wanted rather than just match her query text. For example, if a user searched for “presidential election,” Google would return pages that contain variations on that term. Kosmix could find pages that were part of that topic even if the pages didn’t contain the specific phrase. It then sorted them into categories such as candidate biographies, news stories, and polling data. Only in the past year have Google and Microsoft’s Bing added Kosmix-like topic pages to their search results, but Kosmix’s founders, Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman, hit upon the idea way back in 2004.Walmart wanted to apply Kosmix’s artificial intelligence to commerce, but it also wanted the real brains behind the tech. Harinarayan, 45, and Rajaraman, 40, both born and raised in India and graduates of the prestigious IIT Madras university, have been inseparable friends since they met as PhD students at Stanford in the 1990s. Both skinny and short, they have more than a passing physical resemblance, and they operate as a united pair. In the Valley, which loves its duos (such as Bill and Dave, Jobs and Woz, Ev and Biz), they’re known as Venky and Anand.The pair first tackled the problem of organizing the web in 1996, when they founded Junglee.com. In 1998, Jeff Bezos acquired the company for $250 million in stock. He realized that Junglee’s technology would help its customers compare prices with other online stores, a bold move toward transparency that turned out to further solidify the company’s hold on those customers. Rajaraman became Amazon’s director of technology, while Harinarayan was charged with creating Amazon’s Marketplace, where any merchant could sell its wares on Amazon’s site. “I’d meet with Jeff for a couple hours every week,” says Harinarayan. “What we came up with in 2000 was pretty much what Amazon has executed on since then.” Analysts estimate 40% of the goods sold on Amazon are via Marketplace.advertisementThe duo left Amazon in 2000, and after a four-year stint as venture capitalists, founded Kosmix. The company had a unique ability to find meaningful information in the cacophony of the web. An application it built, called Tweetbeat, became one of the hottest ways to explore Twitter during the 2010 soccer World Cup, because it made it easy to discover who was talking about your favorite team or even individual players. That’s part of what lured Walmart execs–they salivated at the idea of bringing this kind of intelligence to shopping. People are always offering clues about products on social media–writing reviews, liking brands, checking into stores, announcing the products they want to buy.And what lured Harinarayan and Rajaraman, besides the money? They saw an opportunity to do something more interesting than merely replicate their work at Amazon for its rival. (In a delicious irony, Bezos profited from the Walmart deal–he was an early investor in Kosmix.) “What has changed since Amazon became big?” Rajaraman asks rhetorically. “You can connect the social experience, the in-store experience, and the online experience. Nobody could do that.”When the Kosmix team landed at Walmart in the summer of 2011, they found a mess. “The only thing Silicon Valley about Walmart was that we had an office in Silicon Valley,” says Gibu Thomas, the senior VP who heads up Walmart’s mobile tech team and was one of the first executives to approach Kosmix about a deal. “It was run like a traditional IT organization,” he says, explaining that Walmart used outsourced, off-the-shelf systems to power key parts of its site. Worse, Walmart’s 27 worldwide subsidiaries used incompatible technologies; the sites did not connect seamlessly with the stores or with Walmart’s legendary supply chain.Walmart.com’s search engine epitomized its failure. “Executives at Walmart–at the board level–were running searches and saying, ‘This is embarrassing,'” says Sri Subramaniam, the WalmartLabs exec who ran the rebuilding effort. If you used Walmart.com’s old search engine to check out “smartphones,” you’d get links to a couple of cell-phone chargers, not the iPhone. A “cotton socks” query returned results for cotton candy and balls of yarn.The Kosmix team, so deeply ensconced in the ways of Silicon Valley, worried that cultural differences would hamper their efforts to turn the site around. “My first reaction was, Wow, this is going to be interesting,” says Chris Bolte, who works on Walmart’s search marketing systems. But those fears proved unfounded. More than a half-dozen people on both sides of the acquisition say that Kosmix’s integration into Walmart was amazingly smooth. “I think part of it was that Walmart knew that they needed us, that this was a turnaround situation,” Subramaniam says.Their first job was to create a new search engine. It took just 10 months, with just a dozen or so engineers. Walmart will not discuss specific sales figures, but execs report that the improved search tools have increased the number of people who are converted from visitors to buyers on Walmart.com by as much as 15%. If you search for cotton socks now, you’ll actually find them.advertisementWhen Harinarayan and Rajaraman transformed Kosmix into WalmartLabs, they put roughly half the staff on such boring but crucial tasks. They deployed the rest as true lab workers, with the freedom to experiment in small teams on far-flung new ideas. “We organize these teams as mini startups with six to eight people,” says Harinarayan, who learned from Bezos’s organizational innovation of so-called two-pizza teams. “One person acts as CEO, and they have a clear business goal. We step out of the way and let these guys run it.”One of the first projects born from this approach was Shopycat, a gift-recommendation app that Walmart.com launched on Facebook before the 2011 holidays. Shopycat scans your friends’ profiles to identify interesting gift ideas from their stream of likes, comments, and status updates, discerning if the “Ted” your pal is raving about is the geeky ideas festival or the Seth MacFarlane stoner comedy. Shopycat then seeks out an appropriate gift for such a stoner/thinker from Walmart’s product database. Walmart says Shopycat led to an increase in purchases on the site, though it won’t say by how much. For the 2012 holidays, the team built Shopycat into a section of Walmart.com called Walmart Gifts; customers will log in with their Facebook or Twitter account to get personalized recommendations.“We’re going to find ways to live at the edge,” says Walmart e-commerce chief Neil Ashe. “Every three or six months, you’ll see something come out from us that will make you say ‘Wow.'” Another clever retail application of WalmartLabs’s core technology has been to use spikes in social network chatter to predict demand for out-of-the-ordinary products. Last year, the team correctly anticipated heightened customer interest in cake-pop makers based on social media conversations on Facebook and Twitter. A few months later, it noticed growing interest in electric juicers, tied in part to the popularity of the juice-crazy documentary Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. The team sends the data to Walmart’s buyers, who right now are only using it to confirm its other research. But as these signals become stronger, execs say it will play a larger role in purchasing decisions.WalmartLabs has also created projects that just get customers to think differently about Walmart and e-commerce, including Get on the Shelf, an online contest for people to submit their own inventions to go on sale at Walmart. Get on the Shelf was a social marketing blockbuster, garnering more than 4,000 submissions, over 1 million votes, and news hits in small towns across America. Then there’s Goodies, a subscription service in which Walmart customers pay seven dollars a month for home delivery of a gourmet food box–creating a discerning test market for the grocer in the process.By themselves, none of these projects will single-handedly boost Walmart’s e-commerce business. Taken together, though, they showcase a new dynamism at the retailing giant. “We’re going to find ways to live at the edge,” says Walmart e-commerce exec Ashe. “Every three or six months, you’ll see something come out from us that will make you say ‘Wow.’ “The next step, says Harinarayan, is about “scaling up Labs.” But he and Rajaraman won’t be part of it: In June, Harinarayan and Rajaraman announced that they were leaving WalmartLabs. To many outsiders, the abruptness of the founders’ departure seemed troubling. It had been only a year since the acquisition, and they hadn’t completed the “earn-out” phase, meaning they wouldn’t receive their full share from the sale. Was their departure a sign that dynamic tech entrepreneurs felt smothered by Walmart’s corporate culture? Or was it that Walmart could no longer tolerate leaving these hands-off leaders in charge?advertisementHarinarayan and Rajaraman dismiss the speculation. They say they had spent eight years on the startup, and they were simply ready for time off. One Friday not long after the announcement, I meet Harinarayan at a coffee shop across the street from Kosmix’s first office in downtown Mountain View. He’s the picture of a relaxed man. After chatting about Walmart and Amazon for an hour, he told me he was free to keep talking, as he didn’t have anything else to do that day. And he is quite sanguine about walking away from the money. “Given the fortune that Anand and I have had in our careers, if you’re doing anything just for money, at this point it’s going to be the wrong thing to do.”Jeremy King took over as the head of WalmartLabs, and to get a sense of where he will bring the skunk works, I visit the gleaming new Walmart store off the Almaden Expressway in San Jose where Jonathan Sherman, a WalmartLabs product manager, gives me a peek into the digital dimension being woven into this temple of American retail.That future begins, like everything else, with a smartphone app. Walmart imagines that as you go through an average day, you’ll remember things you need–milk, bread, a new tennis racquet, a toy truck for your nephew’s birthday–and tell the voice-enabled Walmart app. The app will list each item’s location inside your local Walmart and include product info; eventually, it will also learn your preferences and offer recommendations. And once you’re actually in the store, you’ll be able to summon an associate to help you.
Walmart’s current iPhone app has only a few of these features: The voice-list system works very well, and, depending on which store you’re in and what you’re looking for, the app can sometimes locate your product.At the moment, though, it won’t show you extensive product info for all items, and it won’t summon store help. The company has begun to test mobile checkout in select stores. As part of it, Walmart presents customers with a running tally of their total bill as they shop, the first explicit nod in my journey through WalmartLabs to the fact that millions of Walmart shoppers are on tight budgets.This effort to reinvent the in-store shopping experience is an argument that Walmart’s physical stores are a great asset, not a liability. “We are uniquely positioned to give customers anytime, anywhere access to Walmart by combining the smartphone, online, and the physical stores,” Duke says. “Ultimately, that will give us an edge over any competitor.” When I ask Walmart executives about Amazon’s moves to offer more customers next-day and same-day shipping, many were amused. “It’s fun to see them trying to be us,” says Walmart.com CEO Anderson. “We have more than 4,000 forward-deployed fulfillment centers and we’re already doing shipments from some of them. Some people call them stores.”“If you think about the last 20 years of retail, how people shop in a store has not changed,” Thomas says. “The question we’re asking is, how do you bring to a store the capabilities that have made e-commerce successful? With 200 million customers a week, if you can increase the average basket size by a dollar–that’s billions of dollars every year.” In fact, it’s more than $10 billion–more than its projected annual e-commerce revenue this year.advertisementIf Walmart fails in its digital transformation, it won’t be for lack of resources or possibilities. Ninety-six percent of Americans live within 20 miles of a Walmart. No one has as much money; no one has a better supply chain; no one has such a close connection with so many customers. Walmart execs know this. “We’ll spend more on capital expenditures this year than Amazon has spent in its entire history,” Ashe tells me (hyperbolically).That size, however, is also Walmart’s greatest enemy. WalmartLabs’s two-pizza teams can come up with a thousand innovative ways to improve shopping, online and off, but none matter if the company’s execution is slow and bureaucratic. And the fact is that implementing these ideas will always be complex. Every change to how items are delivered, or how customers navigate stores, or how applications work with the company’s existing IT structure is a maneuver that requires the coordination of thousands of moving parts.But Walmart can succeed online without becoming the Amazon of the web. The phrase I hear most often from Walmart people is that the only way the company will win online is “by being Walmart.” And they’re right. Walmart doesn’t need to be something radically different. The company that mastered IT in the service of unbeatable prices must now master web technology. It doesn’t need to chase Amazon so much as it needs to identify how a digital Walmart can be as much a part of its customers’ lives as the stores are today.And it has to think long term. It may take a decade or more for Walmart to be a successful digital retailer. “Somebody at one of the board meetings asked me, ‘Neil, how long is this going to take, and how much is it going to cost?'” Ashe recalls. “And I said, ‘It’s going to take the rest of our careers, and it’s going to cost whatever it costs. Because this isn’t a project, this is the company.'”advertisementRelated StoriesIdeasCRISPR Pioneer Jennifer Doudna On Gene Editing’s Potential For Good And EvilIdeasThe Ethics Of CRISPRMagazineThe CEO Of Flywheel Sports Wants You To Celebrate Your FailuresadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasIs Your Country Ready For A Catastrophe?IdeasThe Philanthropy World Is Frightened That Trump’s Tax Plan Is Going To Slow DonationsIdeasCould Hawaii Be The First State To Offer A Basic Income?EntertainmentEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarEntertainmentOpen Letter To SNL: Please Let Melissa McCarthy Do Spicey On TV Right NowEntertainment“Fairy Lives Don’t Matter”: Will Smith’s Fantasy Cop Movie On Netflix Is a Racial AllegoryCo.DesignProductGo Inside The ISS, The Most Expensive Structure Ever BuiltProductThis Rotary Phone Is A Delightfully Analog Way To Read The WebProductSomeday You Could Swallow This Wireless Robot Like A PillFast CompanyLeadershipSix Words And Phrases That Make Everyone Hate Working With YouEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarLeadershipFour Work-Life Questions To Ponder On Vacation This Summer

SAN BRUNO, Calif. — A plucky Silicon Valley company, forced to compete for talented engineers, is trying it all — recruiting billboards on Highway 101; workplace perks like treadmill workstations and foosball tables; and conference rooms named after celebrities like Rihanna and Justin Bieber.The name of that arriviste company?Walmart.The country’s largest retailer, which for years didn’t blink at would-be competitors, is now under such a threat from Amazon that it is frantically playing catch-up by learning the technology business, including starting @WalmartLabs at Walmart Global E-Commerce, its dot-com division.The two retail behemoths, one the king of the physical store and the other the conqueror of the online world, are battling over e-commerce — competing for the most talented engineers, trying to gain the upper hand in the new frontier of same-day delivery and warring over online pricing.They want to control not just Internet shopping but all shopping. Even as Walmart pours money into technology, Amazon is building a physical presence across the nation, adding warehouses and pickup locations. Both companies’ moves indicate that they believe the future of commerce is not just stores and not just online but a combination of the two.

“Don’t think for a second that Jeff Bezos is not a capitalist,” Neil M. Ashe, chief executive of Walmart Global E-Commerce, said of the belief of Mr. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, in low prices and paper-thin margins. “They’re just playing a game, which is, ‘We’re just going to wait out the world.’ ”Amazon declined to comment.Although the fierce competition between Walmart and Amazon is occurring in all areas, to get the technological edge Walmart has to succeed in San Bruno.The company has had a small presence near Silicon Valley for more than a decade, but until recently, engineers in the area barely knew it existed. It signed a lease three years ago for the San Bruno office, north of the valley — and across the street from YouTube — and is opening another this fall in Sunnyvale, home of Yahoo, in the heart of the valley. It is trying hard to prove it is one of the cool kids.For example, at press events in Bentonville, Ark., Walmart’s headquarters, the menu tends to be ham sandwiches, chips and iced tea. At a recent event in San Bruno, it was white asparagus panna cotta with house-smoked salmon tartar, morel mushroom macaroons and charcuterie from a whole pig. Borrowing a page from Google and Twitter, the company offers hack days when engineers can work on whatever they want.The changes are more than cosmetic, though. This year, @WalmartLabs has gone on a start-up shopping spree, buying four companies — Torbit, OneOps, Tasty Labs and Inkiru — that build things like tools to crunch data and speed up Web sites. The acquisitions included some of the start-ups’ founders and engineers, the time-honored way for Silicon Valley companies to hire the talented employees they need to build better Web and mobile tools.Walmart has hundreds of open jobs at its office here. This summer, the company hired 150 people from companies like Yahoo and eBay.The company’s pitch to engineers is that Walmart moves quickly and has huge problems to solve, even if it is not a nimble newcomer or a buzzworthy start-up.

“There’s big data and there’s Walmart big data,” said Ravi Raj, vice president for mobile and social products at @WalmartLabs. “Every week we release half a dozen features.”

Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a Silicon Valley recruiting firm that has recruited for the company before, said Walmart’s scale was attractive to young engineers. Still, he said, the competition is fierce.“The kind of people they’re going to be looking for — big data and e-commerce type of people — those are the same kinds of people Silicon Valley cares about,” he said.Amazon, which is based in Seattle, also has a Silicon Valley presence; its Lab126 research company, located a few miles from Apple’s headquarters, developed the Kindle and is working on other mobile devices. Amazon is a much bigger player online, with $74.4 billion in revenue expected for 2013. While Walmart’s total revenue is close to $500 billion, it has said it expects just a fraction of that, $10 billion, in e-commerce revenue for the year ending January 2014.

Walmart.com had 62.5 million unique visitors in August, compared with Amazon’s 133 million, according to Compete, which tracks Web use.“Amazon is the Walmart of the post-2000 period,” said Matt Nemer, an analyst at Wells Fargo.Walmart was slow to embrace online shopping, keeping its Web operations separate and haltingly adopting new technology. These days, though, it is trying to turn its 4,100 stores in the United States and many of its 6,200 stores overseas into e-commerce assets.Two-thirds of the United States population is within five miles of a Walmart, according to the company, and more than 10 percent of items ordered online are shipped from stores. Countries in which it has a physical presence for e-commerce include Brazil, China and Britain.It is also allowing customers to pick up online orders in stores or, in a test in Washington, in lockers. It is trying same-day delivery in five markets, and grocery delivery in the Bay Area and Denver.Executives say Walmart wants to become almost as fast as Amazon, but for people who can’t afford the $79 fee of Amazon’s Prime service, with its free two-day shipping.

Amazon has been building warehouses throughout the United States as it tries to expedite its shipping and conquer online grocery delivery. It has had lockers at stores like 7-Eleven for about a year, though in September, RadioShack and Staples stopped participating in the program. Abroad, Amazon has moved even faster with services like same-day delivery and groceries.Following Amazon, Walmart has revamped its online and mobile technology. It has software to watch social media like Pinterest for popular products and to monitor online prices and lower them accordingly or alert merchants.And it has created a mobile app that flips into in-store mode when customers enter a store and guides them to the milk or celery and offers digital coupons; customers can scan items as they shop for quick self-checkout.Analysts say that while Walmart’s scale and profitability give it an edge, its Web efforts still lag Amazon’s. The grocery delivery test, for instance, has gone on for two years without expansion. Mr. Nemer of Wells Fargo called many of the efforts, like lockers and same-day shipping, “blocking and tackling” without real relevance to Walmart’s dominance, or inferiority, in the new world of shopping.Mr. Ashe of Walmart said of those efforts, “The question is whether people want them.” Echoing Facebook’s motto on risk taking, “fail harder,” he said: “We fully expect, and want, to shut things down.”

And, he said, the culture clash between Bentonville and San Bruno has not been as great as one might expect.“We are of Walmart and Silicon Valley at the same time,” he said. “So we have a great cafeteria, but we don’t pay for all your food.”

 Correction: October 27, 2013  
An article last Sunday about Walmart’s efforts to catch up in online technology misstated the name of the company’s e-commerce division. It is Walmart Global E-Commerce — not @WalmartLabs, which is a unit of the e-commerce division.
