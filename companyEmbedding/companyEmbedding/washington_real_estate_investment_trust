Overview
The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

2013 and Earlier:
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust invests in a diversified range of income-producing property types. The company's business consists of the ownership, operation and development of real estate properties in the Washington/Baltimore region.

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust's primary IT hub is located with its headquarters in Rockville, MD. The internal IT department sometimes confers with product development in terms of overall technology strategy and planning.

The IT department is svelte and divided into core groups. Architecture and Development team oversees IT systems and infrastructure development. IT operations monitors the implementation of IT operations daily. Help Desk and IT Security team oversees IT troubleshooting and risk management. Application Development team oversees in-house application production and support.

The company relies primarily on Oracle JD Edwards software to support the business operations. Other technologies include Adobe and Microsoft products, SAP applications and CentOS.

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust has previously led initiatives in the areas of archiving software and storage-related cloud initiatives, and has decreased spending in data protection and recovery software, storage replication software, file system software, storage device management software, and storage infrastructure software. Washington Real Estate Investment Trust describes the NAS disk backup being too small as its biggest storage headache. 

Its top storage pain points are the need for better and more reliable off-site disaster recovery, the WAN being too slow, and the WAN optimization being too expensive. Washington Real Estate Investment Trust uses disk backup across NAS environment to back up its hybrid of block and file data. It uses backup exec as its main backup application. Its daily and weekly total data backup is 0.5TB and 2TB respectively, with a 7-8 hour backup window. Its backup growth is around 0.5.

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust's IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

APPRECIATION
Properties identified through HomeUnion's extensive Top Down property identification process, although not guaranteed, are predicted to increase in value over time.

High Yield ROI
100% Ownership of Property


360 Degree Support
Hassle Free Asset Management


Ease of Ownership
Diversification from the Stock Market



















“I was wary of investing remotely, but HomeUnion’s research helped me make an informed decision. My property is generating good returns, and with HomeUnion’s help, I can continue to buy good cash flow homes around the country.”



Ramya Subramanian






“Thanks to HomeUnion, I now have direct, leveraged exposure to real estate through a diverse portfolio in multiple locations throughout the country. The properties cash flow and the process is streamlined. I trust their experience.”

Special Report: How Much Money Do House Flippers Make?How Smart Real Estate Investors are Flipping Houses in 2016.





How much money do house flippers make? According to RealtyTrac's U.S. Home Flipping Report, investors made an average gross profit of $65,993 per flip last quarter and an average gross profit per flip of $55,000 in the year 2015. 
		
		With the United States real estate market heating up, many people are getting into flipping houses. Cities with the highest number of flips include Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Miami. Cities with the highest profit on flips include St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Chicago, according to the report.

How to Find Discount Properties 
The first step to flipping a house is finding a discount property. The goal is to buy low and sell high and keep repair costs to a minimum.  Fortunately you can find bargain properties in many different areas of the U.S.
For example, if you live near the Tampa, Florida area, you will find bank-owned houses listed in the $10,000-$40,000 range.



Example: Here is a look inside a bank owned home purchased at a big discount. After upgrades the owners made a healthy profit.  Click Here for a Free DVD That Shows You How to Flip Houses

Many house rehabbers find undervalued houses by looking for foreclosures/bank owned properties - also called "REO" houses. Banks have carrying costs on any house in their inventory. 
Carrying costs include insurnace, taxes, and property maintenance. As a result, banks are often very motivated to get rid of their housing inventory - even if they have
to sell it at a discount.
HUD houses, which are foreclosed homes with an FHA backed mortgage, are also a source of bargain properties. HUD publishes all its houses on a website which makes it easy for 
investors to look for potential deals.

How to Get Funding for Your Flip If you do not have a lot of start up capital to work with, you can still get into flipping houses.  You can access to funding to flip houses so that you use only a fraction of your own money.  

One way to use other people's money to flip houses is to get a "Hard Money Loan".  A "Hard Money Lender" is an individual, or a group of wealthy individuals, who lend money for the purpose of rehabbing houses. It is a short term loan you repay monthly with the balance paid in full when the house is sold.  

Getting a hard money loan is easier than getting a loan from a bank. There is less paperwork and your credit history is not as big of a factor.  Often you can receive an approval in 48 to 72 hours and have the funds in as little as 7 days. 
Some Hard Money Lenders provide funding without checking your income or your credit report.
Using hard money will reduce your overall profit because you pay interest and points on the loan. 
However, it is a good strategy to use if you do not have funds set aside - or prefer not to put your own money at risk. 



Example: This home in California was purchased for $45,000. After repairs and upgrades it sold for $215,000. Click Here for a Free DVD That Shows You How to Flip Houses


What Repairs to Make to Maximize Profits

We asked an expert from Capital Rehab Group, a company that actively flips houses across the U.S., for advice on which repairs and upgrades are most important. Here is what he said:

Kitchen and Bathrooms. Redo them from top to bottom. If you are not sure what materials to use, look at homes that sold for top dollar per 
		square foot in the area and copy them.
Flooring. In most flips, use laminate hardwood flooring in the primary living areas and carpet in the bedrooms. Laminate hardwood flooring is difficult to tell apart from real hard wood.  It is not only much more durable, and scratch 
		resistant; it is also less expensive.
Paint. Paint every room in the home. If the walls have a lot of minor flaws in them, use flat paint. Otherwise, use an eggshell finish. And always use earth-tones. 

Landscaping. Donald Trump himself stated that you get a $10,000 return for every $1,000 you invest in landscaping. It is amazing what rocks, trees, and shrubs can do to increase
the perceived value of a property.  A good rule of thumb is to budget 1% to 2% of the final expected sale price of your home for landscaping.  Plant a couple flats of fresh flowers
the day before putting the house on the market.  This simple, inexpensive final step will drastically increase your overall profit.  
 

Roof. If the home needs a new roof, replace it.  But factor this into your costs before you purchase the home. 
 

HVAC. Make sure the home has a working heating and cooling system.  Air conditioning is a must in areas with warm climates like Florida and Texas.  
 

Garage. Other than paint, do not spend much money here.  

Back Patio. This is an often overlooked but important area.  A simple $1,500 deck with two chairs, a small table in between them, and a couple wine glasses sitting on the 
	  table paints an awesome picture in the head of the potential buyer.
 
Have you considered flipping houses? We asked our expert from Capital Rehab Group,  to outline what it takes to start flipping houses.

Capital Rehab Group explained that flipping houses isn't for everyone. There is risk in real estate, but explained you can minimize risk and the benefits of flipping houses are extremely rewarding.
Here are three strategies to be successful: 


 Only buy properties with lots of equity;
 Be realistic about your expected costs; 
 Seek knowledge from others with house flipping experience.

It is a well known fact that real estate plays a big role in the investments of the wealthy. Finding, Fixing, and Flipping houses is one way that people are making their
		way into real estate investing.  According to RealtyTrac, the average gross profit on a flip was $65,993 last quarter.

What Others Are Saying


Ben M. made a healthy profit on his first flip by purchasing a bank-owned property in a nice upstate New York neighborhood.



Tim Stevens, a full-time real estate investor from Tampa, Florida, flips 3-4 houses per month by purchasing mostly bank owned properties.






With so many bank-owned houses it’s possible to find properties for pennies on the dollar in many markets in the United States. 

(appraised value = $214,000, asking price = $92,000)

(appraised value = $118,000. Asking $32,000)

Here is a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom property in nice condition. Houses like this one can make a good entry-level flip.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
