Content Marketing Framework: Conversation
Your content is now a conversation. It’s a story that needs an audience to respond. So, yes, go out and create great content. Be the leader in your industry because you consistently share value. BUT, share it.
In addition to a solid strategy, team, and processes, there’s one key element of your framework that needs to be nurtured: a connection to, and conversations with, your consumers.
Talking with content
The core of your conversation will be the content that you create. If you are like many marketers, you may be wondering what to write about. Without question, write about things that interest your audience. Here are some posts to get you started:

21 Types of Content We Crave

Listening
Of course, there are two parts of any conversation: talking (your content) and listening. Not only do you need to set up listening posts, but you also need to figure out how to respond to the conversation. Here are some tips to get started:

Can B2B Marketers Become Content Whisperers?
How Your Content Marketing Benefits from a Listen, Ask, Share Approach
Tips and Tools for Better Listening for Content Marketing
14 Sources for Content Curation Inspiration

It’s inevitable that you will be having conversations via multiple social media channels. Because each channel has its own vibe and community, you’ll want to be cognizant of how you share info. 58 Social Media Tips for Content Marketing looks at the 14 popular channels and provides tips for each. You’ll also learn what percentage of B2B and B2C marketers use each one.

Conversation is the sixth step in building a successful content marketing strategy. Download our white paper, The CMI Content Marketing Framework: 7 Building Blocks to Success for an overview of the process, or learn about the other steps with our how-to guides on the right-hand side of the page.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the use of proceeds assuming the
sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale
by the Company.

CI believes that the sale of at least 25% of the offered shares herein could
allow us to implement our Plan of Operations. We expect to try to implement our
Plan of Operations even if we sell less than 25% of the shares offered herein,
but more funds would likely be necessary.

The above figures represent estimated costs.


The Company believes that there is an opportunity to generate revenues from the
teachers recruiting industry and the Online English teaching industry.
Competitors may enter this sector with superior services, conditions and
benefits. This would infringe on our customer base, have an adverse effect upon
our business and the results of our operations.


Company Description
Conversation Institute, Inc. ("CI") was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a
for-profit company on July 18, 2014. We are a development stage company that 
intends to enter the English learning and teaching market. CI intends to develop
an online based English School, for those who want to learn


 English anywhere 
with internet connection, according to their own schedule. For those who want to
teach English, we intend to recruit both qualified professionals and uncertified
instructors from North America to teach English abroad and on our Online English
School.

We plan to develop our business in three stages: the first stage will be devoted
in developing the Online English School and the English knowledge test. We
expect to complete this step within 120 days of the effective date of this
registration statement and we expect to invest 50% of the Net Proceeds from this
offering.

In the second stage, we intend to develop our employment placement contracts. We
expect to complete this step after 150 days of the effective date of this
registration statement and we expect to invest 10% of the Net Proceeds from this
offering.

The third stage consists of our sales and marketing campaign: we intend to hire
a specialized Marketing company to help us advertise our services. We expect to
reach an optimum point within 360 days of the effective date of this
registration statement, when we will start to run our business. We expect to
invest 40% of the Net Proceed from this offering.

The above figures represent estimated costs.


The Company believes that there is an opportunity to generate revenues from the
teachers recruiting industry and the Online English teaching industry.
Competitors may enter this sector with superior services, conditions and
benefits. This would infringe on our customer base, have an adverse effect upon
our business and the results of our operations.


Company Description
Conversation Institute, Inc. ("CI") was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a
for-profit company on July 18, 2014. We are a development stage company that 
intends to enter the English learning and teaching market. CI intends to develop
an online based English School, for those who want to learn


 English anywhere 
with internet connection, according to their own schedule. For those who want to
teach English, we intend to recruit both qualified professionals and uncertified
instructors from North America to teach English abroad and on our Online English
School.

We plan to develop our business in three stages: the first stage will be devoted
in developing the Online English School and the English knowledge test. We
expect to complete this step within 120 days of the effective date of this
registration statement and we expect to invest 50% of the Net Proceeds from this
offering.

In the second stage, we intend to develop our employment placement contracts. We
expect to complete this step after 150 days of the effective date of this
registration statement and we expect to invest 10% of the Net Proceeds from this
offering.

The third stage consists of our sales and marketing campaign: we intend to hire
a specialized Marketing company to help us advertise our services. We expect to
reach an optimum point within 360 days of the effective date of this
registration statement, when we will start to run our business. We expect to
invest 40% of the Net Proceed from this offering.

How Conversation Research Can Help Discover New Product LinesOne of the first case studies of conversation research I can remember is when Listerine used social listening tools to find out what their customers said about their product. They discovered that many talked about the taste and burn in using it, but also that people sometimes use it to fight toenail fungus.
While that may sound funny, it’s no joke when you’re a brand manager and seeking to create new revenue streams for your company. Could Listerine have repackaged the formula as an application to help fight toenail fungus? Perhaps. Whether or not they did isn’t the point.
The point is are you looking at your customer’s conversations online to discover insights like use cases which can help your product team develop better or even different products?
We took a close look at Dirt Devil recently, not because they’re a client, but we wanted to run some tests on a consumer product that wasn’t difficult to distinguish from similarly named products. (We easily weeded out references to the weather anomaly and off-road race course and race truck by the same name.) These are the use cases we discovered:

Pet hair, hair, college dorms and hardwood floors were expected. But look some of the others.
An air pump for blacksmithing? That might be a new product idea. Sticker removal? That’s interesting. Beekeeping? Okay, maybe a little weird but what if you dive into the conversation and discover that the lower power hand-held vacs are able to remove bees from honeycombs without harming them and beekeepers everywhere would pay for one with larger receptacles?
If you’re only looking at word clouds and pie graphs of themes, sentiments and genders, you’re not seeing the fullness of the conversation. From a product innovation and feature enhancement standpoint, conversation research can be a treasure trove of opportunity and, eventually, treasure itself.
And as an aside, none of this type of conversation research is available using just software. These conversations about Dirt Devil were filtered and coded by hand. (Okay, by hands on a computer.) But you don’t get use cases for products as an output of automatic or algorithmic topic surfacing.
Are you ready to do some product innovation research with CRI? Drop us a line. We’d be glad to chat.
