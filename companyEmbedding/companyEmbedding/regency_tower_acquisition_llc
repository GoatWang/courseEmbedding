Underhill Associates LLC has closed on the acquisition of the troubled Regency Tower condominium development in Louisville and has given it a new name.
The 14-story luxury condo property at U.S. 42 and Seminary Drive in the Seminary Woods development has been rebranded The George at 42, and Underhill Associates plans to start work on the unfinished tower immediately.

                            Regency Tower, a 14-story condo tower, will be sold under court supervision. Nearly 75… more 










 


As we previously reported, the building went into foreclosure in 2013, and Regency Tower Acquisition Ltd. — a company formed by Underhill Associates principals Jeff Underhill, Todd Underhill, Colin Underhill and Matt Willinger — bid just more than $9 million to buy the property from PNC Bank. The sale closed on Friday.




Colin Underhill previously said the group would own about 111,000 square feet of the tower's 160,000 square feet of condo space. The remainder of the property, nearly 50,000 square feet, is owned by private residents who previously purchased finished condos.
In a news release issued Monday, the Underhills said the initial plan is to make "significant cosmetic and construction updates," which will include redecorating and refurnishing the site's common areas and building out several model units.
In an interview Monday morning, Colin Underhill said his firm will spend about $1 million out the gate to restore the building to its original, "pristine" condition and that it could invest as much as $11.5 million to complete the condo units.




 


The model units will show off what The George will offer buyers, including outdoor balconies, underground parking, a pool, a fitness center and a climate-controlled wine cellar.
“The Regency Tower is a first class building in one of Louisville’s most prominent neighborhoods but suffered greatly as result of the real estate crash in 2008. We’re aware of the challenges in revitalizing this property, but we’ve never shied away from a challenge,” Colin Underhill said in the release. “We want people to look at this building with fresh eyes every time they pass it on 42. We intend to make The George the ultimate destination for upscale living in Louisville.”

The Underhills plan to have a sales center on site next month and said model units should be available by Thanksgiving. Colin Underhill told me Monday morning that condos will be available as finished units or shell only, with the cost ranging from $250,000 for the least expensive, unfinished unit to as much as $2 million for a finished penthouse unit.
The Underhills anticipate the condos will appeal most to baby boomers and empty nesters who want upscale living at a market rate. You can find out more at the tower's website.
“We see a pent-up demand in the market for this type of product for our target demographic," Underhill said in the release. "There is strong demand and a relatively small supply with this building, so we are looking forward to getting started.”
Regency Tower's original developer, Seminary Woods LLC, owed PNC more than $22 million in principal, interest and expenses when the property was foreclosed on, according to court records.

Regency Energy Partners Closes Merger With PVR Partners




Substantially Expands Geographic Footprint in Marcellus, Utica and 
      Granite Wash Supply Areas


Positions Regency as One of the Largest Independent Gas Gathering and 
      Processing MLPs in the Country






March 21, 2014 08:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regency Energy Partners LP (NYSE: 
      RGP) and PVR Partners, L.P. (NYSE: PVR) today closed Regency’s 
      previously announced acquisition of PVR. Regency acquired all of PVR’s 
      outstanding units for a total purchase price of approximately $5.6 
      billion (based on Regency’s closing price of $26.70 per unit on March 
      20, 2014), including approximately $1.8 billion of assumed debt. In the 
      merger, PVR unitholders received (on a per unit basis) 1.020 Regency 
      common units and a one-time cash payment of $0.262 per unit 
      (representing the difference between PVR’s annualized quarterly 
      distribution immediately prior to the merger and 1.020 times Regency’s 
      annualized quarter distribution immediately prior to the merger).
    


      The combination creates a fully-integrated midstream partnership 
      platform by further expanding Regency’s position in the Granite Wash in 
      the Mid-Continent and adding a strong geographic footprint in the 
      Marcellus and Utica Shales in the Appalachia Basin. This acquisition is 
      expected to allow Regency to benefit from increased scale, enhanced 
      geographic diversification and a growing, fee-based asset portfolio, 
      while delivering additional appealing service options to customers. In 
      addition, the high level of producer activity around the combined asset 
      base positions Regency to capture additional upside from organic growth 
      opportunities.
    

      “This is a compelling, strategic opportunity for Regency, and we are 
      excited to see this merger come together,” said Mike Bradley, president 
      and chief executive officer of Regency. “The addition of PVR’s asset 
      base in the Marcellus, Utica and Granite Wash supply areas provides 
      Regency with diversification into attractive, high-growth regions, and 
      also provides substantial opportunities for accretion through ongoing 
      and proposed organic growth projects. These projects are expected to 
      provide a platform for growth in EBITDA and DCF over the coming years, 
      which we believe strengthens our long-term distribution outlook.”
    

      “I would also like to thank PVR’s management team for their support in 
      seeing this transaction through,” continued Bradley. “The combination of 
      these assets and the addition of a talented employee base will further 
      position Regency as one of the premier midstream service providers in 
      the country.”
    

      The PVR assets include a network of natural gas midstream pipelines and 
      processing plants located principally in two prolific producing 
      areas—the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Appalachia and the Granite Wash 
      in the Mid-Continent region—as well as coal and natural resource 
      properties located in the Appalachian, Illinois and San Juan basins, 
      which are leased to experienced operators in exchange for royalty 
      payments.
    

      Effective with the closing of the market yesterday, PVR ceased to be a 
      publicly traded company and its common stock discontinued trading on the 
      NYSE.
    

      This release includes “forward-looking” statements. Forward-looking 
      statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly 
      to historical or current facts. Statements using words such as 
      “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “project,” “plan,” “expect,” 
      “continue,” “estimate,” “goal,” “forecast,” “may” or similar expressions 
      help identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe our 
      forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and 
      current expectations and projections about future events, we cannot give 
      any assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. 
      Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, 
      uncertainties and assumptions. These risks and uncertainties include the 
      risks that Regency’s other pending transactions may not be consummated 
      or the benefits contemplated by this transaction or Regency’s other 
      pending transactions may not be realized. Additional risks include: 
      volatility in the price of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, 
      declines in the credit markets and the availability of credit for the 
      Partnership as well as for producers connected to the Partnership’s 
      system and its customers, the level of creditworthiness of, and 
      performance by the Partnership’s counterparties and customers, the 
      Partnership's ability to access capital to fund organic growth projects 
      and acquisitions, including significant acquisitions, and the 
      Partnership’s ability to obtain debt and equity financing on 
      satisfactory terms, the Partnership's use of derivative financial 
      instruments to hedge commodity and interest rate risks, the amount of 
      collateral required to be posted from time-to-time in the Partnership's 
      transactions, changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and demand 
      for the Partnership's services, changes in laws and regulations 
      impacting the midstream sector of the natural gas industry, weather and 
      other natural phenomena, acts of terrorism and war, industry changes 
      including the impact of consolidations and changes in competition, the 
      Partnership's ability to obtain required approvals for construction or 
      modernization of the Partnership's facilities and the timing of 
      production from such facilities, and the effect of accounting 
      pronouncements issued periodically by accounting standard setting 
      boards. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may differ materially 
      from those expressed in such forward-looking statements.
    

      These and other risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in 
      filings made by the Partnership with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, which are available to the public. The Partnership 
      undertakes no obligation to update publicly or to revise any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise.

        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREPartners in Underhill Associates have closed on the purchase of Regency Tower, the luxury high-rise building on U.S. 42 at Seminary Drive that they are renaming The George.The owners plan "to reinvigorate the building in many respects," including "significant cosmetic and construction updates, redecorating and refurnishing common areas, as well as the completion of numerous model units," according to an announcement.The units have large balconies and site amenities include underground parking, a pool, a gym, and a climate-controlled wine cellar.The 14-story building has 63 units, including a penthouse, and offers spectacular views as far as downtown and the new East End Bridge.   The property is expected to cater to baby boomers and empty-nesters looking to stay close to their family and current neighborhood, without the burden of home maintenance, the announcement said.The new owner is Regency Tower Acquisition, LLC., a group formed by principals in Underhill Associates -- Colin, Todd, and Jeff Underhill and Matt Willinger.  It purchased the property from PNC Bank.  The new owner takes possession of 43 units, but not the remaining 20 that have been sold.“The Regency Tower is a first-class building in one of Louisville’s most prominent neighborhoods but suffered greatly as the result of the real estate crash in 2008. We’re aware of the challenges in revitalizing this property, but we’ve never shied away from a challenge,” said Colin Underhill.The name, The George, is meant to recognize a founding father of Louisville, George Rogers Clark, but also the late founder of the Underhill firm, George Underhill, the owners said.Top stories around the CJTop execs ousted at KenutckyOne HealthSuper-powerful narcotics threaten Kentucky12 bills to watch of GOP takes the Kentucky HouseWho took home an Emmy Award?In Bardstown, bourbon is a way of lifeU of L surges into top 5 after KO of Florida State**********The group headed by Underhill Associates partners submitted the best bid last spring to acquire the troubled Regency Tower.The building went into lender-forced foreclosure in 2013.  The Underhill group bid just over $9 million to acquire the property.  The group was then recommended by NTS Development Co., the court-appointed receiver, to acquire the site.Condo units in the project have previously been priced at up to $6 million for a penthouse.The tower opened in 2008 and about 113,000 square feet of space remains available for sale.The announcement said that the purchase of the building through a foreclosure sale will allow the new owner "to offer high-end living at a market rate price point."“We see a pent-up demand in the market for this type of product for our target demographic. There is strong demand and a relatively small supply,” Colin Underhill said.He said unfinished units are expected to sell for $250,000 to $1.25 million, with the cost of finished units starting at around $400,000.The George sales center will open to prospective buyers in October, with model units set to be completed shortly thereafter.For more information, visit TheGeorgeat42.com.Reporter Sheldon S.
