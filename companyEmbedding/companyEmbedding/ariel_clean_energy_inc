	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, AND GOING CONCERN



	 


	Ariel Clean Energy Inc. (“Ariel” or “the Company”) began its existence as the Pacific Development Corporation which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on September 21, 1992. On March 23, 2000, Pacific and Cheshire Holdings, Inc. were merged into a single corporation existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with Cheshire Holdings, Inc. being the surviving corporation. The name of the surviving corporation was changed to Cheshire Distributors, Inc. On July 17, 2003, Cheshire Distributors, Inc. changed its name to LMIC, Inc. and on October 31, 2012 changed its name to Z Holdings, Inc.  Ariel Clean Energy, Inc. adopted fresh start accounting on May 6, 2005 with an objective to acquire or merge with an operating business.


	 


	Big Time Acquisition (BTA) was originally organized to acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. On October 29, 2012, by written consent in lieu of a meeting, the respective Boards of Directors and requisite majority shareholders of Ariel and Big Time Acquisition, Inc. approved the merger of Big Time Acquisition, Inc. into Ariel with Ariel as the surviving corporation.


	 


	Immediately before the effective time of merger, any and all outstanding shares of Big Time Acquisition, Inc. held by Ariel Clean Energy, Inc. were canceled, and at the closing of the Merger Agreement, Ariel issued a total of 90,000 restricted Class A common shares to the former shareholders of Big Time Acquisition, Inc. for their then outstanding shares of Big Time common stock. In the share exchange, Ariel received 90,000 shares of Big Time common stock representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Big Time, which were deemed to be canceled. As a result of the Merger Agreement, Ariel is now the surviving company of the merger pursuant to Delaware General Corporate Law (DGCL), and deemed to be Successor Registrant. The issuance of such shares was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.


	 


	On July 15, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved to amend the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company's name from Z Holdings, Inc. to Ariel Clean Energy, Inc.


	 




	Going concern and Liquidity Considerations




	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company does not have material assets, nor does it have operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $172,435. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the company cannot continue in existence. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company, including compliance costs for being a public company.


	 



	NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	 


	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.


	 




	 




	F-4







	 






	Table of Contents






	 


	In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2017.


	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Reclassifications






	 


	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 


	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 



	Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "believes" and similar language. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed herein as well as in the "Description of Business - Risk Factors" section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed on March 14, 2017. You should carefully review the risks described in our Annual Report and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.



	 



	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.



	 



	All references in this Form 10-Q to the "Company," "Ariel Clean Energy," “Ariel,” "we," "us," or "our" are to Ariel Clean Energy, Inc.




	 




	General Overview



	 


	We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.


	 


	We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.


	 


	In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management will no longer retain a majority control of our company. In addition, it is likely that as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, one or more new officers and directors, would join our Company.


	 


	We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. We believe that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered corporation. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.


	 


	We have not yet entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate business opportunity or acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue a transaction if an appropriate opportunity is identified.

	Table of Contents






	 


	Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through loans from a company controlled by our management, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise additional funds privately. We believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we locate a prospective business opportunity through which we can pursue our plan of operation. Further, we expect that any new acquisition or business opportunities that may become available to our company will require additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail.

	Our working capital deficiency increased by $17,693 as of March 31, 2017, from December 31, 2016.  This was driven by the increase in amounts due to a related party for paying the company’s operating expenses.


	 



	Cash Flows



	 



	Cash Flow from Operating Activities



	 


	Net cash used in operating activities was $Nil for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had a net loss of $17,693, which was increased by a change in prepaid expenses of $6,487, and reduced by $31 for increase in accounts payable and $24,149 for increase in amounts due to a related party. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $15,993, which was increased by a change in prepaid expenses of $7,500, and reduced by $3,561 for increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $19,932 for increase in amounts due to a related party.


	 



	Cash Flow from Investing Activities



	 


	We did not use any cash in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

	Cash Flow from Financing Activities



	 


	We did not have any cash provided from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance.  We are a development stage corporation and have not generated sufficient revenues from operations to fully implement our business plan.  We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations.  Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and competition from larger organizations.  We will require equity and/or debt financing to provide for the capital required to implement our plans. We will require additional funds to operate for the next year.


	 


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.  If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations.


	 



	Capital Resources



	 


	We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of March 31, 2017.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred, obligation under a derivative instrument and obligation arising out of or a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain sufficient debt or equity financing to fund our operating expenses. This is because we have not commenced planned principal operations.  We have no actual or potential revenue source. There is no assurance we will ever reach this point. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing or acquiring a new business and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations in that new business. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. It is not probable we would be able to obtaining traditional loans from financial institutions because we have no business operations, no assets and no revenues.


	 


	There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through private placements, bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us.  We have been reliant on our majority shareholder to provide financial contributions and services to keep the company operating.  We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. We have identified below the critical accounting policies which are assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain and that are of critical importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.  On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation our financial statements.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 






	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk




	 


	As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.



	 






	Item 4. Controls and Procedures




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


	 


	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (4) management is dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31, 2017.


	 


	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
