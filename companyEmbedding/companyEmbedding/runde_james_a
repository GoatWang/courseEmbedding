James A. Runde is a Wall Street investment banker, author and corporate director specializing in strategic and financial advice. He is an Advisory Director and former Vice-Chairman of Morgan Stanley. In May 2014, Runde celebrated a rare milestone on Wall Street: 40 years as an investment banker, all at the same firm.[1] Runde is one of America's longest-serving investment bankers at a single institution, and was honored by Morgan Stanley for his length of service as well as ongoing contributions to the firm.[1] Over the course of his career, he has served as a trusted advisor to many of the world's leading companies, with a focus on the transportation and infrastructure industries.[2] Since 2006, he has been a member of the Board of Directors of The Kroger Co., one of the nation’s largest grocery retail chains. He has also served on the Board of Directors of Burlington Resources, a large U.S. oil and gas company as well as a trustee of The Morgan Library & Museum.[3]In September 2016, Runde’s debut book entitled “Unequaled: Tips for Building a Successful Career through Emotional Intelligence” was published by John C.Wiley & Sons,[4] Inc. Drawing from the author’s 40 years industry experience and adapted from his presentations to major corporations and universities, Unequaled is a guide to getting ahead and achieving professional goals, with a particular focus on soft skills or emotional intelligence. Unequaled has been featured in Harvard Business Review,[5] Bloomberg,[6] Business Insider[7] and Knowledge@Wharton.[8]In 2003, Runde was named to the Business Advisory Committee of the Northwestern University Transportation Center, a leading interdisciplinary education and research institution dedicated to the long-term improvement of domestic and international systems for the movements of materials, people, energy and information.In terms of public service, in 2007 Runde was selected to serve on a blue ribbon panel along with Speaker Newt Gingrich, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Senator Bob Kerrey to develop a national strategic plan to defeat Alzheimer's disease.[9]Contents1 Early years and education2 Career3 Recent activities4 Speeches5 Publications6 Personal life7 Awards8 References9 CitationsEarly years and educationOne of ten children, Runde grew up in Sparta, Wisconsin. Following his high school graduation, he accepted a Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship and enrolled in Marquette University in Milwaukee. In 1969, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy for five years on the nuclear energy staff of Admiral Rickover. While on active duty, he attended George Washington University School of Business and earned a master's degree in finance.[10]James Runde continues to be involved with his alma mater, and in 2000 he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Marquette.[11]CareerRunde joined Morgan Stanley in 1974 as an Associate. He was promoted through the ranks, ultimately achieving the position of Vice Chairman. While at Morgan Stanley, Runde was a protégé of the late S. Parker Gilbert. His current position with Morgan Stanley is Advisory Director.Throughout his 40-year career at Morgan Stanley, Runde is best known for his role in advising the United Parcel Service on its initial public offering in 1999.[12] He also played a key role in the privatization of Conrail and the initial public offering of China Eastern Airlines.[13] In addition to advising clients, Runde advises generations of younger investment bankers and gives his fellow bankers tactical advice on how to handle client relationships, deals and competitors.[2]Recent activitiesIn 2007, Runde was selected to serve on the Alzheimer’s Study Group, an independent, bipartisan panel created to evaluate the government’s current efforts to combat the disease. Runde served on this study group with Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Former Senator Bob Kerrey. In January 2011, President Obama signed the National Alzheimer’s Project Act ("NAPA") into law. This landmark legislation creates a national strategic plan to overcome the Alzheimer’s disease epidemic based on the recommendations of the Alzheimer’s Study Group.[14]Runde was selected to be a member of the Advisory Council of American Corporate Partners (“ACP”), a nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting veterans in their transition from the armed services to the civilian workforce. He serves on this council with General David Petraeus, Former Clinton Advisor and Senior Managing Director of Lazard Frères Vernon Jordan Jr. At The Morgan Library, Runde and his wife are financial supporters of exhibitions that are of interest to children.

Reviews
“This book is a testament to Jim Runde’s contributions to the investment banking industry and his invaluable insights and mentoring of colleagues over four decades. Runde presents an indispensable guide to those who would like to refine their performance, build and maintain client relationships, advance their careers, lead with exceptional ideas, and distinguish themselves as professionals.”
COLM KELLEHER, PRESIDENT, MORGAN STANLEY
“There could not be a better compass with which to navigate a career in any service profession than this gem of a book. This is a must-read for any young banker, lawyer, or other professional.”
THOMAS J. REID, MANAGING PARTNER, DAVIS POLK
“Jim Runde’s book answers the many questions professionals would benefit from asking but often don’t. His practical advice and clear, simple guidance on what to do, and how to behave on critical dimensions of client service are tips from which all service professionals could benefit. I wish I had read them during, not after, my 27-year career in consulting.”
NORA AUFREITER, DIRECTOR EMERITUS, MCKINSEY & COMPANY
“UnEQualed gives great practical advice for someone early in their careers and even on down the road to any CEO. Runde shares his own career experiences, both the positive and the painful, so you won’t have to learn the hard way. An essential read to achieve your personal best!”
W. RODNEY MCMULLEN, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE KROGER CO.
“Read this book. Runde makes a strong case that it takes much more than book smarts and hard work to build a successful career. Runde’s commonsense guide shares what will make all the difference in achieving excellence.”
RONALD L. SARGENT, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STAPLES, INC.

It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View James’ Full ProfileSummaryHaving graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with majors in Communication and Media Studies, Creative Writing, and Computer Sciences, I am most concerned with finding an environment where I can work hard and thrive creatively. The most important things in my life are my creative pursuits--my film projects, my garage rock band, and my writing--and I'm hoping to find a career that is a creative pursuit in itself. When engaged in such an endeavor, I have proven to be very diligent and hard-working, and I enjoy throwing myself into new projects. Ultimately, I'm looking for a work space that will allow for that kind of creative drive.ExperienceMarketing and Communications SpecialistGreat Lakes Bioenergy Research Center and Wisconsin Energy InstituteJune 2015  –  Present (2 years 2 months)I am part of the GLBRC/WEI communications team, working especially with visual media/graphic design/web development to help promote the energy research done on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Senate MessengerState of WisconsinDecember 2012  –  June 2015 (2 years 7 months)I serve as a messenger for the Senate offices, which is sort of a catch-all position.

My work encompasses graphic design, video production, photography, publication content layout, draft proofing, and computer programming. The most rewarding aspect of the job is that all of this work goes toward educating members of the public on how to make our energy systems more sustainable.Systems OperatorMandli CommunicationsMay 2012  –  August 2012 (4 months)I operated a three-camera recording system and LiDAR technology to map bridges for the company's Illinois Bridges Project.

James A. Runde

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James A. Runde is a Wall Street investment banker, author and corporate director specializing in strategic and financial advice. He is an Advisory Director and former Vice-Chairman of Morgan Stanley. In May 2014, Runde celebrated a rare milestone on Wall Street: 40 years as an investment banker, all at the same firm.[1] Runde is one of America's longest-serving investment bankers at a single institution, and was honored by Morgan Stanley for his length of service as well as ongoing contributions to the firm.[1] Over the course of his career, he has served as a trusted advisor to many of the world's leading companies, with a focus on the transportation and infrastructure industries.[2] Since 2006, he has been a member of the Board of Directors of The Kroger Co., one of the nation’s largest grocery retail chains. He has also served on the Board of Directors of Burlington Resources, a large U.S. oil and gas company as well as a trustee of The Morgan Library & Museum.[3]
In September 2016, Runde’s debut book entitled “Unequaled: Tips for Building a Successful Career through Emotional Intelligence” was published by John C.Wiley & Sons,[4] Inc. Drawing from the author’s 40 years industry experience and adapted from his presentations to major corporations and universities, Unequaled is a guide to getting ahead and achieving professional goals, with a particular focus on soft skills or emotional intelligence. Unequaled has been featured in Harvard Business Review,[5] Bloomberg,[6] Business Insider[7] and Knowledge@Wharton.[8]
In 2003, Runde was named to the Business Advisory Committee of the Northwestern University Transportation Center, a leading interdisciplinary education and research institution dedicated to the long-term improvement of domestic and international systems for the movements of materials, people, energy and information.
In terms of public service, in 2007 Runde was selected to serve on a blue ribbon panel along with Speaker Newt Gingrich, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Senator Bob Kerrey to develop a national strategic plan to defeat Alzheimer's disease.[9]

Early years and education[edit]
One of ten children, Runde grew up in Sparta, Wisconsin. Following his high school graduation, he accepted a Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) scholarship and enrolled in Marquette University in Milwaukee. In 1969, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy for five years on the nuclear energy staff of Admiral Rickover. While on active duty, he attended George Washington University School of Business and earned a master's degree in finance.[10]
James Runde continues to be involved with his alma mater, and in 2000 he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Marquette.[11]
Career[edit]
Runde joined Morgan Stanley in 1974 as an Associate. He was promoted through the ranks, ultimately achieving the position of Vice Chairman. While at Morgan Stanley, Runde was a protégé of the late S. Parker Gilbert. His current position with Morgan Stanley is Advisory Director.
Throughout his 40-year career at Morgan Stanley, Runde is best known for his role in advising the United Parcel Service on its initial public offering in 1999.[12] He also played a key role in the privatization of Conrail and the initial public offering of China Eastern Airlines.[13] In addition to advising clients, Runde advises generations of younger investment bankers and gives his fellow bankers tactical advice on how to handle client relationships, deals and competitors.[2]
Recent activities[edit]
In 2007, Runde was selected to serve on the Alzheimer’s Study Group, an independent, bipartisan panel created to evaluate the government’s current efforts to combat the disease. Runde served on this study group with Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Former Senator Bob Kerrey. In January 2011, President Obama signed the National Alzheimer’s Project Act ("NAPA") into law. This landmark legislation creates a national strategic plan to overcome the Alzheimer’s disease epidemic based on the recommendations of the Alzheimer’s Study Group.[14]
Runde was selected to be a member of the Advisory Council of American Corporate Partners (“ACP”), a nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting veterans in their transition from the armed services to the civilian workforce. He serves on this council with General David Petraeus, Former Clinton Advisor and Senior Managing Director of Lazard Frères Vernon Jordan Jr. At The Morgan Library, Runde and his wife are financial supporters of exhibitions that are of interest to children.
