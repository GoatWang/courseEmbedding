						About 
					





						“We provide our clients with bespoke advice in a private, confidential, non-conflicted manner. We do not push our clients to do what is most profitable for us, nor do we sell our clients some off-the-shelf financial product. 
					

						In my experience, many investment bankers will listen to you, but few will hear you. We have the patience and desire to hear you.“ 
					

— G. Chris Andersen




						G.C. Andersen Partners, LLC is an investment banking partnership with offices in New York and Los Angeles. The firm advises clients worldwide on mergers and acquisitions, capital raises and restructuring assignments. The firm provides advice to both publicly and privately held middle market companies with revenues between $20 million and $2 billion. 
					

						G.C. Andersen Partners believes that intellectual capital creates financial capital. We are a team of partners who have the ability to see solutions where others cannot or will not. Our partners have been involved in many notable deals across a wide spectrum of industries. The depth of our industry and transaction experience provides us access to the widest range of investors, lenders, buyers and sellers worldwide. Our independence enables us to provide conflict free advice. Our size allows us to move quickly and provide advice at levels one seldom sees at other firms. Our position in the market allows us the luxury of working only on those clients we believe in. 
					

						Transformative Solutions To Capital Problems 
					

						Our bankers have significant experience crafting financial solutions to significant and challenging transactions. We have not only the resumes and rolodexes that one expects at this level of seniority, but also the passion that creates added-value and the perspective to be able to identify patterns and connections that others may not be able to perceive. 
					


							A Hole In The Market 
						

							We are living in a time of turbulent change, putting pressure on businesses of all sizes and across all industries. The world is also changing in other fundamental ways. It is becoming smaller, flatter, faster and smarter and going from analog to digital. Naturally, the digital culture has changed many investment banks. 
						

							One of the causalities of these changes has been the role of the trusted investment banking advisor. Dramatically affected by this change is a segment critically important to G.C. Andersen Partners: middle market companies with less than $2 billion dollars of annual revenues. 
						

							The middle market is often referred to as ‘the engine of the economy’, generating a disproportionate share of GDP, patents, jobs and wealth. Historically, this segment had a core of investment banks devoted to helping middle market companies grow. In the recent past, firms like Alex Brown, Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson Stephens covered this market and enabled many middle market companies to reach their fullest potential, often through stunning combinations of creativity, innovation and a belief in clients that was almost messianic. These firms are gone, having either consolidated or disappeared altogether. The remaining firms serving the middle market that have appeared in their place are apparently often consigned to developing their brands and businesses one deal at a time and flogging themselves on blogs, chat rooms and conference rooms. They are small and they seem even smaller, without world class perspective, market proven results or “client-first” commitment. 
						

							Modern business is a series of complex equations and hourly real-time challenges. There are more choices, more regulations and more public opinion to consider. There are fewer brand names which bring certainty of success, while many are grappling with a mountain of conflicting data and opinions. The large firms with multiple lines of business, often overlapping with client interests and goals, make for an environment where conflicts can occur. Clients are increasingly fearful and apprehensive about their investment banker given the myriad of not so transparent conflicts that seem to plague large diversified investment banking firms. 
						

							We believe “client first” commitment and world class access to capital coupled with innovative thinking can enable solutions to complex issue of corporate capital and drive growth and development. 
						

							Rethinking Investment Banking. 
						

							G.C. Andersen Partners proposes that investment banking return to its roots as counselors and advisors to corporate decision makers at the highest levels of commerce. We are focused on providing thoughtful advice over the long-term, assisting management drive corporate growth and societal value. 
						

							Our mission is to create opportunity through an application of proven innovation and tenacious execution. In selecting G.C. Andersen Partners as their financial advisor, our clients know that they have hired investment banking professionals who are on their side, putting their needs first.

WALL STREET'S NEW INVENTOR CLASS


By FRED R. BLEAKLEY


Published: January 13, 1985









                    EXCEPT for a handful of financial mavericks such as the legendary Sidney Weinberg, Robert Lehman and Andre Meyer, Wall Street investment bankers were for years wedded to long-term fixed-rate bonds, straight common stock, and a handful of other financial standbys.        

                    Not anymore. Nowadays, there's a proliferation of innovative deals, and a new breed of investment bankers to dream them up. ''There is a special class of investment bankers whose job is to perceive change and exploit it,'' says Prof. Samuel Hayes of the Harvard Business School.        

                    Typically in their 30's, with several years of experience in specialized areas of the capital markets, they are innovating across the whole spectrum of finance. They hold titles such as director of new product development, and they command salaries that, while not approaching the multimillion-dollar checks that flow to Wall Street's top traders, are far into the six-digit figures. They rely heavily on computers to design new types of securities. And they keep tabs on what competitors offer so that they can add new features to a popular bond.        

                    The innovators are stoking the fires of a competitive battle among investment bankers. No longer can the firms count on repeat business. Ever since 1979, when the Federal Reserve Board decided to let interest rates fluctuate more sharply, corporations have been increasingly willing to embrace any deal - and any investment banking firm - that attracts investors away from short-term money market instruments.        

                    Virtually every firm now has a new product think tank. Last summer, Shearson Lehman/American Express formally set up a ''New Product Development Group.'' And a few months ago Paine Webber hired a vice president from Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company to head a ''New Products Group.''        

                    Such units have been prolific. Ten years ago, David M. Darst's ''The Complete Bond Book'' described 65 fixed-income instruments. This fall, Mr. Darst counted no less than 270 alternative financing methods.        

                    Most of the new deals, however, are variations on old themes. They are blends of features - yields, convertability, cost and the like - that have proved popular with investors. According to Mr. Darst, with a bit more initiative - and a lot more use of computers - the product developers could devise deals that pinpoint even better mixes of old features. ''Just a little bit of artificial intelligence programming would give them the ability to analyze which elements of a deal are most popular,'' he said.        

                    He also notes that the product developers seem to pay little attention to the blends of features that have proved appealing overseas, or in the tax-exempt municipal market. ''There are a lot of unique muni deals, but the taxable new product guys are like yuppies who will pass by a flea market and miss a bargain,'' he said.        

                    Even if they are just scratching the surface, new product developers are a powerful force in the financial world. The following four men have been responsible for a number of the market's new deals and are typical of this new breed of investment banker.  G. Chris Andersen        

                    Drexel Burnham Lambert        

                    DUE to a learning disability, G. Chris Andersen, a 46-year-old managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert, is by his own admission ''a tremendously poor reader'' who literally doesn't know his left hand from his right. He also is, by all accounts, one of the most creative investment bankers on Wall Street.        

                    Among his inventions are a Sunshine Mining Company bond issued in 1980 in which principal at maturity would be the higher price of either $1,000 or 50 ounces of silver, a bevy of variations in the ''junk'' (high yield) bond market, and last month's unusual initial public offering of the Arley Merchandise Corporation.        

                    ''If Chris is one of four investment bankers in a room, the other three may come up with one usable idea each. Chris will have seven,'' said Fred Joseph, head of investment banking at Drexel Burnham.        

                    Mr. Andersen firmly believes in financial alchemy - that debt issues can be made to take on equity characteristics and vice versa. It was the combination of equity with debt that enabled Arley to go public (see box). Mr. Andersen said he could have added even more bells and whistles to the offering if the company had agreed. ''It could have been my ultimate gee whiz,'' he sighs.        

                    His penchant for innovation stems in part from the ''liberal eduation'' he received as an ''Army brat'' who lived in 38 states and 12 countries before the age of 18. ''You learn to keep an open mind,'' Mr. Andersen said. Part of his education, he added, was running with London street gangs in the mid-1950's. He toyed with the idea of becoming a boxer until a Detroit street gang taught him he wasn't as tough as he thought.        

                    Despite his learning disability, Mr. Andersen won academic scholarships to the University of Colorado and to Northwestern University's Graduate School of Business. What he calls ''an audio driven memory'' gives him near-perfect recall of numbers and facts once he hears them. ''I guess I have a data base that is different from that of most people,'' he says.

Trustee SungEun Han-Andersen
Member: Campaign Executive Committee, and International Advisory Board
Co-chair: Campaign Kickoff
Campaign volunteer SungEun Han-Andersen (CFA’85) has lived in many worlds, both geographically and professionally.
She grew up in Seoul, South Korea, where—as a child piano prodigy—she attended music schools. She moved with her family to the New York area in 1979, when she was a junior in high school, to attend the Julliard School’s pre-college program. After spending a summer at BU’s Tanglewood Institute, she decided to enroll at BU’s College of Fine Arts. “I loved the Boston area,” she recalls. “When I was young, I saw the movie Love Story. I had pretty romantic ideas about Boston!”
Originally a composition major, Han-Andersen surprised everyone—including herself—by winning a piano competition as a freshman. She became a performance major, spending many hours in CFA’s basement practice rooms. “Half my waking hours,” she recalls. “I was very disciplined, but those practice rooms were terrible.”
A balanced life
After graduating from BU, Han-Andersen enrolled in a doctoral program at the Manhattan School of Music. Gradually, though, she began worrying that her life was too narrow. First taking a research job with Price Waterhouse in London—and not telling her parents for two years that she had stepped off the performance track—she discovered the world of management consulting. “It was a freeing experience,” she says of that momentous change. “I got to have a more balanced life.”
That trend continued after she married investment banker G. Chris Andersen, who encouraged her to give up her five-day-a-week consultant’s travel schedule to manage a new family foundation. Two of the foundation’s major gifts harked back to an earlier phase of Han-Andersen’s life: grants to both the College of Fine Arts and the Manhattan School of Music to build state-of-the-art practice rooms for their students.
“So many BU alumni are grateful for the education they received there, and so many want to be reconnected with the University.” —SungEun Han-Andersen
Han-Andersen has also given freely of her time to Boston University. Elected a trustee of the University in 2007, she sits on BU’s International Advisory Board (IAB) and has helped launch The Campaign for Boston University both in Boston and at the recent Dubai international kickoff. “Dubai was an amazing experience,” she says, “especially the IAB sessions. How often do you get to meet the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, get driven around in a sensor-driven car without a driver, and then have dinner out in the desert under the stars?”
Han-Andersen officially retired from the concert circuit last year, giving her more time to devote to new artistic pursuits and to the family’s 250-acre farm dedicated to training and boarding horses. “That also closes a circle for me,” she explains. “My BU piano teacher, Maria Clodes Jaguaribe, had a horse at her home. She would take me home before recitals and let me groom the horse, which I found very relaxing. I started to ride in London, and I’ve been working with horses ever since. I love them.”
Person by person
Is she surprised at the success of BU’s campaign to date? “No,” she says. “Not at all. So many BU alumni are grateful for the education they received there, and so many want to be reconnected with the University. That’s how we will succeed: person by person.”

Ham-Fisted: Banker Forks Over Big Dough for Perfect Pig

G. Chris Andersen is in the premier league of Wall Street investment bankers and financial magicians, having crafted intricate, breathtaking transactions for major companies around the world. He is known for unknotting complex economic situations and digging hard for the next big thing in the most unusual places.

That leads us to pigs.
Andersen may also be on track to enter the elite ranks of pig farmers in a country that has taken locavore sensibility to a new level. But that does not mean his financial model is even rational at this point. Andersen’s wife, Sung, has told him that she would not cotton to his pigs dragging them squealing into bankruptcy.
Let’s start at the beginning. Andersen founded G.C. Andersen Partners, an investment banking firm with offices on Park Avenue and in Los Angeles, after years of deals at Paine Webber and Drexel Burnham Lambert. He also founded Møsefund Farm in the northwestern corner of New Jersey, its beautiful landscape intended as a gentleman farmer’s weekend retreat and horse boarding and training center, with Sung managing the horse side of things. None of this is out of the ordinary for a man of means, and things likely would have continued on their usual, leisurely course, except for the U.S. government.
You see, Andersen had tasted jamón ibérico, the paper-thin slices of Spanish aged ham found in the tapas bars of Barcelona, and was captivated, addicted and unable to find it in New York City. “I can get anything in New York,” he says indignantly, “but not jamón, thanks to the then import restrictions by the USDA.” Like most things that get Andersen’s attention, this began a quest. “I can raise a pig, I can make this stuff,” was the mantra. With the help of his chef, Peter Lambert, Pig 1.0 was born and raised — a Yorkshire Long, the standard-grade commodity pig we know in the U.S. Except: this one ate chestnut flour and goat’s milk. “The result was better than a factory-raised pig but not what I was looking for,” says Andersen.From our partners at VICE

Pig 2.0 was Berkshire stock. Although Sung thought it was a great-looking hog, she effectively ran Andersen and his experiment off the farm, as the new stock of pigs was disrupting the serenity of her horses. He moved the pigs up the road to a smaller piece of land he owned, rebuilt the barn as a piggery and continued the quest. “Two-point-oh was better, but still not enough pigginess to the pig.”
‘Pig 2.0 was better, but still not enough pigginess to the pig.’
More experimentation, more capital costs, with Andersen purchasing tools for the local golf club groundskeepers to gather acorns for his pigs. This begins to sound like a very sensible investment banker taking very unsound financial steps to get his own personal stash of ham. “As an economic model it was absolutely insane,” he says. Having known Andersen for some 25 years, I would parse this to be his intellectual love of the hunt. He is after a solution, not just the meat. This is, in fact, his natural drive to closing a deal.
Sometime during 2007 Andersen’s then-new chef, Michael Clampffer, heard about the Mangalitsa pig. The Mangalitsa is a heritage animal, raised by the imperial Hapsburgs in Hungary in the 1830s, cultured on the stock of German wild boar. It is obese, marbled with fat and, from all accounts, results in pork so good it sings like filet mignon in your mouth. One variation Møsefund now raises is called a Swallow Belly, sporting long, curly hair and black toenails. The key here is that the Iberian black-footed pig, source of the coveted Spanish jamón, is a descendent of the European wild boar, with the Mangalitsa being the other branch of the family tree. So Andersen was on target as far as evolution was concerned. We are now at Pig 3.0.
Pig 3.0 had some hands-on attention. Andersen did a pig tour of Spain, meeting his iconic animal face-to-face. He ate acorns in the forest with them and saw them eat 15 pounds of nuts a day.
Pig 3.0 had some hands-on attention. Andersen did a pig tour of Spain, meeting his iconic animal face-to-face. He ate acorns in the forest with them and saw them eat 15 pounds of nuts a day. “They literally pig out,” he says, not so tongue-in-cheek. Back at Møsefund Farm, he and Michael set to fine-tuning the feeding of his drove of 3.0s, adding barley to the mix of acorns, the magic ingredient in the feed for Kobe beef. In 2010 Møsefund was producing something very different, according to Andersen: “Better tasting, the better-for-you red meat.” The Mangalitsa has the highest concentration of monounsaturated fat of any domesticated animal, which led Auburn University to conduct studies on the Mangalitsa, looking for keys to defeating diabetes and heart disease in humans. This too is a serious part of the equation for Andersen, a humanly beneficial piece in the entire puzzle of his quest.
But the economics are still problematic, and the entire history of American agriculture comes to play. Andersen needs to sell the whole pig, in spite of the good prices for his collars, chops and bacon he gets from Manhattan restaurants, to make sound economic sense of the process. Ham, the starting point of this quest, is the hang-up. “It takes four years to build a Mangalitsa ham,” he says, “and the big issue in the end is one for all artisanal farmers. You need to slaughter the pig in the right way.” But the right way is not readily available due to the large, consolidated slaughterhouses and their needy corporate clients.
The Mangalitsa needs to be scalded, its long hair taken off, not skinned like factory pork. With less than 2,000 animals and maybe 15 at a time ready for slaughter, the only slaughterhouse he has found where it can be properly killed, cut and cured is in Missouri — a hike from the New Jersey farm. To date, the economics do not balance.
Andersen carries on his cell phone a photograph of a Møsefund Mangalitsa chop. He is erudite about the history, the facts of pig farming, proud of it and not without a sense of humor about a Wall Street guy, not a farmer, coming into the country. He has formed the Mangalitsa Breeders Association and sits as its first chairman. When I ask about the irony of starting down the labyrinthian path to jamón and then not being able to get a ham out of the deal I also state the obvious — that he must have had at least one ham from 3.0. “I have had a ham or two made for myself,” he replies.
And?
“Pretty goddamn good.”

Energy Efficient Replacement Windows: Affordable Windows, Projects and Options
By Nicole Seaton

					One of the smartest and cost-effective ways to save money on your monthly bills is to replace the windows in your home. Compared to other expensive and time-consuming home improvements, window replacement is an upgrade that can help retain the heat in your home and greatly minimize your heating bill. If you live in an older residence, you might have single-pane windows that do not have today's innovative technology that keeps the cold out and the warmth inside. In the summer months, modern windows perform the opposite function: some even have special protection against ultraviolet rays, deflecting the sun on the hottest summer days.
				










Double the pane equals financial gain

					The first consideration in upgrading your windows is, "Single or double-pane?" Although single-pane windows are less expensive, double pane windows offer added protection from the heat and cold, and they also protect your home from dust, debris and pests. You might think that you're saving money by purchasing cheap windows, but if you spend a little more, you'll see an instant return on your investment: when you open your next power bill! High-quality, modern double pane windows should adhere to industry standards set by the National Fenestration Rating Council. If your windows have an NFRC label, you can be sure they are high-quality windows that can last for generations.
				

					Windows with multiple panes can be filled with gases like krypton and argon, which helps reduce heat loss and increases R-values, or resistance to heat loss. The higher the R-value, the better your new windows can protect against heat loss. Another factor to consider is the window's U-value, or its resistance to heat transfer. When researching window options, both R-value and U-value information should be available for the entire window: some manufacturers only offer this information for the middle of the window.
				

					There are many styles of modern windows to choose from, but not every option may fit your budget. Some options companies offer don't necessarily make a difference in savings. For instance, window companies might try to talk you into double pane windows with more than one inch between the windows. While this space between the windows creates better insulation, more than an inch does not make for more energy efficient windows- it's actually wasted space.
				










Window companies and installers: get multiple estimates before buying

					Now is a great time to find affordable windows that meet your budget. Many window companies will come directly to your home to show you the different kinds of replacement windows and window materials. It's a good idea to get more than one estimate: some companies have seasonal sales or special incentives for first-time customers. By shopping around, you'll be able to find energy efficient, affordable windows.
				

					Whether you are hiring a professional contractor to install your new windows or you're armed with do-it-yourself know-how, the more research you do, the better prepared you will be to choose the best windows for your location, time frame and budget. The effects of new home windows are immediate: they increase the value and aesthetic appeal of your home while efficiently maintaining a comfortable temperature. By making this simple and cost-effective improvement to your home, you will reap the visual and financial rewards for years to come.
