Cash and Short Duration



PIMCO's short duration strategies seek to provide liquidity, principal preservation and consistent income by investing in money market and other short maturity fixed income securities. These strategies benefit from unique economic forecasting, close monitoring of the Federal Reserve and fixed income expertise.

Euro Liquidity StrategyEuro Short Term StrategyGovernment Money Market StrategyLow Duration StrategyU.K. Sterling Low Average Duration Strategy

Bonds offer investors the potential for regular income, preservation of capital, portfolio diversification and a hedge against an economic slowdown. The range of issuers in the world's largest securities markets offers opportunities for a broad spectrum of investors.

Equity



Equity strategies offer the potential for attractive long-term returns relative to other asset classes as well as a high level of liquidity. While historically more volatile than investments in fixed income, investments in stocks often serve as core holdings in balanced portfolios for many types of investors.

Real Assets



​Strategies that employ real assets aim to have either an explicit or implicit return correlation to inflation. Real assets include inflation-linked bonds, commodities and real estate or some combination of those assets. This can potentially enhance portfolio diversification, mitigate inflation risk and provide more stable real (after-inflation) returns.

Commodities-Based StrategiesGlobal Real Return Strategies




Currency



Currency strategies can provide efficient and risk-aware portfolio diversification while targeting opportunities to exploit structural inefficiencies and valuation misalignments in global currency markets. They can offer exposure to select developed and developing economies where favorable economic fundamentals indicate a potential for currency appreciation.

​Emerging Markets Currency StrategyFX Strategy




Asset Allocation



PIMCO's asset allocation strategies employ our proven investment process to create portfolios positioned in key global risk factors within traditional and alternative asset classes. These strategies seek attractive risk adjusted returns and true portfolio diversification utilizing dynamic multi asset and risk factor solutions. These approaches may also employ a tail risk hedging program to help protect against systemic market shocks.

Global Multi-Asset Strategy

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.
