Tub & Shower Parts

 3,771 Tub and Shower Parts
Installing a new shower or bathtub/shower combo is a great way to update your bathroom, plus it can make your home spa feel that much more luxurious. If you’re in the process of updating or need to install a whole new shower or bathtub, you may find your project requires new  shower fixtures, as well. Certain items like the shower valve or diverter may not be as fun to pick out, but you can add a touch of style by hand picking the visible pieces of your shower or bathtub’s plumbing. More

History
Keller Williams Capital Properties was founded in 2006 by Bo Menkiti, Brandon Green, Carlos Garcia, Jason Martin, and Joel Nelson who envisioned a real estate brokerage founded upon a culture of collaboration and mutual success. They chose the Keller Williams platform because of its culture of service and unique focus on education, technology, and wealth-building. Capital Properties is a portfolio company within the Menkiti Group family of companies and is operated by the Menkiti Group.







Bo Menkiti, Chief Executive Officer
Bo Menkiti serves as the Founder and CEO of Keller Williams Capital Properties. He is also the CEO of The Menkiti Group, a real estate services firm focused on strengthening neighborhoods through the strategic development, management, and sale of real estate in urban markets. The Menkiti Group operates Keller Williams Capital Properties.
Prior to forming Keller Williams Capital Properties and The Menkiti Group, Bo served as Chief Operating Officer of College Summit, a national non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the college enrollment rate of low-income students. In this capacity, Bo oversaw the organization’s successful growth into a multi-site national organization.
Bo’s work has been featured in David Bornstein’s book on social entrepreneurs How to Change the World, and in Stephen Goldsmith’s The Power of Social Innovation. He has been recognized nationally by Ebony and Inc. Magazine as one of the coolest young entrepreneurs in America, and was awarded The National Association of Realtors Prestigious “30 under 30” award in 2006. Bo was also honored as Minority Business Leader by the Washington Business Journal and by the National Association of Realtors as the District of Columbia Realtor of the Year in 2014.
In 2015, Keller Williams Realty honored Bo Menkiti as the 2015 ‘Entrepreneur of the Year.’ Bo was also recognized by the Washington Business Journal as a 40 under 40 honoree.

He is a current board member for City First Bank of DC and Dance Place, and serves as a member of the Steering Committee of the Small Business Policy Project.

In 2004 he founded Brandon Green Residential, a nationally ranked sales team responsible for selling hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate across the Washington, D.C. area.
In 2006, Brandon co-founded the Keller Williams Capital Properties brokerage as Principal Broker along with CEO Bo Menkiti and partners Carlos Garcia, Jason Martin and Joel Nelson. Brandon became Managing Director of Capital Properties’ flagship D.C. office in 2011, which he managed until the fall of 2014 when he assumed the role of Managing Partner for the entire organization. Under Brandon’s leadership the Washington, D.C. office seized the No. 1 slot in office unit market share in Washington, D.C. and has been widely praised for its productivity and unique culture.
Brandon is an expert in the local real estate market, is a nationally top-listed real estate executive, and an industry leader across North America.
