                              This report presents hydrographic and chemical data from the eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean collected in January 1977
                                 aboard Oregon State University's (OSU) R/V WECOMA during Leg I of Cruise WELOC 77. The purpose of the cruise, WELOC-77-I,
                                 was to investigate the distributions of dissolved nitrous oxide and molecular hydrogen in an oceanic environment characterized
                                 by an extensive oxygen minimum layer which is thought to be the major denitrification site in the world ocean. Accordingly,
                                 the research effort was concentrated on studying the distributions of variables at stations located around the core of the
                                 oxygen minimum

Company Overview




Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, chronic, and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.
The Company's lead product candidate, anabasum (aka JBT-101 or Resunab), is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug designed to resolve chronic inflammation and fibrotic processes. Anabasum has demonstrated positive results in two Phase 2 studies, one in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and one in cystic fibrosis. Additionally, anabasum is being evaluated in a 12-month open-label extension study in systemic sclerosis, a Phase 2 study in skin-predominant dermatomyositis with a 12-month open-label extension, and soon in another Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus.
Corbus plans to commence a Phase 3 study to support a New Drug Application (NDA) of anabasum for the treatment of systemic sclerosis in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company is also planning to initiate a second larger and longer Phase 2b study of anabasum for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in the fourth quarter of 2017.
