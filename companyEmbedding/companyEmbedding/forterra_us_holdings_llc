(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Report as well as the disclosure and audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017, or the 2016 10-K.  This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with those statements.  Overview  Our Company  We are a leading manufacturer of pipe and precast products by sales volume in the United States and Eastern Canada for a variety of water-related infrastructure applications, including water transmission, distribution and drainage. We provide critical infrastructure components for a broad spectrum of construction projects across residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. Our extensive suite of end-to-end products covers "the First Mile to the Last Mile" of the water infrastructure grid, ranging from large diameter pipe that transports water to and from treatment centers and manages drainage along major transportation corridors, to smaller diameter pipe that delivers potable water to, and removes wastewater from, end users in residential and commercial settings. We employ a specialized technical salesforce, including engineers and field service representatives, which enables us to deliver a high degree of customer service, create tailored solutions and ensure our products meet project specifications to maximize applications in the field. We believe that our product breadth, footprint in the United States and Eastern Canada and significant scale help make us a one-stop shop for water-related pipe and products, and a preferred supplier to a wide variety of customers, including contractors, distributors and municipalities.  Our Segments  Our operations are organized into the following reportable segments, which is the way   Drainage Pipe & Products - We are a producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products in the United States and Eastern Canada.   Water Pipe & Products - We are a producer of ductile iron pipe (DIP) and concrete and steel pressure pipe.   Corporate and Other - Consists of corporate overhead locations in the United States, and our roof tile operations which were sold in April 2016.  Basis of Presentation  Historical Results of Operations  Lone Star, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired our business, along with the business of Forterra, plc, the operator the former building products business of HeidelbergCement in the United Kingdom, or Forterra UK, on March 13, 2015 from HeidelbergCement, or the Acquisition for aggregate cash consideration of $1.33 billion, subject to a $100.0 million earn-out that is currently subject to dispute, as discussed in greater detail in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Prior to the Acquisition, we were  HeidelbergCement's building products operations in the United States and Eastern Canada. LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd, or LSF9 was formed on February 6, 2015 for the purpose of consummating the Acquisition and had no operations prior to the date of Acquisition.  Prior to our initial public offering of common stock on October 25, 2016, or the Offering, LSF9 Concrete Holdings Ltd, or LSF9, transferred its building products operations in the United States and Eastern Canada to Forterra, Inc. in an internal reorganization transaction, or the Reorganization. Forterra, Inc. was formed on June 21, 2016 for purposes of the Reorganization and did not have any operations prior to the date of the Reorganization.  Unless otherwise specified or where the context otherwise requires, references in this Report to "our," "we," "us," "Forterra", the "Company" and "our business" (i) for periods prior to the Reorganization refer to the building products business of LSF9 in the United States and Eastern Canada and (ii) for periods following the Reorganization refer to the operations of Forterra, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  Recent Developments  Royal Acquisition  On February 3, 2017, we acquired Royal Enterprises America, Inc., or Royal, for aggregate consideration of $35.3 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Royal manufactures concrete drainage pipe, precast concrete products, stormwater treatment technologies and erosion control products serving the greater Minneapolis market. The acquisition was financed with borrowings on our asset based revolver entered into in connection with the IPO, or the 2016 Revolver.  Reorganization  Prior to the consummation of the IPO, LSF9 distributed its brick operations in the United States and Eastern Canada to an affiliate of Lone Star, the Bricks Disposition, which was recognized as a return of capital in the statement of shareholders' equity. We reclassified the operations of our former brick business to discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Following the Bricks Disposition and prior to the consummation of the IPO, the remaining building products operations of LSF9 in the United States and Eastern Canada were transferred to Forterra, Inc. in the Reorganization. Following the Reorganization, Forterra, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Forterra US Holdings, LLC, which is indirectly wholly owned by an affiliate of Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P., or Lone Star.  The IPO  On October 25, 2016, we completed the IPO, in which we offered and sold 18,420,000 shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds from the IPO of $313.3 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and before payment of IPO expenses, $296.0 million of which were used to repay indebtedness in the refinancing transactions summarized below.  Refinancing  Concurrent with the completion of the IPO, the Company entered into new credit facilities, or the Refinancing. In the Refinancing, the Company entered into the 2016 Revolver, a new $300.0 million asset based revolving credit facility, for working capital and general corporate purposes and a new $1.05 billion senior term loan facility, or the 2016 Senior Term Loan, the proceeds of which, together with a $125.0 million draw on the 2016 Revolver and the proceeds from the IPO, were used to repay in full and terminate the then-existing Junior Term Loan of $260.0 million, or the Junior Term Loan, the 2015 Senior Term Loan of $1.04 billion, and the existing balance under the 2015 Revolver, in addition to related expenses associated with the IPO and Refinancing. Immediately subsequent to the completion of the IPO, Forterra had $125.0 million outstanding on its 2016 Revolver and $1.05 billion on its 2016 Senior Term Loan. The $260.0 million repayment toward the Junior Term Loan represented a full repayment of the outstanding principal on that loan, resulting in a related write-off of issue  discounts and capitalized issuance costs of approximately $22.4 million. The repayment also triggered a prepayment penalty of approximately $7.8 million.  Tax receivable agreement  In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement with Lone Star that provides for, among other things, the payment by the Company to Lone Star of 85% of the amount of certain covered tax benefits, which may reduce the actual liability for certain taxes that the Company might otherwise be required to pay. The tax receivable agreement is summarized in greater detail in note 14, Commitments and contingencies, to the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations  Our financial performance and results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including conditions in the residential, and non-residential and infrastructure construction markets, general economic conditions, changes in cost of goods sold, and seasonality and weather conditions. Some of the more important factors are discussed in the 2016 10-K, to which there were no material changes during period covered by this report.  Factors Affecting our Financial Statements Business Combinations The Company completed the following transactions impacting the periods presented: Purchase Price Acquisitions: (in millions) 2015 Cretex Concrete Products, Inc. $ 245.1 2016 Sherman-Dixie Concrete Industries 66.8 USP Holdings, Inc. 778.7 Bio Clean Environmental Services, Inc. and Modular Wetland Systems, Inc. 30.6 J&G Concrete Operations, LLC 32.4 Precast Concepts, LLC 99.6 2017 Royal 35.3  Royal Acquisition - On February 3, 2017, Forterra acquired Royal for aggregate consideration of $35.3 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Royal manufactures concrete drainage pipe, precast concrete products, stormwater treatment technologies and erosion control products serving the greater Minneapolis market. Royal operates as part of the Company's Drainage Pipe & Products reportable segment. The acquisition was financed with borrowings on the 2016 Revolver.  Sale Leaseback - On April 5, 2016, the Company sold properties in 47 sites throughout the U.S. and Canada to Pipe Portfolio Owner (Multi) LP, or the U.S. Buyer, and FORT-BEN Holdings (ONQC) Ltd., or the Canadian Buyer, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $204.3 million. On April 14, 2016, the Company sold additional properties in two sites located in the U.S. to the U.S. Buyer for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.9 million. In connection with these transactions, the Company and U.S. Buyer and an affiliate of the Canadian Buyer entered into master land and building lease agreements under which the Company  agreed to lease back each of the properties for an initial term of twenty years, followed by one optional renewal term of 9 years, 11 months. Leaseback rental will escalate annually by 2% during the initial term and based on changes in the Consumer Price Index capped at 4% during the optional renewal period. The proceeds received from the sale-leaseback transactions net of transaction costs of $6.5 million amounted to $209.7 million.  Prior to the Reorganization, the sale-leaseback transactions were considered to have one form of prohibited "continuing involvement" at the inception of the lease which preclude sale-leaseback accounting for transactions involving real estate in the financial statements of the Company because a guarantee by LSF9 provided the buyer-lessor or the lessor, as applicable, with additional collateral that reduced the buyer-lessor's or the lessor's, as applicable, risk of loss. As a result, the assets subject to the sale-leaseback remained on the balance sheet and were depreciated. Additionally, the aggregate proceeds were recorded as a financing obligation in the consolidated balance sheet and under financing in the statements of cash flow. In October 2016, the Company entered into agreements to replace the guarantor, then LSF9, with Forterra, Inc. as the new guarantor, effective immediately following completion of the Reorganization. Due to the change in guarantor, the sale leaseback qualified for sales recognition and was classified as an operating lease beginning October 2016. Associated with the sale, in October 2016, the Company recognized a loss on the statement of operations of $19.6 million and a deferred gain of $81.5 million. The deferred gain will be amortized over the life of the lease. As of March 31, 2017, the non-current portion of the deferred gain was $77.6 million and the current portion of the deferred gain was $2.8 million in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.  Principal Components of Results of Operations  Net Sales  Net sales consist of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of products in the ordinary course of business and include the billable costs of delivery of our products to customers, net of discounts given to the customer. Net sales include any outbound freight charged to the customer. Revenue for certain contracts related to our structural precast and products that are designed and engineered specifically for the customer is recognized under the percentage-of-completion method. Certain of our businesses, primarily our concrete and steel pressure pipe businesses, also enter into agreements to provide inventory to customers for long-term construction projects. With respect to these agreements, we recognize revenue upon shipment of the respective goods, whereas billings are based on contract terms and may or may not coincide with shipments, which gives rise to either unbilled or deferred revenue.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold includes raw materials (cement, aggregates, scrap, and steel) and supplies, labor (including contract labor), freight (including outbound freight for delivery of products to end users and other charges such as inbound freight), energy, depreciation and amortization, repairs and maintenance and other cost of goods sold.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses include expenses for sales, marketing, legal, accounting and finance services, human resources, customer support, treasury and other general corporate services. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include transaction costs directly related to the business combinations and other costs incurred to initiate cost savings initiatives.  Earnings from Equity Method Investee  Earnings from equity method investee represents our share of the income of the Concrete Pipe & Precast LLC, or CP&P, joint venture we entered into in July 2012 with Americast, Inc. We contributed plant assets and related inventory from nine plants as part of the agreement to form CP&P in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. CP&P is engaged primarily in the manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of concrete pipe and precast products in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, with sales to contiguous states.  Gain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net  Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment, net includes the net gain or loss on the sale of assets including property, plant and equipment.  Other Operating Income  The remaining categories of operating income and expenses consist of scrap income (associated with scrap from the manufacturing process or remaining scrap after plants are closed), insurance gains, rental income and income generated from exhausted clay quarries that are used for landfill.  Interest Expense  Interest expense represents interest on indebtedness.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense consists of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign taxes based on income in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 as Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Total Company The following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016. Also included is information relating to the operating results as a percentage of net sales. For the three For the three months % of months end March % of Statements of Income Data: end March 31, 2017 Net Sales 31, 2016 Net Sales Net sales $ 338,302 100.0 % 186,996 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 299,335 88.5 % 151,305 80.9 % Gross profit 38,967 11.5 % 35,691 19.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (65,301 ) 19.3 % (33,661 ) 18.0 % Impairment and exit charges (435 ) 0.1 % - - % Earnings from equity method investee 3,171 0.9 % 1,303 0.7 % Loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, net (774 ) 0.2 % 2 - % Other operating income 2,007 0.6 % 1,226 0.7 % (61,332 ) 18.1 % (31,130 ) 16.6 % Income (loss) from operations (22,365 ) 6.6 % 4,561 2.4 % Other income (expenses) Interest expense (13,542 ) 4.0 % (17,290 ) 9.2 % Loss before income taxes (35,907 ) 10.6 % (12,729 ) 6.8 % Income tax benefit 13,364 4.0 % 10,567 5.7 % Net loss $ (22,543 ) 6.7 % (2,162 ) 1.2 %  Net Sales  Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $338.3 million, an increase of $151.3 million or 81.0% from $187.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The period-over-period increase was primarily attributable to additional net sales provided by the Company's acquisitions, consisting of net sales attributable to U.S. Pipe of $142.9 million, Precast Concepts of $11.4 million, Bio Clean of $5.0 million, J&G of $2.4 million, and Royal of $1.3 million. The increased net sales provided by acquisitions was partially offset by a decline in net sales in legacy businesses of approximately $11.7 million due to pricing pressures and project delays due to weather.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold were $299.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $148.0 million or 97.8% from $151.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The period-over-period increase was primarily attributable to the acquired companies mentioned above which increased cost of good sold by $132.6 million, inclusive of $1.4 million of inventory step-up adjustments primarily related to the Precast Concepts and Royal acquisitions. Costs of goods sold in the legacy business increased by $15.4 million primarily as a result increases in freight and labor costs.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased by $3.3 million, or 9.1%, to $39.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $35.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Gross profit increased due to the impact of the acquisitions offset by the other factors impacting cost of goods sold described above.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $65.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $31.6 million or 93.8% from $33.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The period-over-period increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $26.2 million of costs from acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the legacy business increased by $5.4 million primarily as a result of additional consulting costs and increased corporate headcount.  Interest Expense  Interest expense decreased by $3.8 million, or 22.0%, to $13.5 million in the three months ended March 31. 2017 from $17.3 million in the three months ended March 31. 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the Junior Term Loan in connection with the IPO and the lower effective interest rates in the 2017 period under the 2016 Revolver and 2016 Senior Term Loan as compared to the 2016 period under the 2015 Revolver and the 2015 Senior Term Loan.  Income Tax Benefit  Income tax benefit increased by $2.8 million, or 26.4%, to $13.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 207 from $10.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016 due to an increase in the loss between periods.  Net Income (Loss)  The net loss of $22.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $20.3 million or 922.7% as compared to a net loss of $2.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016, was driven by lower increases in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative costs, each as a percentage of net sales, as compared to the prior year period.  Segment For the three months ended March 31, 2017: Drainage Pipe & Water Pipe & Products Products Corporate and Other Total (In thousands) Net sales $ 160,448 $ 177,849 $ 5 $ 338,302 Gross profit (loss) 17,377 22,155 (565 ) 38,967 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (961 ) (335 ) (34,611 ) (35,907 )  For the three months ended March 31, 2016:   Drainage Pipe Water Pipe & Corporate and & Products Products Other Total (In thousands) Net sales $ 144,321 $ 40,471 $ 2,204 $ 186,996 Gross profit (loss) 30,545 6,033 (887 ) 35,691 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 18,479 2,590 (33,798 ) (12,729 )  For the purposes of evaluating segment performance, the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a basis for making the decisions to allocate resources and assess performance. Our discussion below includes the primary drivers of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Drainage Pipe & Products  Net Sales  Net sales increased by $16.1 million, or 11.2%, to $160.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $144.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to net sales attributable to Precast Concepts of $11.4 million, Bio Clean of $5.0 million, J&G of $2.4 million, and Royal of $1.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase was a reduction in net sales from the legacy business of $4.0 million as compared to the prior year period. The decline in legacy net sales of approximately 2.3% was primarily due to the impact of poor weather causing delays in projects in addition to pricing pressures in our Houston market, partially offset by growth in other key markets, including North Texas.  Gross Profit  Gross profit was $17.4 million in the three months ended March 31 ,2017, a decrease of $13.1 million or 43.0% from $30.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower average sales prices in Houston, higher cost of goods sold including labor, freight, raw materials, and rent expense, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.  Water Pipe & Products  Net Sales  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net sales were $177.8 million, an increase of $137.3 million or 339.0% from $40.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to net sales from U.S. Pipe of $142.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in legacy net sales of $5.5 million primarily due to lower sales volumes.  Gross Profit  Gross profit was $22.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $16.2 million or 270.0% from $6.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to the U.S. Pipe acquisition, and partially offset by a decrease in legacy gross profit. Gross profit also benefited in the prior year period from a large, higher margin project in Canada that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The legacy concrete and steel pressure pipe business was also negatively impacted during first quarter of 2017 by customer and weather driven delays in certain projects.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations and borrowings under our credit agreements. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations and capital expenditures in the next 24 months.  We are currently engaged in a dispute with HeidelbergCement regarding the earn-out provision in the purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Acquisition. HeidelbergCement has asserted that a payment should be made in the amount of $100.0 million. Resolution may be determined by a neutral accountant pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, however, it is currently the subject of dispute in court. If it is determined that we are required to make a significant payment to HeidelbergCement, we may not have sufficient cash to make such payment and may be required to incur additional indebtedness. This dispute is discussed in greater detail in note 14, Commitments and contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had approximately $27.5 million and $40.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively, of which $26.3 million and $33.7 million, respectively, were held by foreign subsidiaries. All of the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were readily convertible as of such dates into currencies used in the Company's operations, including the U.S. dollar. We are not aware of legal or economic restrictions on our ability to repatriate funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. We do not have any present intention to repatriate these . . .

Forterra IPO Is A North America Water Infrastructure Play - Forterra (NASDAQ:FRTA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Forterra IPO Is A North America Water Infrastructure PlayOct.11.16 | About: Forterra (FRTA) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryForterra is a dominant water infrastructure rollup seeking $340 million in its IPO.The company is the result of seven tuck-in and transformative acquisitions in the last three years.The water infrastructure market is set to grow significantly in the years ahead.Forterra is well-positioned to serve both the water and drainage markets.My opinion on the IPO is a CAUTIOUS BUY, as the company has yet to prove itself by growing revenues organically.Quick Take Forterra (NASDAQ:FRTA) wants to raise $340 million in an IPO for its infrastructure water and building pipe business. 

 The market for North American water infrastructure projects is projected to grow significantly in the years ahead, as municipal entities and residential real estate stoke demand. My opinion on the IPO is a CAUTIOUS BUY. 

  Company Forterra is the new name for a group of building products companies that have been acquired and combined by large private equity firm Lone Star Funds. The company serves most U.S. and Eastern Canadian markets via its 96 manufacturing facilities and 5,565 employees. Forterra's motto is "The First Mile to the Last Mile," which means it covers the water infrastructure grid for residential, nonresidential and infrastructure markets. Company CEO is Jeffrey Bradley, who has been with the firm since September 2015 and was previously CEO of Globe Specialty Metals. Forterra has two presidents, who oversee the two company's two main divisions:
  Mark Carpenter, President, Drainage Pipe & Products William Kerfin, President, Water Pipe & Products  Technology The company manufactures water, drainage, structural and storm water pipe and management systems. Product families include:  Drainage Pipe & Products Water Pipe & Products Structural & Specialty Products Storm Water Management Systems  Thus, the company's products range from large diameter piping that delivers water from treatment centers, manages drainage along transportation corridors and smaller diameter pipe that delivers potable water to end-users. Below is a brief video from Forterra:  (Source: Forterra YouTube) Forterra claims to be "the largest producer of concrete drainage pipe and precast products by sales volume in the United States and Eastern Canada." Market The U.S. market size for drainage and water transmission pipes is estimated to be $18 billion by 2018, representing 7.7% per year growth, according to a report by Freedonia Group. Per the report, most of the demand will come from municipal end uses, while building construction will be the fastest-growing segment. Interestingly, the study says that the "best opportunities by product will be found in the dominant and fastest-growing plastic pipe segment." Forterra also cites an improving picture for US residential housing starts after a 50-year low experienced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and real estate crash: 

 (Source: U.S. Census Bureau/Forterra S-1 Filing) An additional source of support for the large market opportunity was in December 2015 when the US federal government enacted the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or the FAST Act, which authorized $305 billion of funding over five years to upgrade transportation-related infrastructure, most of which pertains to highway spending.
 This source of funding positively impacts the company's Drainage Pipe & Products business which is a function of new highway construction and existing highway improvement projects. An even greater potential market size was explored in the 2010 report by the US Conference of Mayors - Mayor's Water Council. The report anticipated a 20-year spending need for water infrastructure of $3.8 trillion, assuming a mid-range growth rate of 5.22%. Competition Direct competitors differ depending on the product segment, but include the following companies:  Rinker Materials/Cemex (NYSE:CX) Oldcastle LaFarge/Holcim (HOLN.F) McWane American Cast-Iron Pipe Company Thompson Pipe Group  As a result of Forterra's active acquisition history which includes seven acquisitions in the past three years, the company is one of the few market participants of scale, and several other competitors are significantly smaller in size. Acquisitions have been both tuck-in and transformative and have added to the company's potential investment value of being able to provide significant exposure to the twin markets of Drainage Pipe & Products and Water Pipe & Products. Below is a chart showing the combined 2015 results by segment and end market: 

 (Source: Forterra S-1 Filing) The chart indicates an almost even distribution between Drainage and Water Transmission segments and a diversified end market division of revenues. Financials Forterra's recent financials present a picture best summarized as:  Increasing Revenues, likely due to its acquisitions Increasing, though uneven, Gross Margins Variable Cash Flow from Operations High total debt  Below are the company's predecessor and successor operational results for the past 2 ½ years (2014/2015 Audited GAAP, 2016 unaudited):
 

 (Source: Forterra S-1 Filing) Revenue  H1 2016: $640 million, 67% increase over prior 2015: $855 million, 16% increase over prior 2014: $737 million  Gross Margin  H1 2016: 20% 2015: 13% 2014: 14%  Cash Flow From Operations  H1 2016: $6.4 million used 2015: $73.2 million 2014: $26 million  As of June 30, 2016, Forterra had $41.8 million in cash and total debt of $1.45 billion. IPO Details Forterra wants to raise $340 million in net proceeds by offering up to 19.8 million shares at a midpoint price range of $20 per share. A total of 63.8 million shares will be outstanding after the IPO, assuming the underwriters purchase all options available to them. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for the following items:  $260 million to repay outstanding indebtedness under its junior term loan $36 million to repay outstanding indebtedness under its senior term loan $7.8 million to pay a prepayment penalty for its junior term loan the remainder ($36.2 million) for working capital and general corporate purposes  Upon completion of the offering, private equity firm Lone Star Funds (through its indirect interest in sole shareholder Forterra US Holdings LLC) will still own 67.5% of the outstanding common stock and may not sell its shares for a period of 180 days after the effective date of the prospectus, the normal and customary lock-up period. No other shareholders will be directly selling in the IPO, although company directors and executives own interests in Forterra US Holdings, which is the only selling shareholder. Goldman Sachs is the lead left underwriter. Credit Suisse is also a joint book-running manager, and has conflicts of interest due to its existing loans to the company.
 Commentary Forterra appears to be the culmination of an acquisition 'rollup' effort by private equity firm Lone Star Funds with the goal of developing a water infrastructure powerhouse. As the US and Canada have significant deferred water infrastructure projects, the company appears to be perfectly placed to take advantage of recent funding legislation and significant need for municipal water project maintenance and replacement. Additionally, as the residential real estate market continues its steady rebound after the financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008, Forterra appears to be well positioned to take advantage of that growth. Of course, much of this growth potential is dependent on the continued low-interest rate environment enabling government budget expenditures and private industry residential real estate development. Valuing a combination like Forterra which is growing as a result of its acquisition success presents a challenge. Price/Sales A Price/Sales multiple for a comparable basket of building materials companies is approximately 1.15x. Given Forterra's significant revenue growth, which is partly a function of its recent acquisition history and can't continue indefinitely, and due to its favorable diversification between drainage and water segments, I would assign it a Price/Sales multiple of 1.5x. 2016 annual revenue run rate of $1.28 billion x Price/Sales multiple of 1.5 = $1.92 billion valuation. EV/Sales Assuming a $1.92 billion enterprise value, the resulting EV/Sales multiple would be: 2.57x I'm only cautiously optimistic about the IPO because it's an unknown as to how well the company can drive toward profitability after digesting so many acquisitions over the past three years. Also, sales growth, once the acquisitions have come to an end, will need to be entirely organic in nature, and the company has not yet proven itself as to its ability to grow organically. Since the company is proposing to value itself at approximately $1.3 billion, I would consider the IPO a CAUTIOUS BUY.

Forterra floats 29 percent stake in $340 million initial public offering

Water and wastewater infrastructure-geared Forterra Inc., a recently established entity emanating from Forterra Building Products, raised $340 million in a mid-October initial public offering, trading under the symbol FRTA on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. In U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, the company indicated that the IPO would give new investors and principal owner Forterra US Holdings LLC, respectively, 29 percent and 71 percent stakes in a 96-plant operation with annual sales of about $1.6 billion across Drainage Pipe & Precast Products and Water Transmission Pipe & Products segments.
“Our extensive suite of end-to-end products covers ‘the First Mile to the Last Mile’ of the water infrastructure grid, ranging from large diameter pipe that transports water to and from treatment centers and manages drainage along major transportation corridors, to smaller diameter pipe that delivers potable water to, and removes wastewater from, end users in residential and commercial settings,” Forterra tells investors in its prospectus. “We employ a specialized technical salesforce, including engineers and field service representatives, which enables us to deliver a high degree of customer service, create tailored solutions and ensure our products meet project specifications to maximize applications in the field. Our product breadth, footprint in the United States and Eastern Canada and significant scale help make us a one-stop shop for water-related pipe and products, and a preferred supplier to a wide variety of customers, including contractors, distributors and municipalities.”
Irving, Texas-based Forterra US Holdings is controlled by Lone Star Fund IX (U.S.), L.P., part of a family of investments under a private equity specialist with offices in Dallas, New York and Europe. Lone Star acquired Hanson Building Products from HeidelbergCement AG in March 2015, rebranding the Pipe & Precast, Pressure Pipe and Bricks businesses under the Forterra banner six months later. Lone Star positioned Forterra Building Products for an 18-month acquisition spree totaling upward of $1 billion. It extended the pipe & precast footprint in the Upper Midwest and Tennessee by acquiring Cretex Concrete Products and Sherman-Dixie Concrete, and created a complementary water transmission segment through the acquisition of ductile iron pipe leader U.S. Pipe Inc.
Ahead of the IPO, Lone Star officials have streamlined the Forterra portfolio around water and wastewater transmission and conveyance products and structures, and separated legacy, United Kingdom-centered Hanson Bricks production and distribution assets. Their SEC filings present Forterra Inc. as the largest producer, by sales volume, of concrete drainage pipe and precast (70 plants), plus concrete pressure and ductile iron pipe (26 plants), in the U.S. and Eastern Canada. The Drainage Pipe & Precast Products segment accounts for 47 percent of sales, while the Water Transmission Pipe & Products accounts for 53 percent.
EXECUTIVE TEAM
Leading Forterra are CEO Jeffrey Bradley, who arrived in September 2015 with chief executive experience from Globe Specialty Metals and Claymont Steel, guiding each through IPOs; Executive Vice President and CFO William “Matt” Brown, who joined in April 2016 after serving in similar capacities with U.S. Concrete Inc.; Drainage Pipe & Products President Mark Carpenter, who transitioned to senior vice president and general manager for the Forterra segment after serving as Hanson Engineered Products senior vice president, responsible for North American pressure pipe, U.S. structural precast and Eastern Canada gravity pipe and precast businesses; and, Water Pipe & Products President William Kerfin, who served as U.S. Pipe vice president of Sales and, earlier in his career, vice president of Finance at Griffin Pipe Products Co., subsequently acquired by U.S. Pipe.
PRECAST CONCEPTS, J&G DEALS
Amid the IPO, Forterra anticipates fourth quarter closing on the bolt-on acquisitions of J&G Concrete Operations LLC, a pipe and box culvert producer in Waxahachie, Texas, for $32 million; and, Precast Concepts, a small- to large-bore concrete pipe producer in Henderson, Colo., for $67 million. Both businesses will join the Drainage Pipe & Products segment. They follow more than $300 million in deals majority Forterra owner Lone Star Funds IX has effected since mid-2015 with an eye to a stronger, national footprint in concrete pipe and drainage structures.

CEO Jeffrey Bradley opened the Nasdaq Market on October 20, the first day Forterra shares traded for investors outside IPO sponsors.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Press Release
Wynnchurch Capital (“Wynnchurch”) and Comvest Partners (“Comvest”) announced the sale of USP Holdings Inc. (“U.S. Pipe” or the “Company”) to Forterra Building Products, a building products company based in Irving, Texas.
Headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. Pipe is a leading manufacturer of a broad line of ductile iron pipe products, fittings and joint restraints for water distribution and water management applications. Founded in 1899, the Company has established its market leading position with a comprehensive product portfolio supported by superior quality, capabilities, innovation and service. U.S. Pipe serves a diverse group of customers, including distributors, contractors and municipalities.
“Wynnchurch and Comvest have been valued partners as we have continued to build on our position as the leading provider of ductile iron pipe products in the U.S.,” said U.S. Pipe CEO Paul Ciolino. “Each firm has significant investment and operational expertise, which helped management grow the business, drive continuous improvement and execute on our strategy. In addition, Wynnchurch and Comvest were critical in leading and executing several strategic acquisitions furthering our efforts in becoming a full-service, world class organization.” 





Wynnchurch and Comvest acquired U.S. Pipe through a divestiture from Mueller Water Products, Inc. (NYSE: MWA) in April of 2012. Since that time, the Company has achieved significant growth both organically and through five acquisitions.
Moelis & Company acted as exclusive financial advisor and Foley & Lardner LLP acted as legal advisor to U.S. Pipe in connection with the transaction.

The Company’s products, sold under the well-regarded U.S. Pipe brand, are primarily used in drinking and wastewater systems within the U.S. and are procured by waterworks distributors, residential and commercial construction contractors, utilities, and government municipalities.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
