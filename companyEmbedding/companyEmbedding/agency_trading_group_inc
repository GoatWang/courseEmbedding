Decision

Matter of:  Walker Development & Trading Group, Inc.

File:  B-414365

Date:  May 18, 2017


			Terrance Walker, for the protester.
			David G. Fagan, Esq., Department of Veterans Affairs, for the agency.
			Kenneth Kilgour, Esq., and Laura Eyester, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.


		DIGEST

		Protest challenging the agency’s decision to set aside the procurement for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns is denied where the agency had a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from at least two such firms and that award would be made at a fair market price.


			DECISION


		Walker Development & Trading Group, Inc., of Reno, Nevada, protests the terms of request for quotations (RFQ) No. VA262-17-Q-0438, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for three types of medical devices.  The protester contends that the agency’s market research provides insufficient support for the VA’s decision to set this requirement aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns.

		We deny the protest.

		BACKGROUND

		The RFQ, set-aside for SDVOSB concerns and issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) parts 12, 13, and 19 and VA acquisition regulations, sought quotations for mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT), holter monitoring, and cardiokey devices for patient care.[1]  Agency Report (AR), Tab 2, RFQ, at 2, 4.  The period of performance would be from February 22, 2017 to February 21, 2018.  Id.  Award would be made to the firm offering the lowest-priced, technically acceptable quotation.  Id. at 4.  The RFQ stated that offers would be considered technically acceptable if the quoted products and services were brand name or equal.  Id.  The agency assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334510, Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing to the RFQ; the RFQ advised firms that the Small Business Administration (SBA) had issued a nonmanufacturing rule class waiver for that NAICS code.  Id. at 1, 2.  The deadline for quotation submission was February 14, 2017.  Id. at 4.

		On February 13, Walker filed this protest challenging the adequacy of the agency’s market research.  Walker asserts that the agency unreasonably concluded that it would receive two or more quotations from SDVOSB concerns and that award would be made at a fair market price.[2]  The agency argues that the VA’s set-aside decision had a reasonable basis.

		DISCUSSION

		Generally, the decision whether to set aside a procurement for SDVOSB concerns is a business judgment within the contracting officer’s discretion, which we will not disturb absent a showing that it was unreasonable.  Aero Sage LLC, B-414314, B‑414314.2, May 5, 2017, 2017 CPD ¶ __ at 6; Starlight Corp., Inc., B-410471.2, Dec. 30, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 383 at 5.  No particular method of assessing the availability of capable small businesses is required; rather, the assessment must be based on sufficient facts so as to establish its reasonableness.  Starlight Corp., Inc., supra; Mountain West Helicopters, LLC; Trans Aero, Ltd., B‑408150, B‑408150.2, July 1, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 152 at 3.  We will not question an agency's set aside determination where the record shows that the evidence before the contracting officer was adequate to support the reasonableness of the conclusion that small business competition reasonably could be expected.  Starlight Corp., Inc., supra. 

		Further, in making set-aside decisions, agencies need not make actual determinations of responsibility or decisions tantamount to determinations of responsibility; rather, they need only make an informed business judgment that there is a reasonable expectation of receiving acceptably priced offers from small business concerns that are capable of performing the contract.  InfoReliance Corp., B-413298, Sept. 19, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 263 at 4.  Here, as explained below, Walker does not show that the VA unreasonably determined that it would receive offers from two or more SDVOSB firms at fair and reasonable prices.

		The agency’s market research included a review of the prior acquisition history and searches of the VA Western States Consortium blanket purchase agreement website, the National Acquisition Center contract catalog, and the General Services Administration’s website.  AR, Tab 3, Market Research Report, at 1-3.  In addition, the agency posted a sources sought notice, conducted a search on Vetbiz.gov, and emailed ninety-one vendors found on Vetbiz.gov with information about the procurement.  Id. at 2. 

		Some of the firms identified in those searches were found to be unable to provide the required equipment.  Id. at 2.  The VA, however, received responses from two interested SDVOSB concerns that provided capability statements and price estimates, which the agency deemed to be fair and reasonable.  Id.  During this protest, the agency provided the protester with the names of the two firms identified in the agency’s market research.  Walker has not provided a reasonable basis on which to question the agency’s assertion that competition between these two SDVOSB firms will not result in award being made at a reasonable price. 

		Walker asserts that the agency’s market research failed to consider whether an SDVOSB concern would meet the limitation on subcontracting rule and whether an SDVOSB nonmanufacturer would be providing the product of an SDVOSB concern.  Protest at 4.  Here, the agency incorporated by reference FAR clause 52.219-27, Notice of Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside, and assigned NAICS code 334510, Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing, to the RFQ.  FAR clause 52.219-27, Notice of Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside, states that SDVOSB concerns providing products as manufacturers agree that at least 50 percent of the costs of manufacturing will be performed by the concern or other SDVOSB concerns. 

		Ordinarily, in order to qualify as a small business concern to provide manufactured products or other supply items, an offeror must either be the manufacturer or producer of the end item being procured, or if it does not manufacture the item being purchased, the offeror must comply with what is known as the nonmanufacturer rule.  13 C.F.R. § 121.406(a).  The nonmanufacturer rule provides that the offer of a nonmanufacturer small business concern can be considered, provided, among other things, that the small business concern represents that it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, or that a waiver of this requirement is granted by the SBA. 15 U.S.C. § 637(a)(17); see also 13 C.F.R. § 121.406. 

		Where the nonmanufacturing rule applies to a procurement and the agency’s market research fails to consider whether the firms identified in the market research can comply with the rule, the market research is unreasonable.  Triad Isotopes, Inc., B-411360, July 16, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 220 at 7.  The SBA is permitted to waive the nonmanufacturer rule where the SBA has determined that no small business manufacturer or processor can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications or where no small business manufacturer or processor is available to participate in the procurement.  15 U.S.C. § 657s(a)(4).  When SBA issues a waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule, a firm can supply the product of any size business without regard to the place of manufacture.  13 C.F.R. § 121.406(b)(7).   

		Here, as noted above, the agency notified offerors that the SBA had issued a class waiver of the nonmanufacturer rule for the assigned NAICS code.  Consequently, we see no merit to the protester’s contention that the agency’s market research failed to consider whether the firms identified had the capability to perform and could comply with the rule.[3]

		Walker also argues that the agency failed to adequately assess whether the two identified firms could comply with the terms of the solicitation.  See Comments on AR at 5-6.  As noted above, the agency’s market research considered the capability of the vendors to meet the requirements.  The agency was not required to make a  determination of responsibility in the course of conducting market research.  InfoReliance Corp., supra. 

		The protest is denied.

		Susan A. Poling
		General Counsel






[1] The RFQ incorporated by reference FAR clause 52.219-27, Notice of Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside.  RFQ at 4. 



[2] Walker initially argued that the agency improperly issued the RFQ on a brand name only basis and conducted unreasonable market research when the agency failed to review “equal” products.  However, as the agency notes, the RFQ specifically states that the acquisition is for brand name or equal.  RFQ at 3, 4. 



[3] To the extent that Walker is arguing that the agency should have assigned a NAICS code for services and not one for manufacturing, we note that is a matter for review by the SBA and is not a matter for consideration by our Office.   4 C.F.R. § 21.5(b)(1).  Further, with respect to any of Walker’s remaining challenges to the solicitation, Walker is not an interested party to raise these concerns, given that Walker is not an eligible SDVOSB and therefore is not a prospective offeror.  4 C.F.R. §§ 21.0(a), 21.1(a); see also Encompass Group LLC, B-406346, Mar. 23, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 121 at 4-5.

Decision

Matter of:  Walker Development & Trading Group, Inc.--Costs

File:  B-414258.3

Date:  June 8, 2017


			Terrance Walker, Walker Development & Trading Group, Inc., for the protester.
			Jennifer L. Hedge, Esq, Department of Veterans Affairs, for the agency.
			Joshua R. Gillerman, Esq., and Tania Calhoun, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, GAO, participated in the preparation of the decision.


		DIGEST

		Request for recommendation that protest costs be reimbursed is denied where protest was not clearly meritorious even though agency took corrective action.


			DECISION


		Walker Development & Trading Group, Inc., a small business of Reno, Nevada, requests that we recommend it be reimbursed the reasonable costs of filing and pursuing its protest of the terms of request for quotations (RFQ) No. VA69D-17-Q-0262, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring services.  We dismissed the protest after the agency advised our Office that it was cancelling the solicitation.  Walker argues its protest was clearly meritorious and the agency unduly delayed taking corrective action.

		We deny the request.

		BACKGROUND

		The RFQ was issued on December 30, 2016, on an unrestricted basis.  RFQ at 1.  It contemplated award of a fixed-price, indefinite-quantity, indefinite-delivery (IDIQ) contract for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring services for several Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 12 medical facilities.  RFQ at 4.

		On January 2, 2017, Walker filed its initial protest arguing that the agency, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) § 19.502-2(b), should have set the requirement aside for small business.[1]  Protest at 2-3.  Walker asserted that, had the agency conducted adequate market research, it would have identified at least two responsible small business concerns capable of satisfying the requirements for cardiac monitoring services.  Walker identified itself, as well as two other specific small business concerns, as capable of satisfying the RFQ’s requirements.  Protest at 2.

		The agency filed its report on January 31.  The contracting officer (CO) stated that, after performing market research, she did not have a reasonable expectation that two or more capable small businesses would submit offers, and that these offers would be at a fair price.  Contracting Officer’s Statement (COS) for B-414258.1, at 3.  The CO subsequently posted a sources sought notice and a request for information (RFI) and received four responses.  Id.  Only two of the firms that responded were small businesses, one of which was Walker. 

		The CO reviewed the capability statements of Walker and the other small firm that submitted a response.  COS for B-414258.1, at 3-4.  The CO noted that Walker’s response failed to include any of the information required by the sources sought notice or the RFI on its ability to provide cardiac arrhythmia monitoring services.  Id.  In fact, Walker only provided a brochure advertising another firm’s product.  Id.  As for the other small business, the CO noted that it had performed poorly on a previous contract, which indicated it was incapable of performing the volume of work required by the instant RFQ.  Id.  Accordingly, the CO concluded that she did not have a reasonable expectation of receiving responses from two or more capable small business and that an unrestricted solicitation was in the best interest of the VA.  Id.

		On February 10, Walker submitted its comments on the agency report.  In its comments, Walker identified a third firm, in addition to the two identified in its protest, that was potentially capable of satisfying the requirements of the RFQ.  Comments for B-414258.1at 2, 7.  After our review of the agency’s report and the protester’s comments, we asked the agency to file a supplemental report.  In particular, we requested additional information on two potentially capable small businesses, the one raised by Walker in its comments and one identified by our review of the agency’s market research.  We also asked the Small Business Administration (SBA) to file comments on the propriety of the VA’s decision to procure this requirement on an unrestricted basis.  Id. The supplemental report was due on March 1. 

		On February 28, before filing the supplemental agency report, the VA advised our Office that it intended to take corrective action by “cancelling the solicitation, reviewing market research and re-examining the set-aside determination.”  Agency Notice of Corrective Action for B-414258.1, Feb. 28, 2017, at 1.  The VA further advised that following these actions, it “may determine that a different set-aside determination is warranted.”  Id.  Based on the notice of corrective action, we dismissed the protest as academic.  This request followed. 

		DISCUSSION

		Walker argues that its protest was clearly meritorious and the agency unduly delayed taking corrective action.  Request for Costs at 2.  We note at the outset that when a procuring agency takes corrective action in response to a protest, our Office may recommend reimbursement of protest costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if, based on the circumstances of the case, we determine that the agency unduly delayed taking corrective action in the face of a clearly meritorious protest, thereby causing the protester to expend unnecessary time and resources to make further use of the protest process in order to obtain relief.  Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, 31 U.S.C. § 3554(c)(1)(A); Bid Protest Regulations, 4 C.F.R. § 21.8(e); East Coast Nuclear Pharmacy--Costs, B-41205.3, Aug. 31, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 249 at 3.  As a prerequisite to our recommending the reimbursement of costs where a protest has been resolved by corrective action, not only must the protest have been meritorious, but it also must have been clearly meritorious.  AGFA Healthcare Corp.--Costs,  B-400733.6, April 22, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 90 at 2.  A protest is clearly meritorious where a reasonable agency inquiry into the protest allegations would have shown facts disclosing the absence of a defensible legal position.  Chase Supply, Inc.,--Costs, B-411849.3, May 17, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 134 at 5. 

		We find that reimbursement is not appropriate in this case since, even if we agreed with Walker that the agency’s corrective action was not prompt, the protest was not clearly meritorious.  As explained above, reaching a decision on the protest required further development, which is why our Office requested supplemental information from the VA.  Following this further development of the record, we would have had to conduct further analysis of the parties’ positions.  Because the ultimate resolution of the protest required further development, in our view, the protest presented a close question, and therefore was not clearly meritorious.  Systems Research and Applications Corp.--Costs, B-406775.3, Apr. 10, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 99 at 5; Yardney Technical Prods., Inc.--Costs, B-297648.3, Mar. 28, 2006, 2006 CPD ¶ 65 at 4.  Accordingly, we decline to recommend reimbursement of Walker’s protest costs.

		The request is denied.

		Susan A. Poling
		General Counsel

		 






[1] Under FAR § 19.502-2(b), a procurement with an anticipated dollar value of more than $150,000 must be set aside for exclusive small business participation when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from at least two responsible small business concerns, and award will be made at a fair market price.  See also 13 C.F.R.  § 125.2(f)(2).
