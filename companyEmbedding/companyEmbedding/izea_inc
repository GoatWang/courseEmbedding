					Full Description



IZEA, Inc. (IZEA) incorporated on March 22, 2010, operates online marketplaces that facilitate transactions between brands and content creators. These creators produce and distribute text, videos and photos on behalf of brands through Websites, blogs and social media channels. The Company's technology enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics and payment processing. Brands and Publishers (collectively Brands) engage IZEA in order to gain access to its technology and network of creators. These companies are its primary customers and use its technology for various purposes, such as the engagement of online influencers for sponsored social campaigns (Sponsored Social), or the creation of standalone content for distribution through their owned channels (Content).The Company provides services to customers in various industry segments, including consumer products, retail/e-Tail, technology and travel. The Company's customers are located in the United States, as well as Canada, India, the United Kingdom and over 150 other countries. Its business serves advertising and public relations agencies, as well as brands and businesses directly. IZEA works with brands to facilitate sponsored social campaigns at scale. Sponsored Social is when a company compensates an online influencer, such as a blogger or tweeter (creators) to share sponsored content with their social network following. This sponsored content is included within the body of the content stream, a practice also referred to as native advertising and sponsored content. IZEA works with brands and publishers to augment or replace their content development efforts. These clients use its platform to produce both editorial and marketing content that is published both online and offline. The Company's network includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers and everyday content creators, allowing its clients to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Its content customers use this service to create a stream of posts for their corporate blog.The Company's platforms include IZEA.com and The IZEA Exchange (IZEAx), and Ebyline. IZEAx provides a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of various types of content, including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a range of social channels, including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr. The system is available to its customers and partners through a self-serve portal, as a managed service or as a licensed white label. Ebyline is a content marketplace, which replaces editorial newsrooms located within newspapers with a Virtual Newsroom. Ebyline focuses on producing content for brands in addition to newspapers. IZEAx and Ebyline streamline transactions between brands and creators. Each platform provides brands with access to a network of creators along with complete workflow management, content control, payment processing and performance tracking. For sponsored social campaigns, IZEAx provides integrated Federal Trade Commission (FTC) legal compliance. The Company also offers account management services to manage campaigns on behalf of the customer. This includes working with brands to optimize the opportunity that is presented to creators, providing instructions on what is required to fill the opportunity, identifying and sourcing the creators that are fit for the opportunity, managing the offer and acceptance process with the creators, verifying that the creators' content, once submitted, meets the requirements of the opportunity, and managing the overall campaign to meet the goals of the brand. Account managers also provide clients with progress updates on their campaign that include campaign metrics and all postings created throughout the campaign. Additionally, they assemble campaign recaps at the conclusion of the campaign and work with the advertisers on plans for follow-up strategies after the initial campaign has ended.The Company's platforms provide for the ability to review creators' content prior to publishing, and all the other platforms provide for a review after the content is published. If the content does not conform, the creator is requested to make any necessary adjustments. If the creator refuses, the opportunity is deemed to have been withdrawn. Neither the brand nor its account management staff modifies creators' content without the creators' involvement and consent. The Company has over 629,000 user connections from approximately 358,000 user accounts in IZEAx. The Company provides the ability to target its creators based on a range of software rules and filters. It provides self-service platforms that service all business types and sizes. Unlike traditional public relations, advertisers only pay for completed posts. The Company provides trackable results by automatically embedding tracking links and pixels, as well as support, for third-party tracking. It also provides dashboards for real-time reporting, providing feedback.The Company competes with Facebook, Glam Media, Twitter, BlogHer, TapInfluence and Collective Bias.

IZEA: The Art of 'Content Marketing'






By Richard Finger

































The internet has spawned a universe of self-anointed experts pontificating on an array of topics as diverse as our universe itself. The "blogosphere" has become a ubiquitous arm of the internet and social media as this horde of the content creators blog, Tweet and share photos and video on Instagram, Flickr or YouTube.  Some create blogs simply as a passion and are satisfied with attendant psychic gratification. As with any revolution, change is rapid and iterative. Known by various names "social sponsorships," "content marketing," "sponsored content" is a way the ordinary content provider can monetize their content be it blogs, video, pictures or tweets. The jargon is fluid, and it may also be called "marketing through the social media stream." 
IZEA Inc., through their website, has created the world's largest network to match content providers and advertisers. Particular sponsors or advertisers, often giant multinational corporations pay content providers, to create target advertising for their products or services via a blog, picture, tweet or video. An example might be a woman being paid to post an Instagram picture of her in a particular brand of sunglasses or a blogger being paid by Verizon to extol the virtues of their 4G wireless service performance. Keep in mind, this is very distinct from display ads or "banner advertising" in the form of pictures and ad copy that appear on a website next to a blog article. Those promotions are mainly the purview of Google AdWords or Google AdSense.
I had a chance to talk with CEO and IZEA founder Mr. Ted Murphy about some of the recent developments at this rapidly-growing company. In January of this year, in a cash and stock deal for $8.9 million, IZEA purchased Los Angeles based Ebyline. This company matches their vetted proprietary database of freelance writers, photographers and other content creators with businesses who are, for example, marketing products or expanding brand awareness. It is complementary to the existing IZEA business model and now allows for them to do a fully managed "concierge" advertising campaign. For example, Pepsi might now come to IZEA and like to buy 2,000 blog posts over the next six months. Now, with an in-house staff of writers IZEA can manage the content and efficiently control the placement of the articles.
On March 25, a press release announced IZEA has partnered with ad agency Allison+Partners, recently named PRWeek's "2015 Midsize Agency of the Year". Allison+Partners will adopt the IZEAx platform and bring their stable of clients to the IZEA catalog of content creators. It should be a win-win for both outfits.
IZEA currently boasts a list of over 250,000 discrete registered content creators or "influencers" as they are so-called. Any "influencer" with desire to monetize their social media stream can simply sign up for free on the website. IZEA can connect them with their over 50,000 registered advertisers and agencies including many of world's top brand names: Audi, Volvo, Michelin, Unilever, Pepsi, Revlon, Kleenex, Kraft, Citibank and Allstate.
What can a blogger or tweeter or Instagram-er expect to get paid by posting a picture blowing your nose with a Kleenex tissue? How long is a string? Celebrity Kim Kardashian, with her millions of Twitter followers, may get paid many thousands for a single tweet. A mommy blogger talking about the local PTA may never be picked up by any advertisers. How much is your influence or clout? While the vast majority can expect less, there are many IZEA "influencers" who make $3,000 or $5,000 monthly. Maybe they have 30,000 or 40,000 page views per month... or maybe they have a smaller audience but write about a specific topic that targets an advertisers product. For example, perhaps a blogger writes explicitly about chainsaws and so a chainsaw manufacturer may be willing to pay significant dollars for that blogger to create content about their brand. It is the proprietary IZEA algorithm that helps advertisers determine what an Instagram photo of an attractive woman with a distinct brand of nail polish is worth.
Full disclosure is made for all "sponsored content" per Federal Trade Commission regulations.  The FTC guidelines are explicit:

When there exists a connection between the endorser and the seller of the advertised product, which might materially affect the weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is not reasonably expected by the audience), such connection must be fully disclosed.
IZEA is in complete compliance with FTC rules.
IZEA is a publicly traded company. It is listed on the over the counter market that is primarily reserved for micro-cap stocks. It currently has a market capitalization of around $21 million and on an operating basis is not quite in a positive cash flow position. There is no debt on the balance sheet, but there might be another secondary stock offering to fund both operations and installment payments coming due on the Ebyline purchase. Venture capital-based companies are focused on scale or size, rather than profitability. If the company should become profitable in the near term, different financing options will become available.
The 2014 total revenues for IZEA were around $8.3 million and for 2015 CEO Murphy expressed optimism that internal growth combined with the ebyline acquisition, that year 2015 will generate $23 million in sales. When I touched on the issue of profitability Mr. Murphy expressed the following thoughts. He quickly focused on the importance of achieving scale. Though they are, by a large measure, number one operator in the space, he thinks it is critical to put so much more distance between IZEA and its competitors. I think the plan is to become analogous to Amazon. -- the 800-pound gorilla. Therefore, at this stage in the company's evolution, there is no definitive metric to discern whether this company is either overvalued or undervalued.  Currently, a lot of money is being spent marketing to attract as many bloggers, Tweeters and Instagram-ers to their platform. Significant funds are also funneled to engineering to perfect the already industry leading proprietary IZEAx platform agnostic software. Content providers can link social media accounts from any of the following networks: Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Flickr. You name it; the connectivity is likely available.
Ending 2014 with $6 million in cash on their balance sheet and no long term debt the company is in a healthy financial position. By financing growth with equity offerings rather than debt, IZEA exhibits a conservative management style that suggests they are in for the long haul and will be able to weather any unforeseen exogenous economic events. The market is exploding in size. According to statista dollars spent on "content marketing" is expected to increase from $5 billion in 2013 to $15 billion by 2018. By capturing just a few percentage points of those numbers, IZEA Inc. might just be a real winner.

1. INTRODUCTION
ContentMarketing.com, content.ebyline.com, IZEA.com, and corp.izea.com (the “Sites”) are owned and operated by IZEA, Inc.  Access to the Sites and any features is made available under IZEA's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.
IZEA, Inc is a member of the IZEA Exchange and provides you, and, if applicable, your Affiliates, access to its online site at app.izea.com known as The Creator Marketplace (the “Marketplace”). The Marketplace allows Marketers and Creators to interact and engage in marketing relationships to create and/or distribute unique sponsored social content often through a Creator’s social network (“Marketplace Services”) subject to your acceptance of and compliance with these terms of use (the “Terms” or the “Agreement”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Marketplace Services or access izea.com or any of its affiliated sites. Each time you use the Marketplace, the current version of the Terms will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Service, you should check the date of the (which appears at the top of this document) and review any changes since the last version. The Terms will be available at all times at app.izea.com.
In the Terms, (i) “Marketer” means any person or entity who participates in the Marketplace Services directly or by IZEA authorized personnel on behalf of Marketer for the purpose of creating Opportunities to use the services of a Creator, (ii) “Creator” means any person, entity or group that creates and distributes the sponsored social content and/or performs an action through their associated social networks (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc.) via the Marketplace and receives compensation for such content or action via the Marketplace, (iii) “Affiliate” means any authorized entity or person that directly or indirectly controls the transactions of the Marketer or Creator. The term “control” with regard to this definition means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, written voting rights agreement, written agreement, title or other influence, (iv) “Opportunity” means a request by a Marketer for a Creator to create and/or distribute sponsored social content and/or perform an action through their social network. These Terms shall apply to all transactions conducted through the Marketplace.
1.1. OPPORTUNITIES
Participating Marketers create and list opportunities ("Opportunities") in the Marketplace, which offer Creators the chance to receive compensation in exchange for creating and/or distributing sponsored social content and/or performing an action through their social network. All Opportunities accepted by the Creator must comply with the requirements set forth by the Marketer (herein referred to as the "Requirements") in the Opportunity. Each Opportunity listing should contain a complete description of the requirements and the compensation to be paid by the Marketer. Once an Opportunity is accepted by a Creator, the Marketer is solely responsible for the review and approval of the Creator’s content within three (3) days of posting and for the payment of any compensation as stated in the Opportunity.
ContentAmp® Projects
Marketers may present projects within the IZEA Marketplace for cost per click campaigns (“ContentAmp Project(s)”).  Marketers, or IZEA at a Marketer’s request and direction, will select and upload a link to a digital article or feed to be promoted, and establish a fee to be paid out per click for promotion until the budget for the ContentAmp Project has been depleted or the ContentAmp Project ends.
Creators may participate in a ContentAmp project by following the instructions in the Marketplace. Participation in the project is subject to availability. Thirty (30) days after the ContentAmp Project expires, Creators whose participation was accepted within the timeframe and the allotted budget will receive payment.  Amounts to be paid to Creators are based on IZEA’s internal click tracking system, which shall be the sole method of calculating clicks, and will not be limited by the source of such traffic.  The logic behind IZEA’s click tracking system algorithm may be altered or updated at any time without notice to either Creators or Marketers.  Fees will not be paid out in excess of a Marketer’s maximum ContentAmp Project budget.
IZEA may, at its discretion, review feeds or links submitted by a Marketer, but will not be responsible for the content or validity of same.  IZEA is not responsible for the accuracy or compliance of Marketer- or Creator-supplied Content.  Similarly, IZEA may review and approve Creators to participate in ContentAmp opportunities, but cannot guarantee specific creator types or categories, nor target particular audiences.  Instead, IZEA will only review to ensure that Creators meet the minimum terms for participation in the IZEA Exchange platform.
Unless a Marketer indicates that it does not wish to participate in a ContentAmp Project (which can be accomplished by “stopping” the ContentAmp Project as indicated in the Marketplace), IZEA is authorized to offer any submitted articles for promotion by Creators and charge any Creator-earned click-based fees against the Marketer’s balance or to the method of payment associated with the Marketer’s account. These clicks may not be fully calculated and reconciled until the original end date of the Project, regardless of receipt of an earlier request to stop the Project.
In the event any budgeted funds are unused, the non-refundable remainder will be deposited into the Marketer’s account and applied to future transactions within the IZEA Marketplace, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing (email is sufficient).  Should the Marketer’s account balance at any time fall below the amount required to cover the funds of an active ContentAmp Project, IZEA is authorized to automatically charge such amounts to the method of payment associated with the Marketer’s account.
1.2. REVIEWS & APPROVALS
While IZEA personnel may assist in reviewing and identifying Creator's posts or actions that violate an Opportunity's Requirements and attempt to resolve disputes, Marketers in their sole discretion shall determine whether a particular Creator is entitled to the set compensation so long as the Marketer observes the requirements of Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 of this Agreement. IZEA reserves the right to review and reject Opportunities from Marketers that do not meet our Marketplace Guidelines. Posts which do not comply with the Requirements of the Opportunity will not be entitled to the compensation associated with such Opportunity. Once an Opportunity and link to a post has been agreed upon and submitted by a Creator, a Marketer has three (3) days to respond with any requested modifications or to reject the post. Failure to do so will result in automatic approval of the link and result in automatic, non-refundable payment to the Creator as long as the link is active 30 days from approval. Final approval and payment to the Creator will occur if the link is active 30 days from approval and remains unaltered from the original approved submission. The IZEA Exchange will automatically check for active posts and make payments to the Creator on behalf of the Marketer. If the automated system fails to locate required elements, destination links and disclosure, no payment will be made to the Creator and funds for the Opportunity will be returned to the Marketer.
2. ELIGIBILITY
You must be eighteen (18) years or older to register as a Marketer or Creator in the Marketplace. By registering in the Marketplace, you are representing and warranting that all information you submit is truthful and accurate, and that you agree to maintain the accuracy of such information. You understand and agree that IZEA will use the information you provide in accordance with the terms of the IZEA Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is integrated into and included as part of these Terms. IZEA accounts are not transferable, assignable or resalable under any circumstances.
3. MARKETER TERMS
This Section 3 applies only to Marketers participating in the Marketplace.
3.1. TRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE
IZEA requires full disclosure by all Marketplace participants. More specifically, the connection between the Marketer and the Creator that would affect how people evaluate the Creator’s message should be disclosed. Any attempt to instruct, coerce or manipulate a Creator into hiding the commercial relationship between the Marketer and the Creator may result in immediate removal from the system. Marketer agrees to comply with the Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (see generally http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising/advertisement-endorsements, the Federal Trade Commission’s Dot-Com Disclosures (http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf), the Word of Mouth Marketing Association’s Influencer Handbook (https://womma.org/are-you-making-good-use-of-the-influencer-guidebook/)); and all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
3.2. PAYMENTS
Marketer agrees to pay IZEA all charges made to Marketer’s account for agreed upon fees or use of the Marketplace Services in accordance with these Terms. If IZEA does not receive timely payment and the balance in the Marketer account is not enough cover agreed upon fees or Marketplace Services hereunder: (i) a charge will be made to the Marketer’s credit card or other preferred payment method for the balance owed, (ii) Marketer agrees to pay all amounts due on its account upon demand, and (iii) IZEA reserves the right to either suspend or terminate a Marketer’s account, including deletion of Marketer’s Opportunities from the Marketplace until the balance is paid in full. All fees for the Marketplace Services which are charged to Marketer account, as well as all deposit(s) for future Marketplace Services, are non-refundable. Marketer agrees to submit any disputes regarding any charge in writing to IZEA within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. In the event Marketer’s payment method cannot be charged, Marketer account will be locked until an update method is provided.
If Marketer fails to make payment as set forth herein, Marketer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by IZEA in collecting such amounts. All prices are in United States dollars and do not include taxes that may be assessed by any jurisdiction. If withholding taxes or any other fees are imposed by any jurisdiction on the transactions pursuant to this Agreement, Marketer shall pay such taxes to ensure that IZEA receives the full amount invoiced without offset or deduction. Marketer agrees to promptly: (i) update all information to keep account and credit card billing current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address or e-mail), (ii) notify IZEA in writing if it becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Marketer’s user name or password, and (iii) notify IZEA in writing if its credit card is canceled. Upon termination, suspension or discontinuation of the Marketplace or Marketer’s participation therein, all outstanding payment obligations incurred by Marketer under the Marketplace will become immediately due and payable.
As of September 30, 2015, if an account is or becomes inactive for 180 days, the balance in the account will begin incurring charges for inactive fees. If charged, this fee is non-refundable. The inactive fee is $25 after 180 days of inactivity, $50 after 210 days of inactivity and the balance remaining in the account, if any, after 240 days of inactivity.
Users may choose to use the Payments feature within the platform to reimburse Creators for expenses incurred on a campaign or transactions completed outside of the platform.  Creators may submit items for payment, but users have the final decision on what will be approved.  Funds will issue from a user's account immediately upon authorization of the payment, and any amounts issued through the Payments feature are not refundable.
3.3. CREDIT CARD CHARGES
Marketer authorizes IZEA to charge Marketer’s credit card, as provided by the Marketer, in advance to deposit funds into the Marketer’s account. Once funds are deposited into the Marketer’s account, they may be used at the Marketer’s discretion, to purchase Marketplace Services or pay for agreed upon fees. Marketer will be responsible for charges resulting from the use of Marketplace Services and any applicable service fees will be automatically withdrawn from the Marketer’s balance monthly based upon the initial enrollment date.
Marketer represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use any credit card utilized in connection with any transaction. By submitting such information, Marketers grants IZEA the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by the Marketer. If the credit card provided was not authorized, then all amounts in the Marketer’s account will immediately be forfeited. Marketer’s non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace reaffirms that IZEA is authorized to charge Marketer’s credit card.
IZEA reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the required method of payment for use of the Marketplace at any time, although any pending Opportunities will be completed using the method current when the Opportunity was listed. If IZEA modifies the terms of the method of payment as outlined in this Section 3.3, the Marketer will be contacted by IZEA or the modifications will be reflected in an updated version of this Agreement. If you do not consent to such modified Agreement, you must immediately discontinue using the Marketplace. Marketer's continued enrollment after any modifications constitutes its acceptance of the terms and method of payment as modified.
All Marketer Opportunities may be taken offline if Marketer’s credit card does not allow additional charges or rejects any pre-authorized charges made to it. Unless Marketer or IZEA discontinues enrollment or participation in the Marketplace Services, Marketer understands that this pre-authorization is valid until the termination of this Agreement or the applicable Master Services Agreement with IZEA. For your future reference, you agree to retain, either by printing or otherwise saving, a copy of this Agreement, which provides the terms of your pre-authorization.
3.4. NON-CIRCUMVENTION
Marketer may not attempt to contact Creators or negotiate terms or payment outside of the Marketplace. Any attempt to circumvent the Marketplace may result in removal from the Marketplace at IZEA's sole discretion.
3.5. MANUAL PROCESSING REQUESTS
The Marketplace reviews Creator's posts for compliance with the criteria set forth in the Opportunity using both an automated system and a manual system. IZEA cannot guarantee whether a Creator's posts will be reviewed manually or through our automated system. If a Marketer would like to ensure that a Creator's post will be manually reviewed for compliance with the Opportunity criteria, such service is available for an additional fee.
Marketers may also request to have IZEA manage part or all of its advertising campaign for a fee as agreed upon through a separate managed service agreement. Interested parties should contact IZEA directly.
If necessary, a Marketer may request that a Creator's post in response to an Opportunity be removed from the Creator's social media site or personal website. IZEA may assist Marketer in requesting a Creator to remove a post and additional fees may apply; however, IZEA cannot guarantee removal of the post by the Creator.
3.6. CONTENT INFORMATION
Marketer agrees that IZEA is not responsible for any aspect of Marketer's content or product to be reviewed, shared, sponsored, or advertised by the Marketplace’s contracted Creators. Marketer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) all information it provides or approves or that is provided on its behalf in connection with the Agreement and on its Website is, and will be updated to remain, current and accurate, (ii) the Website to which any links are included in a listed Opportunity will look substantially the same to all end users regardless of the end users' location, (iii) the Marketer’s Website does not contain any IZEA-owned or licensed content, except pursuant to a separate signed agreement with IZEA. You acknowledge that The Marketplace Creators are independent third parties and not directly controlled by IZEA. As a consequence, any blog postings or sponsorship of your content or product(s) will inherently risk negative or unflattering comments about your content, product(s) or company. Marketer specifically acknowledges and agrees that IZEA has no control over any content that may be available or published on any blog (or otherwise), and that Marketer is solely responsible (and assumes all liability and risk) for determining whether or not such Blogs and/or Posts are appropriate or acceptable to you.
3.7. OPPORTUNITY DISPUTES
Marketer agrees that so long as a Creator has met the requirements as outlined in its Opportunity it will not deny payment for the Marketplace Services. Marketer may not discriminate based on the racial, physical, political, spiritual, age, gender or sexual orientation characteristics of the Creator. Thirty (30) days after completion of the Opportunity, payment will be made to the Creator by IZEA for services unless the Creator has violated the terms of this Agreement or the specific terms of the Marketer’s Opportunity.
4. CREATOR TERMS
This Section 4 applies only to Creators participating in the Marketplace.
4.1. TRANSPARENCY & DISCLOSURE
Creators participating in the Marketplace must clearly disclose in their sponsored content the relationship between themselves and the Marketers. IZEA requires that disclosure be made in a meaningful way that makes clear to an ordinary consumer that there is a relationship between the Creator and the Marketer. IZEA reserves the right to review and monitor the disclosure practices of all Creators who participate in the Marketplace and to either require greater levels of disclosure (in the event that IZEA determines in its sole discretion that current disclosure practices are inadequate) or remove the Creator from the Marketplace (in the event of inadequate disclosures). Creator agrees to comply with the Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (see generally http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising/advertisement-endorsements); and to comply with all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations, including but not limited to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, in the preparation and delivery of Content.
4.2. CREATOR ELIGIBILITY

Connection must not contain a content gap of more than 90 days;
Connection must be public (accessible to anyone);
Connection must contain a majority of original content;

After 30-days from publication and upon successful validation of the Opportunity, the Creator will receive payment for the completion of the Opportunity as agreed upon between the Marketer and the Creator in the Opportunity.
For participation in the eBay for SocialLinks program, Creator agrees to also be bound by the eBay Terms and Conditions, eBay organization Network Agreement and Code of Conduct.
4.4. CREATOR COMPENSATION
Creator acknowledges and agrees that the obligation to compensate Creator for Opportunity-related advertisements resides with the Marketer, not IZEA. IZEA merely facilitates such compensation on behalf of the Marketers. Marketer is solely liable for payment to Creator. While IZEA may be remitting payment to Creator directly; under no circumstanced does IZEA accept liability for payment to Creator. Creator agrees that it will not pursue any actions, legal or otherwise, against IZEA for non-payment. Creator waives any and all claims or rights of action against IZEA relating to the failure of a Marketer to compensate Creator in connection with an Opportunity-related advertisement. In addition, Creator acknowledges that Creator is: (i) not an employee of IZEA, (ii) responsible for the payment of all federal, state and local taxes on compensation received from a Marketer, (iii) responsible for any reporting requirements imposed by the federal, state or local government, and (iv) responsible for compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations.
4.5. CREATOR CREDIT CARD CHARGES AND FEES
If Creator enrolls in a subscription agreement or agrees to other charges to its account, Creator may be asked to provide a form of payment such as a credit card or PayPal account. Creator represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use such form of payment utilized in connection with any transaction. By submitting such information, Creator grants IZEA the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by the Creator. Creator’s non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace reaffirms that IZEA is authorized to charge Creator’s credit card for the use of the requested Marketplace Services.
In the event Creator’s payment method was not authorized or cannot be charged for any agreed upon fees, the Creator’s account will be locked. As of September 30, 2015, if an account is or becomes inactive for 180 days, the balance in the account will begin incurring charges for inactive fees. The Creator further acknowledges that the inactive fee is $25 after 180 days of inactivity, $50 after 210 days of inactivity and the balance remaining in the account, if any, after 240 days of inactivity. If charged, this fee is non-refundable. The Creator also agrees that all earnings will be forfeited if its account is terminated for any reason or if IZEA discontinues providing service through the Marketplace.

Any use, publishing, or distribution of a Creator’s content by IZEA or any other Marketer may be accompanied by credit to the Creator of that content by use of the Creator’s name, likeness or other identifying representation, to which Marketer will receive a limited license.
“Content” Opportunities: Marketers purchasing Content through IZEA Exchange shall own the copyright in and to the commissioned content created specifically for those Marketers and may use, reproduce, have reproduced, edit for length or clarity, publish and exploit such Content in their sole discretion, including, without limitation, licensing the Content to any agent or third party, copying, distributing, displaying, publicly performing, and creating derivative works of the Content.  Creators shall consider the Content to be a work-for-hire and shall assign all rights in such Content to Marketers through the appropriate platform in the IZEA Exchange.
Celebrity Creator Content: Celebrity-created content requested pursuant to a Statement of Work between Marketer and IZEA shall be owned by such celebrity and licensed to Marketer pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement between IZEA, Inc. and the celebrity.
5. NON-CIRCUMVENTION
Creators and Marketers may not attempt to contact the other party directly or negotiate terms or payment outside of the Marketplace. Any attempt to circumvent the platform may result in removal from the Marketplace, at IZEA's sole discretion.
6. CONFIDENTIALITY
“Confidential Information” means any information disclosed to a Marketer or Creator by IZEA, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, other than information that you can establish: (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure to you by IZEA; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure to you by IZEA other than through your action or inaction; or (iii) is in your possession, without confidentiality restrictions, prior to the time of disclosure by IZEA as shown by your files and records.

Marketer and/or Creator agree to take all measures to protect the secrecy, and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use, of the Confidential Information. Marketer and/or Creator may disclose Confidential Information if required by law to disclose the Confidential Information, provided that you give IZEA prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure, and provided further that any such disclosure is limited to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the legal requirement. All Confidential Information shall remain IZEA’s personal property and all documents, electronic media and other tangible items containing or relating to any Confidential Information shall be delivered to IZEA immediately upon IZEA’s request, and also, upon termination of the Agreement. Nothing contained in the Agreement will prevent IZEA, its parent and/or affiliates from complying with privacy laws and regulations, and if there is any conflict between the Agreement and the terms of the applicable Privacy Policy, the Agreement shall control. Marketer and Creator may not issue any press release or other public statement regarding the Agreement, IZEA, its parent and/or its affiliates without IZEA’s prior written consent.

Only a written instrument executed by the party waiving compliance may waive the terms or covenants of the Agreement.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 07/06/2009
            

                BBB has determined that IZEA, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

Advertise Honestly

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
