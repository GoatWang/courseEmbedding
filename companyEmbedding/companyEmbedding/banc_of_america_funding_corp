                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The rating actions are a result of the recent performance of the underlying 
pools and reflect Moody's updated loss expectation on the pools. 
The rating upgrades are a result of the improving performance of the related 
pools and / or an increase in credit enhancement available to the bonds. 
The rating downgrades are due to the weaker performance of the underlying 
collateral and / or the erosion of enhancement available to the bonds.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "US RMBS Surveillance 
Methodology" published in January 2017. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Chevy Chase Funding 
LLC, Mortgage-Backed Certificates, Series 2005-1 
Cl. NIO was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
Securities" published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released 
a Request for Comment (RFC), in which it has requested market feedback 
on potential revisions to its cross-sector rating methodology for 
rating structured finance IO securities. Please refer to Moody's 
RFC titled "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities " for further details regarding 
the implications of the proposed methodology revisions on certain Credit 
Ratings.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:




Ratings in the US RMBS sector remain exposed to the high level of macroeconomic 
uncertainty, and in particular the unemployment rate. The 
unemployment rate fell to 4.5% in March 2017 from 5.0% 
in March 2016. Moody's forecasts an unemployment central range 
of 4.5% to 5.5% for the 2017 year. 
Deviations from this central scenario could lead to rating actions in 
the sector.




House prices are another key driver of US RMBS performance. Moody's 
expects house prices to continue to rise in 2017. Lower increases 
than Moody's expects or decreases could lead to negative rating 
actions.




Finally, performance of RMBS continues to remain highly dependent 
on servicer procedures. Any change resulting from servicing transfers 
or other policy or regulatory change can impact the performance of these 
transactions.

A list of updated estimated transaction pool losses and bond recoveries 
are being posted on an ongoing basis for the duration of this review period 
and may be found at:

REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Announcement: Moody's: No negative ratings impact from amendments to 671 Bank of America-serviced RMBS deals






                    Global Credit Research - 28 Jun 2013
                









New York, June 28, 2013 -- Moody's Investors Service stated today that proposed amendments to servicing 
agreements of the affected transactions listed below will not, in 
and of themselves and at this time, result in a reduction or withdrawal 
of Moody's current ratings of the securities issued by the affected transactions.




Bank of America N.A. (BANA), the servicer for the 
affected transactions, requested that Moody's provide its opinion 
on whether the ratings of the securities issued by the affected transactions, 
would be downgraded or withdrawn as a result of three amendments that 
are being made to the servicing agreements for the affected transactions.




The first series of amendments will allow servicing advances in the affected 
transactions to be funded by an advance facility. The second amendment 
will require that the account used by the servicer to hold monthly collections 
from borrowers be held at a depository institution whose long-term 
unsecured debt obligations are rated at least A2 by Moody's and whose 
commercial paper, short-term debt obligations, demand 
deposits or other short-term deposits are rated at least P-1 
by Moody's. The final amendment modifies a servicer replacement 
event in several of the affected transactions listed below. Currently, 
the master servicer and the trustee have the option to terminate the servicer 
if its servicer rating falls below the servicer rating as of deal closing. 
The amendment changes the reference date from closing date to a servicing 
transfer date should there be a transfer of servicing. 




Moody's view is based primarily on its opinion that a) including an option 
to fund the advances in the transaction through an advance facility will 
not have a negative impact on servicer's ability to perform its servicing 
duties and therefore will not affect the affected transactions' performance 
b) the new ratings requirements for depository institutions are consistent 
with Moody's guidelines "The Temporary Use of Cash in Structured 
Finance Transactions: Eligible Investment and Bank Guidelines" 
published in March 18, 2013 and c) changing the reference date for 
the servicer termination event does not have a negative credit impact 
because it is a conforming change in the event servicing transfers.




Moody's believed that the amendments did not have an adverse effect on 
the credit quality of the securities such that the Moody's ratings were 
impacted. Moody's did not express an opinion as to whether the 
amendments could have other, non credit-related effects.

rating, and servicer termination event:

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

RATINGS RATIONALE




In today's action Moody's has corrected the ratings on all of the 
affected tranches due to an internal administrative error, these 
tranches were not included in the February 22, 2012 rating action 
on certain RMBS interest-only securities. The methodologies 
used in these ratings were "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities" published in February 2012, and 
"Moody's Approach to Rating US Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities" 
published in December 2008. Please see the Credit Policy page on 
www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




The primary source of assumption uncertainty is the uncertainty in our 
central macroeconomic forecast and performance volatility due to servicer-related 
issues. The unemployment rate fell from 9.0% in April 
2011 to 8.2% in July 2012. Moody's forecasts a further 
drop to 7.8% for 2013. Moody's expects house prices 
to drop another 1% from their 4Q2011 levels before gradually rising 
towards the end of 2013. Performance of RMBS continues to remain 
highly dependent on servicer procedures. Any change resulting from 
servicing transfers or other policy or regulatory change can impact the 
performance of these transactions.




Notional balances of Option ARM IOs are linked to either a single pool, 
multiple pools, single tranche or multiple tranches and contain 
a principal-only (PO)component. The balance of the PO component 
increases based on the amount of deferred interest allocable to the IO 
class. Option ARM IOs ratings are based on the WARF rating of the 
IO component rating using this methodology and the principal-only 
(PO) component rating using the RMBS methodology for Option ARMs.

3 of the Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies. 
Further information on the EU endorsement status and on the Moody's 
office that has issued a particular Credit Rating is available on www.moodys.com.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides relevant regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides relevant regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides relevant regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




Information sources used to prepare each of the ratings are the following: 
parties involved in the ratings, parties not involved in the ratings, 
public information, confidential and proprietary Moody's Investors 
Service information, and confidential and proprietary Moody's 
Analytics information.




Moody's received and took into account a third-party assessment 
on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial 
instruments in these transactions and the assessment had a neutral impact 
on the rating.




Moody's considers the quality of information available on the rated 
entities, obligations or credits satisfactory for the purposes of 
issuing these ratings.




Moody's adopts all necessary measures so that the information it 
uses in assigning the ratings is of sufficient quality and from sources 
Moody's considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, 
independent third-party sources. However, Moody's 
is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or 
validate information received in the rating process.

ratings.




Please see the ratings disclosure page on www.moodys.com 
for general disclosure on potential conflicts of interests.


Please see the ratings disclosure page on www.moodys.com 
for information on (A) MCO's major shareholders (above 5%) and 
for (B) further information regarding certain affiliations that may exist

entities that hold ratings from MIS that have also publicly reported to 
the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%. A 
member of the board of directors of this rated entity may also be a member 
of the board of directors of a shareholder of Moody's Corporation; 
however, Moody's has not independently verified this matter.


Please see Moody's Rating Symbols and Definitions on the Rating Process 
page on www.moodys.com for further information on the meaning 
of each rating category and the definition of default and recovery.


Please see ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the last rating action and the rating history.


The date on which some ratings were first released goes back to a time 
before Moody's ratings were fully digitized and accurate data may not 
be available. Consequently, Moody's provides a date that 
it believes is the most reliable and accurate based on the information 
that is available to it. Please see the ratings disclosure page 
on our website www.moodys.com for further information.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

MOODY’S DEFINES CREDIT RISK AS THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY MAY NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL, FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE AND ANY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CREDIT RATINGS DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER RISK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET VALUE RISK, OR PRICE VOLATILITY.

NEITHER CREDIT RATINGS NOR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS COMMENT ON THE SUITABILITY OF AN INVESTMENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. MOODY’S ISSUES ITS CREDIT RATINGS AND PUBLISHES MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INVESTOR WILL, WITH DUE CARE, MAKE ITS OWN STUDY AND EVALUATION OF EACH SECURITY THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASE, HOLDING, OR SALE. MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY RETAIL INVESTORS AND IT WOULD BE RECKLESS AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO USE MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS OR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Everywhere we look, we see people working hard each and every day. Hard for our families, our communities, our jobs.
We all face challenges, and yet, fight each moment along the way with conviction and courage. Courage to change a circumstance, courage to rally a community, courage to create a moment in time that leads to better.
We see successes big and small, responsibilities tackled together with drive and determination. And it drives us to invest in you, our partners, and our communities. Creating partnerships that connect people and communities to opportunity. Building a clear path to economic progress for all ages, races, and lifestyles.
From those looking for a second job, to those who provide a second chance, we believe in offering a chance to build and sometimes rebuild careers, lives, and communities.
At Bank of America, we have a clear purpose, to make financial lives better. To work hard with you, to invest in the future, and to be a partner along the way. We are driven by hard work, by partnerships, and shared success. We are driven by you.

We’re advancing pathways to economic mobility in order to build thriving communities. 
At Bank of America, we live our purpose to make financial lives better by fulfilling our environmental, social and governance (ESG) responsibilities. As part of this work, we develop strong partnerships with nonprofit organizations serving community needs, bringing our collective networks and expertise to help communities grow and thrive.
We recognize that while conditions have improved over the past several years, there are many individuals facing barriers to economic success, including youth, working families, and the formerly incarcerated. Too many individuals living on the margins are limited by their zip code and unable to create a better life for themselves and their families through good jobs or affordable housing. That’s why we’re focused on building pathways to economic mobility by addressing the issues of workforce development & education, basic needs and community development. We’re committed to advancing a more diverse and inclusive society by expanding opportunities and supporting equitable solutions that will enable low-income communities to grow and prosper. Through our philanthropic efforts and the power of our employee volunteers, we’re working to create thriving economies and a better future for us all.
Learn more about our charitable funding priorities.
In 2017, the Bank of America Charitable Foundation will issue two requests for proposals (RFPs) on the priority focus areas of:

Economic mobility focused on the needs of individuals and families by investing in workforce development & education and basic needs (Applications accepted 1/30/2017 – 2/24/2017) More details
Economic mobility by addressing community development needs by investing in affordable housing, community revitalization, arts, and the environment (Applications accepted: 5/8/2017 – 6/2/2017) More details



Economic mobility focused on the needs of individuals and families 
We focus on the economic mobility of individuals and families by investing in workforce development & education and addressing basic needs.
Today, more than 48 million people are living in poverty and struggling to meet their needs while facing tough choices on where to place limited resources. We recognize that basic needs must be met in order for families to advance along the economic continuum. In addition, access to education and job training are critical to lift people out of poverty, connecting them to tools that will help them build better lives. That’s why we’re partnering with nonprofits who are supporting a diverse talent pipeline that will better serve community needs, providing skilled workers to organizations while creating economic opportunity.  We partner with nonprofits who are addressing the economic continuum, including critical needs (food and shelter) to job skills training, all of which contributes to alleviating poverty and building thriving communities.
Funding priorities and examples:
Critical needs, such as hunger relief and services for the homeless – we support nonprofit organizations that meet individuals and families at their point of need so that they can overcome fundamental challenges, achieve stability, and improve their financial lives.

Local food banks, soup kitchens, school- and after-school-based child feeding and nutrition programs that provide free or subsidized food, clothing, and other critical necessities
Programs and services that prevent or end homelessness, like rental assistance, emergency shelter, rapid-rehousing, and permanent supportive housing, including Housing First

Youth employment – We recognize that first time jobs are critical to helping young people develop essential skills that will assist them throughout their career development. Access to employment can enhance overall educational experiences and keep at-risk youth on track for successful careers by reducing high school dropout rates and increasing transition to college.

High school completion programs, skills-training (hard and soft skills), seasonal employment, internship opportunities, mentoring for teens and young adults, social enterprises
National service programs that develop essential career skills and establish a pathway to future employment endeavors

Preparing individuals for meaningful employment – We support nonprofit organizations providing access to skills training, credentialing and education - regardless of gender, race, criminal record or disability - that will enable individuals to connect to jobs and develop a stronger financial future.

Job preparedness, training, skills building, college or vocational certification, career counseling, placement, job retention, and entrepreneurship leading to livable wage jobs
Social enterprises, other transitional employment and workforce re-entry programs tied to job training and placement for the unemployed, under-employed, formerly incarcerated, homeless, and disconnected youth putting people on track for growth and meaningful employment

Wrap Around Services – We recognize that low-income individuals and families face a variety of challenges, have diverse needs and may qualify for multiple services, so we support nonprofit organizations providing supportive services that will enable individuals and families to move forward.

Bundled services – Organizations that offer services and benefits, direct or in collaboration with other providers, that addresses employment, asset building, financial coaching and education
Benefits access and referral programs
Networks, programs, and services that are working to break the cycle of poverty
Organizations advancing better money habits through financial education and coaching

Applications accepted 1/30/2017-2/24/2017


Economic mobility by addressing community development needs 
We are focused on economic mobility by addressing community developed needs through investments such as affordable housing, community revitalization, arts, and the environment.
An individual’s zip code should not define their economic well-being, educational attainment and overall health. However for many across our country this remains a significant challenge as they pursue their financial, educational and employment goals. Economic opportunity begins with the ability to live and work in vibrant communities, with access to safe, decent housing, strong business corridors, and to arts and culture.  So our funding efforts focus on the work of local, national and global nonprofit organizations working together addressing these issues essential to an individual’s economic mobility and the community’s vitality.
Building Vibrant CommunitiesSupporting local and regional revitalization efforts taking a holistic approach to building thriving communities, create economic opportunity and livable neighborhoods. This includes support of economic drivers such as arts and cultural institutions that contribute to the overall vitality of the community.

Economic development efforts that promote small business growth and healthy commercial corridors
Revitalization initiatives that engage community stakeholders in the economic growth of the communities. (e.g. transit oriented development as means to connect individuals to jobs services and economic opportunity, Neighborhood preservation strengthening overall community health, safety and welfare)
Supporting community arts and cultural institutions that provide economic opportunity and contribute to the vitality and livability of communities
Supporting efforts that create healthy neighborhoods through the preservation, creation or restoration of open/green/parks space

Expanding Access to Housing OpportunitiesSupporting the efforts and programs of nonprofit organizations creating pathways to economic mobility as they work to preserve, and increase access to a mix of affordable housing options, connect individuals and families with tools, resources, to achieve their financial goals

Organizations whose housing efforts address the needs of vulnerable populations (e.g. low and moderate income, homeless, elderly, formerly incarcerated) as they construct or preserve affordable single, multi-family, transitional and supportive housing.
Supporting organizations creating pathways to stable housing or homeownership through financial stability efforts such as homebuyer education, budgeting, savings, credit and credit repair including foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation
Organizations whose affordable housing programs support healthy environments through the pursuit of energy efficiency upgrades, retrofits, solar and other green building efforts.

Applications accepted: 5/8/2017 – 6/2/2017

How to find funding

Review the community grants and sponsorships offered from Bank of America to help benefit your nonprofit organization. Our grants can be used as general operating support as well.







							Nonprofit grant funding


At Bank of America, we’re helping build thriving communities by addressing issues fundamental to economic health and sustainability. We are advancing economic mobility by addressing issues related to workforce development and education, community development, and basic needs. As a financial institution, we respond in two ways—by helping to address the immediate need as well as longer term solutions for economic self-sufficiency. And we’re investing $2 billion over ten years in this effort. Learn more about Bank of America Charitable Foundation funding priorities.

							Sponsorships


Through our regional U.S. sponsorships, we support the economic, social and cultural life of the places we live and work. We provide an extensive program of arts and sports sponsorships to help maintain vibrant, healthy communities. This includes underwriting art exhibitions, events and performances that require private funding to make them a reality. Our regional sports sponsorship investments include the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, Major League Baseball® and Bank of America 500®.

							Matching gifts


The Bank of America Charitable Foundation Matching Gifts program encourages employees to contribute to qualifying charitable organizations. The program offers a way to double – up to $5,000 (US) per person each calendar year – employees’ cash or securities contributions to their favorite charitable organizations and thus improve their communities.

							Volunteer


Bank of America employees and retirees volunteer thousands of hours globally in our neighborhoods each year. In fact, more than 3,000 charitable organizations benefit from our employees and retirees’ dedication each year. To honor those who give their time and service to causes important to them, the Bank of America Charitable Foundation awards grants, which are up to $500 per employee or retiree for each calendar year and are made in the name of the employee or retiree, to eligible charitable organizations.

Advertising Practices
We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit.

If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
