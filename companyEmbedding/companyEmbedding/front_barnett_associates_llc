Economic Update - Fed Quandary: Inflation
July 20, 2017 - Economic indicators we monitor show the US economy, now entering its ninth year of expansion, growing moderately and still creating jobs at a healthy clip, but unable to gain additional momentum beyond the 2% rate of GDP growth of the past 5 years. As we have previously pointed out, unfavorable demographics and lack of productivity improvement remain powerful headwinds to a more rapid rate of economic expansion absent the enactment of a fiscal stimulus agenda.
Payroll growth in the recently released June employment report stands out as the best economic news so far this year. Job gains have averaged 180,000 per month, down only slightly from the average in 2016 and well above the pace that would be sufficient to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force. The unemployment rate has fallen about ¼ percentage point since the end of last year and, at 4.4% in June, is more than 5 percentage points below its peak in 2010. A broader measure of labor market slack, the so called U6 unemployment rate, which includes workers marginally attached to the labor force and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work, has also fallen this year and is now nearly as low as it was just prior to the recession. It is also encouraging that jobless rates have continued to decline for most major demographic groups, including African Americans and Hispanics.
Although real GDP increased at an annual rate of only 1.5% in the first quarter, more recent indicators point to a rebound in expected growth in the second quarter to about 2.6%. Household spending, which was weak early in the year, has picked up in recent months, supported by job gains, rising household wealth, and generally favorable consumer sentiment. In addition, business fixed investment, largely in the energy sector, has turned up this year after having been soft in 2016. And strengthening economic growth abroad and a weaker US dollar have provided important support for US manufacturing production and exports. The housing market has continued to recover gradually, aided by the ongoing improvement with labor market and mortgage rates which remain at relatively low levels. All in all, we have an economy growing steadily, though only at a moderate pace.
