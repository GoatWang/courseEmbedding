The Georgian Terrace



Atlanta
 
Grand yet welcoming, The Georgian Terrace is the epitome of true Southern hospitality. Built in 1911, this historic icon soon became known as  “The Grande Dame of Atlanta.” Modernized in 1991 with the addition of a new tower, the hotel remains a celebrated architectural masterpiece situated at the heart of Atlanta’s Midtown Mile, directly across from the world-famous Fox Theatre and adjacent business and commercial districts.
Fully renovated in all areas, including $6.0 million in guest room upgrades since 2014, The Georgian Terrace boasts 326 well-appointed rooms, over 16,000 square feet of world-class business facilities, and three classic ballrooms. The hotel’s own Livingston Restaurant + Bar, Edgar’s Proof & Provision, and Buffalo Bayou Coffee offer innovative Southern-inspired cuisine, spirited libation, and local brews while ensuring The Georgian Terrace remains “Atlanta’s Modern Classic” for generations to come.
Take me to Atlanta

A member of the Historic Hotels of America,  The Georgian Terrace opened in 1911, and many of the original architectural details—including floor-to-ceiling windows and majestic marble columns—are still in place today.

The Sotherly Experience

At Sotherly, we are dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel. That’s why we’ve made delivering true Southern Hospitality our central mission. Because to us, Southern Hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity; it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see, feel, taste, and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer, both during their stay and after they leave.
Our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a Southern summer night.


We’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind, weaving our trademark Southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin.
At the end of the day, our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such.  Our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again, and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders.










Sotherly Foundation

The Sotherly Foundation is the community outreach arm of Sotherly Hotels. We created the Foundation in 2015 because we wanted to take a more hands-on approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels, one family at a time.
Each year, the Sotherly Foundation will provide significant aid to one or more American veterans living in the communities around its hotels. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible. All recipients are chosen by the Sotherly Foundation Board of Directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the United States Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment.
The majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels, although the Foundation does accept donations from the general public as well. As a 501(c)3 registered non-profit, all contributions to the Sotherly Foundation are tax-deductible.

The Whitehall



Houston
Built in 1963 in the heart of downtown Houston, The Whitehall quickly established itself as one of the city’s most stylish and well-known hotels and remains so to this day. Superbly located within walking distance of such leading business and leisure destinations as the George R. Brown Convention Center, Rice University, Minute Maid Park, and Houston’s Theatre District, the hotel is directly connected via skywalk to more than 2 million square feet of Class-A office space with major tenants such as KBR, Chevron and United Airlines. The hotel offers 259 guest rooms and 12,000 square feet of meeting space.
Sotherly Hotels acquired the property in November 2013, adding to its portfolio a prized, high-performing asset in the heart of the largest MSA in the southern United States. In 2014, Sotherly began a comprehensive $5.0 million renovation and rebranding of the hotel that included updates to The Whitehall’s guest rooms and public spaces, the creation of two new food and beverage outlets, Part & Parcel and Buffalo Bayou Coffee, as well as an upgraded look and concept for the hotel’s existing restaurant, Edgar’s Hermano.
Take me to Houston








Houston’s own

The Whitehall is home to downtown favorite Buffalo Bayou Coffee, which proudly roasts locally-based JAVA PURA coffee and serves a variety of homemade baked goods, sandwiches, and salads for guests on the go.






More to come

Meanwhile, The Whitehall’s newest addition, an outdoor restaurant and bar focusing on craft beer, specialty cocktails, and local fare, will be the only establishment of its type in downtown Houston when it opens in Spring 2016.

The Georgian Terrace



Atlanta
 
Grand yet welcoming, The Georgian Terrace is the epitome of true Southern hospitality. Built in 1911, this historic icon soon became known as  “The Grande Dame of Atlanta.” Modernized in 1991 with the addition of a new tower, the hotel remains a celebrated architectural masterpiece situated at the heart of Atlanta’s Midtown Mile, directly across from the world-famous Fox Theatre and adjacent business and commercial districts.
Fully renovated in all areas, including $6.0 million in guest room upgrades since 2014, The Georgian Terrace boasts 326 well-appointed rooms, over 16,000 square feet of world-class business facilities, and three classic ballrooms. The hotel’s own Livingston Restaurant + Bar, Edgar’s Proof & Provision, and Buffalo Bayou Coffee offer innovative Southern-inspired cuisine, spirited libation, and local brews while ensuring The Georgian Terrace remains “Atlanta’s Modern Classic” for generations to come.
Take me to Atlanta








A taste of the South

The Georgian Terrace is home to Edgar’s Proof & Provision, a Prohibition-style bourbon bar known among locals for its artisan craft cocktail menu and mouthwatering small plates.






Hollywood heritage

The Georgian Terrace holds a special place in Hollywood history. In 1939, it hosted the official “Gone With the Wind” pre-premiere party, and continues to play host to many television and film productions taking place around Atlanta today.






Locally Roasted

The Georgian Terrace is home to Buffalo Bayou Coffee, which proudly serves Batdorf + Bronson’s Dancing Goats Blend, roasted locally in the heart of Atlanta.

The Sotherly Experience

At Sotherly, we are dedicated to understanding and serving our guests better than anyone else because we believe guests are the heart of every hotel. That’s why we’ve made delivering true Southern Hospitality our central mission. Because to us, Southern Hospitality isn’t a regional curiosity; it’s an authentic experience that helps our guests see, feel, taste, and enjoy everything the local culture has to offer, both during their stay and after they leave.
Our generations of hospitality experience have taught us that guests want their hotel to feel like a natural extension of the city they’re visiting – they want it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings like a front porch into a Southern summer night.


We’ve designed our hotels with our guests in mind, weaving our trademark Southern charm into every corner of the guest experience to make sure that guests feel so connected to the local area and so refreshed by its culture that they’ll soon forget where the city ends and the hotel walls begin.
At the end of the day, our guests are like our family – and we treat them as such.  Our ultimate goal is to turn moments into lasting memories that will keep guests coming back time and time again, and it’s our belief that happy guests lead to happy shareholders.










Sotherly Foundation

The Sotherly Foundation is the community outreach arm of Sotherly Hotels. We created the Foundation in 2015 because we wanted to take a more hands-on approach to making a difference in the communities surrounding our hotels, one family at a time.
Each year, the Sotherly Foundation will provide significant aid to one or more American veterans living in the communities around its hotels. Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we work directly with the veteran and his or her family to find out what they need most and to determine a strategy for meeting that need in the most lasting and meaningful way possible. All recipients are chosen by the Sotherly Foundation Board of Directors with assistance from qualified organizations like the United States Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment.
The majority of all funds raised comes from the hard work and caring dedication of the employees of our hotels, although the Foundation does accept donations from the general public as well. As a 501(c)3 registered non-profit, all contributions to the Sotherly Foundation are tax-deductible.


For more information on the Sotherly Foundation, visit our site at sotherlyfoundation.com or send us an email anytime at foundation@sotherlyhotels.com.
