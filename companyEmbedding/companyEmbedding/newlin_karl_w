The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

About Karl Labertew
Senior Litigation Attorney
Hello, my name is Karl W. Labertew, and I’m honored you have taken the time to review my bio. While not a native Floridian (I was raised in the mountains of Colorado), Central Florida has always been special to me. After an absence of nearly thirty years, I’ve returned to serve the people of this area. I’ve spent a lifetime serving others and I look forward to serving you.
My passion for service began with a career in the armed forces, serving proudly and with distinction in the United States Navy. While in the Navy, I was a mechanical operator in nuclear power plants, as well an air conditioning specialist and engineering instructor. While on shore duty after nearly nine years at sea, and working as an engineering instructor, I attended the University of Rhode Island, earning my bachelor’s degree in two years. I was selected for Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, which is where I met my wife, and where the desire to attend law school came to fruition. I attended Loyola University New Orleans, and upon completing my degree, came back to Pensacola to serve those who most needed my help. In working with my clients I came to realize that not everyone gets a fair shake in life and in our justice system, and I made it my calling to zealously help those people I was given the honor of representing.
In 2010 I went to work for a large insurance defense firm and learned first-hand how insurance companies work to protect themselves and not those hurt by the actions of others. I’ve handled hundreds of cases, from auto accidents and slip-and-falls to wrongful death claims. Throughout the process, I learned how insurance companies defend these suits, up to and through the trial process. I have earned the Martindale-Hubbell® esteemed “AV Preeminent” rating, which recognizes lawyers with the highest ethical standards and professional ability.
Coming to work for a great firm such as Dan Newlin & Partners has given me the opportunity to take all of my years of trial experience and knowledge, and put it to work for those people who need it most. When you need an advocate, I will always be on your side. Each of my cases is important to me, because you are important to me. I’m always available to answer questions and explain all aspects of your case. My goal is to ensure your experience with me and our firm is a positive one, and I won’t rest until that happens. If you are in need of legal help from an accident, Injury or wrongful death I would be honored to personally help you.
