                        Lakewood Capital Group, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Lakewood Capital Releases Detailed Presentation On Select Income REIT And Issues Open Letter To Shareholders

NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lakewood Capital Management, LP (together with its affiliates, "Lakewood"), the second largest unaffiliated shareholder of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company") (NYSE:   SIR) with current ownership of approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of SIR, today announced that it has filed a detailed presentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  In the presentation, Lakewood outlines its concerns with SIR's governance and the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR").  The presentation also includes detailed information regarding the vast qualifications of Lakewood's nominee for election to SIR's Board of Trustees, William H. Lenehan.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated Mr. Lenehan, a real estate executive with significant public company experience, for election to the Board of Trustees at SIR's 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Lakewood firmly believes that Mr. Lenehan's election as a Trustee would give shareholders a voice towards improving the Company's corporate governance and share price performance.  As set forth in more detail in the presentation, Lakewood believes that with proper governance improvements, SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of over 50% above recent trading levels.
Lakewood's detailed presentation is available at the SEC's website and can be viewed by clicking the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Additionally, Lakewood announced today it has delivered an open letter to SIR shareholders, the full text of which follows:
January 14, 2015
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Funds managed by Lakewood Capital Management, LP ("Lakewood") currently own in the aggregate approximately 7.0% of the outstanding shares of Select Income REIT ("SIR" or the "Company").  We are long-term SIR shareholders, having owned shares since the days immediately following the Company's initial public offering in March 2012.  Like many of you, we have grown frustrated with the poor governance at SIR that we believe has led to the stock's significant discount to net asset value and dramatic underperformance over the past year.  We believe this remarkably low stock valuation and significant share price underperformance is a direct result of governance concerns resulting from the misalignment of incentives between the Company and its manager, Reit Management & Research LLC ("RMR"), and a Board of Trustees that has not duly protected the interests of shareholders.  On December 5, 2014, Lakewood nominated William H. Lenehan, a highly qualified real estate executive with significant public company experience, to the Board of Trustees to give shareholders a voice and improve the Company's governance.   
Earlier today, we filed a detailed presentation with the SEC that is available on the SEC's website at the following link: http://tinyurl.com/Lakewood-Presentation-Jan15 
Specifically, our presentation outlines the following:

Our belief that SIR shares could be worth $40 per share or more, representing an increase of 50% above recent trading levels. 
How SIR's stock trades at a deep discount to its net asset value and has dramatically underperformed its peers due, we believe, to widely-held concerns around corporate governance. 
The misalignment of interests due to SIR's external management structure in which RMR receives fees almost entirely based off of the size of the assets of the Company, as opposed to SIR's share price performance. 
Several recent actions taken by the Board of Trustees that have only served to deepen investor mistrust. 
Our belief that shareholders will benefit meaningfully from enhanced governance and greater accountability. 
The vast qualifications of William H. Lenehan, our nominee to the Board of Trustees and an accomplished real estate executive who can help improve governance at SIR.
RECORD DATE
Please note that we have been advised that SIR has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of a Wednesday, January 21, 2015 record date for the SIR 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting").  For comparison, this date is 48 days earlier in the year than expected based on last year's record date of March 10, 2014 for the 2014 Annual Meeting.  We have serious concerns that the acceleration of the record date will disenfranchise certain shareholders with respect to the election of trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
IMPORTANTLY, IF SIR SETS JANUARY 21, 2015 AS THE RECORD DATE FOR THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING, ANY SHARES MUST BE PURCHASED FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BY THE END OF TRADING ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2015 (ALLOWING FOR A THREE DAY SETTLEMENT PERIOD) TO BE ENTITLED TO BE VOTED AT THE 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.  FURTHERMORE, SIR SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CALL THEIR BROKER TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SHARES ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING LENT OUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SHARES ARE IN THEIR BROKER'S POSSESSION AND CAN BE VOTED AT THE SIR 2015 ANNUAL MEETING.
We look forward to communicating with you in more detail in the weeks to come regarding our serious concerns at SIR and the election of our highly qualified nominee to SIR's Board of Trustees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  
Sincerely,
Anthony T. Bozza
