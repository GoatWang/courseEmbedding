History[edit]
Origins[edit]
CareFusion completed its spin-off from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. Businesses that were part of the Clinical and Medical Products segment of Cardinal Health were spun off to create CareFusion. CareFusion began publicly trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 1, 2009, with former CEO David Schlotterbeck.[citation needed]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 17, 2010, CareFusion acquired Medegen, Inc. for US$ 225 million in cash.[4] On February 1, 2011, Kieran T. Gallahue was named CareFusion's chairman and CEO.[5] In April 2012, CareFusion sold the Nicolet operating unit to Natus Medical Incorporated for $58 million. On July 7, 2012, CareFusion acquired U.K. Medical Limited, a distributor of medical products to the National Health Service and private health care sector in the United Kingdom.[6] In November 2012, CareFusion acquired Intermed Equipamento Medico Hospitalar Ltda, a privately held respiratory technologies company based in Cotia, Brazil. Intermed designs, manufactures and markets ventilators and respiratory care devices for infant, pediatric and adult patients that are used in hospitals in Brazil, Latin America and Europe.[7]
On November 18, 2013, CareFusion acquired Vital Signs Inc., a medical device manufacturing business, with the exception of European operations from GE Healthcare.[citation needed] In 2013, CareFusion bought 40% of the Israeli company Caesarea Medical Electronics.[8]
Dispute with the US Department of Justice[edit]
In January 2014, the United States Department of Justice reached a USD $40.1 million settlement with CareFusion.[9] The Department of Justice alleged that CareFusion paid its CEO USD $11.6 million to influence the Safe Practices Committee at the National Quality Forum to recommend, promote and arrange for the purchase of that company's products.[9][10] The CEO called the kickback allegations "surprising" while his attorney emphasized that the whistleblower lawsuit contains no allegations against the CEO.[11]
An analysis by ProPublica reported that the National Quality Forum's final 2010 guidelines, currently in effect, still recommend 2% Chlorhexadine and 70% alcohol, which is the formulation of ChloraPrep.[12]The NQF agrees that this is consistent with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.[13][14]
Business segments[edit]
Most recently CareFusion had two business segments, providing the following products

Dispensing: Pyxis medication and supply automation products
Infusion: Alaris Infusion pump and infusion safety products
Respiratory: AVEA,LTV series of ventilators, Intermed ventilator and AirLife respiratory accessories which provided the following products and services

SAN DIEGO, Feb. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- CareFusion Corporation (NYSE:   CFN), a global, medical technology company, announced today the appointment of Kieran T. Gallahue as chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding David L. Schlotterbeck who previously announced plans to retire later this month.
A seasoned medical-technology executive, Mr. Gallahue, 47, was most recently president and CEO of ResMed (NYSE:   RMD), a global leader in medical equipment for treating, diagnosing and managing sleep-related respiratory disorders. 
During his tenure, the company grew revenue approximately 500 percent to $1.2 billion, while expanding operating margins and increasing net income more than 20 percent annually. He built an exceptional management team and global organization that commercialized products in more than 70 countries.
Mr. Gallahue has nearly 20 years of strategic, operational and corporate management experience in the health care industry, with deep expertise in the medical technologies field. Since 2007, he has also served on the board of Volcano Corp., a developer of products for interventional cardiology.
"Kieran brings strategic, operational and public company experience to CareFusion, with a proven track record of growth – all qualities that were critical in our search process," said J. Michael Losh, presiding director of the CareFusion board. "CareFusion has ample opportunities to grow and innovate, as we execute against our near-term plans to expand margins. We see a clear path to create exponentially greater value and believe Kieran is an ideal fit to accelerate this work."
Mr. Gallahue said, "It is a rare opportunity to join a company with an end-to-end portfolio of category leading products yet with such growth potential on the top and bottom lines. I have been very impressed in my early discussions with the board and management team. While I will miss my colleagues at ResMed, I am proud of the extraordinary, market-leading company we have built there and am energized about the future at CareFusion." 
Mr. Gallahue served as president, CEO and a director of ResMed since January 2008. He joined the company in January 2003 as president and COO of the Americas, and was promoted in September 2004 to the role of ResMed's global president and chief operating officer. Prior to joining ResMed, he held positions of increasing responsibility at Nanogen, a DNA research and medical diagnostics firm, and Instrumentation Laboratory, a leader in diagnostic instruments for critical care and hemostatsis. He has also held marketing, sales and financial roles at The Procter & Gamble Company and GE.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Accounting from Rutgers University and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.

CareFusion Names Kieran T. Gallahue Chairman and CEO
As CEO of ResMed, Gallahue drove substantial revenue and EPS growth, expansion of operating margins
Succeeds CareFusion Chairman and CEO David L. Schlotterbeck who previously announced plans to retire by Feb. 28
Feb 1, 2011


SAN DIEGO, Feb. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- CareFusion Corporation (NYSE: CFN), a global, medical technology company, announced today the appointment of Kieran T. Gallahue as chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding David L. Schlotterbeck who previously announced plans to retire later this month.
A seasoned medical-technology executive, Mr. Gallahue, 47, was most recently president and CEO of ResMed (NYSE: RMD), a global leader in medical equipment for treating, diagnosing and managing sleep-related respiratory disorders. 
During his tenure, the company grew revenue approximately 500 percent to $1.2 billion, while expanding operating margins and increasing net income more than 20 percent annually. He built an exceptional management team and global organization that commercialized products in more than 70 countries.
Mr. Gallahue has nearly 20 years of strategic, operational and corporate management experience in the health care industry, with deep expertise in the medical technologies field. Since 2007, he has also served on the board of Volcano Corp., a developer of products for interventional cardiology.
"Kieran brings strategic, operational and public company experience to CareFusion, with a proven track record of growth – all qualities that were critical in our search process," said J. Michael Losh, presiding director of the CareFusion board. "CareFusion has ample opportunities to grow and innovate, as we execute against our near-term plans to expand margins. We see a clear path to create exponentially greater value and believe Kieran is an ideal fit to accelerate this work."
Mr. Gallahue said, "It is a rare opportunity to join a company with an end-to-end portfolio of category leading products yet with such growth potential on the top and bottom lines. I have been very impressed in my early discussions with the board and management team. While I will miss my colleagues at ResMed, I am proud of the extraordinary, market-leading company we have built there and am energized about the future at CareFusion." 
Mr. Gallahue served as president, CEO and a director of ResMed since January 2008. He joined the company in January 2003 as president and COO of the Americas, and was promoted in September 2004 to the role of ResMed's global president and chief operating officer. Prior to joining ResMed, he held positions of increasing responsibility at Nanogen, a DNA research and medical diagnostics firm, and Instrumentation Laboratory, a leader in diagnostic instruments for critical care and hemostatsis. He has also held marketing, sales and financial roles at The Procter & Gamble Company and GE.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Accounting from Rutgers University and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
