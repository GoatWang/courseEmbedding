WTPhelan Announcements



















Newton, MASS – WTPhelan is pleased to announce the acquisition of Walter E. Cronin Insurance of Newton, MA.  The transaction is effective as of May 1, 2017.
 
Walter E. Cronin Insurance, most recently run by Walter Cronin, was located at 959 Watertown Street and founded in 1947. Mr. Cronin made the decision to retire from the insurance industry and selected WTPhelan as the most viable local agency for the sale.  Walter felt that the Phelan Agency would provide a seamless transition for his valued customers and will serve as a consultant going forward.
 
Insurance customers of Walter E. Cronin Insurance will have their policies handled in Phelan’s Watertown office located at 145 Main Street.  “At WTPhelan, we are committed to providing exceptional service, and we are honored that Mr. Cronin has entrusted our agency to take care of his customers” said Robert Ramsey, the Agency’s Vice President.   “We are delighted to welcome Walter’s customers to WTPhelan, and are confident that we will provide them with the same level of integrity and care they have received from the Cronin family over the past 70 years.”
