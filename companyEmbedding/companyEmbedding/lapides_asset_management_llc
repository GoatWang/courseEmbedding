ABOUT US

 

Lapides
Asset Management was founded in June of 2005 by Steve Wilson, former Chief
Investment Officer of the Capital Management Group of Reich & Tang, a New York
City-based value investment manager. Steve has since been joined by a number of
like-minded professionals who share his passion for Lapides' research-intensive
investment process. We are committed to building a firm the same way we build
our client portfolios - thoughtfully, over time, and from the bottom up.
We
are value investors specializing in investing in the securities of smaller
companies. By smaller we mean companies whose market capitalizations are
defined as mid, small and micro. Our investable range is approximately $50
million to $10 billion in market capitalization at the time of initial
purchase, which we then segment by product. Securities in the various funds may
exceed or fall below these ranges as a result of appreciation or depreciation and
will not necessarily be sold when outside the stated average market cap range.  At times, there may be add on purchases while
the companies are outside the market cap range, but no initial purchase will be
made in a company that is outside the market cap range.
For
Separate Accounts, the specific market cap range is agreed upon by each client.  A Separate Account has the ability to opt-in
at current prices, even if the companies exceed the market cap range.
We
are a single strategy firm, offering one investment process segmented into
Micro Cap, Concentrated, Small Cap and Small/Mid Cap products. Offerings are
managed in commingled limited partnerships or separate accounts, depending upon
account size and client preference.
Our
proven approach to value investing focuses on high quality businesses that -
for whatever reason - have disappointed shareholders, fallen out of favor, or
become misunderstood. We believe our edge comes from our proprietary, in-depth
research. Our unwavering commitment to our clients is to know our companies
better than anyone else. Our research is global in nature - taking us around
the world to better understand all aspects of the businesses of our portfolio
investments. 
Our
ultimate goal is to capture unrecognized meaningful change in a company before
that change is widely understood and appreciated - and certainly before it is
priced into the company's shares. We sell when the market gets more
enthusiastic than we are about a company's stock, often after a recovery in
operating fundamentals and subsequent multiple expansion. In this way, equities
we buy as value investments are often sold to growth-oriented investors,
hopefully at much higher valuations.

Investment Process | Lapides Asset Management





 
 

 













 
 
 
 
 
 






INVESTMENT PROCESS

 









At
Lapides Asset Management, our goal is to generate a meaningful absolute
return within an attractive overall risk profile for our clients. If
our investment philosophy is the strategic basis for making
investments, it follows that our investment process defines the tactics
that lead toward a purchase. As we move through this process, we first discover a suitable candidate, then understand its business and products, in order to best value its worth. Only when the reward for the risk taken is significantly attractive will we purchase shares. Once the investment is in our portfolio, we continually monitor our original thesis, and ultimately sell
- hopefully at a significant gain. Importantly, a strong appreciation
for minimizing risk underlies everything we do. Our aim is to find for
our clients' portfolios the right companies at the right time at the
right price. Please click below to read more on each step.

Prospect Idea



We
acquire our information directly and unfiltered, then combine it with
our knowledge of underlying industry dynamics. The cumulative and
generalist nature of our research team's experience is key to our
ability to connect the many dots.
Through
comprehensive on-site visits and exhaustive, in-depth interviews with
companies all over the world, we develop a deeper understanding of
potentially attractive investments. For us, a typical site visit to a
company provides not only intelligence on a firm; it also provides an
opportunity to learn about a company's distributors, vendors,
competitors, and customers. 
A
skilled analyst is always prospecting - searching far and wide. Good
ideas can come from anywhere. In fact, it's almost easier to say where
our ideas do not come from: the brokerage community or from screening financial databases. 
Our
objective is to find good companies that - for some temporary,
identifiable and correctable reason - have a discounted valuation in
the marketplace. Under the right leadership, performance and perception
can materially improve. Buying our investments when they are out of
favor allows us to bridge the gap between a company's current value and
where it should be valued - the profitable transition over time from hidden gem into coveted jewel.


top


Measure Value



Each
of our investments must have a discount valuation and financial
flexibility within the context of meaningful - however unrecognized -
internal change. 
Our
valuation process begins with traditional metrics such as the
price-to-earnings ratio, enterprise value to EBITDA, and free cash flow
analysis. Importantly, our valuations are based on long-term operating
metrics and are measured against comparables. We are nevertheless aware
of the limits of assumptions in mathematical calculations, so judgment
and experience always trump a strictly formulaic approach. 
Financial
flexibility is having the wherewithal to achieve the long-term
strategic objectives that we believe are critical to reaching our
investment premise. During this phase of the investment process,
determining whether or not a company has financial flexibility and is
trading at a sufficient discount is essential before proceeding. 



top


Build Mosaic


Our
process has always been differentiated by its research-intensive
nature. The ancients built their mosaics by piecing together many small
stones to create a picture. Our research methodology is likewise
hands-on, time-consuming and enhanced by our investment team's decades
of experience researching companies around the globe. We build our
mosaics out of small pebbles of information - some picked up right off
the ground while many more are buried deep beneath the surface. 
To
be successful in an investment, an investor must have an edge in
information or an edge in perspective. We buy a stock when we believe
we have that edge. Again, each Lapides investment must have a discount
valuation and financial flexibility within the context of meaningful -
however unrecognized - internal change. An understanding of that
meaningful change is the picture our research mosaics yield.



top


Monitor Thesis



Monitoring
our thesis takes many different forms, but we believe the real work
begins once the first share is purchased, when we intensify the process
of substantiating our thesis and continually evaluating its validity.
This part of the process goes on for as long as we own a company's
securities, and even after, as we may own a stock more than once. Our
thesis must withstand rigorous scrutiny during the holding period. We
spend a great deal of time discussing issues and conditions with
persons deeply involved in the company or industry: line and staff
executives, other current and former employees, customers, competitors,
distributors, vendors and anyone else in a position to evaluate the
company's strategies and capabilities.
Importantly, we have the discipline to reappraise or readjust for significant events and changing environments.



top


Sell Appropriately



Before
determining whether it is appropriate to sell a company's stock, we
believe one must have a clear idea of why it was bought in the first
place, underscoring the importance of building the mosaic and
monitoring our original thesis. 
Our sell
discipline embodies balancing our expectations and the original thesis
against the relative size of the position in the portfolio. If the
company's stock price fully reflects the impact of the meaningful
internal change that was the original basis for our investment, the
position is sold. We also sell when the markets become much more
enthusiastic about our holding than we are - and that heightened
enthusiasm is reflected in the valuation. Of course, if we recognize
that we have made a mistake in our initial analysis or if significant
events alter the potential housed in our thesis, we will also sell. 
We
approach our sell discipline with an acute sensitivity to other
investors' expectations, knowing that their ever-changing perspectives
compel us to manage our positions proactively. We are fully aware that
selling appropriately involves balancing the concept of "leaving money
on the table" against the knowledge that risk escalates with a rising
valuation. Just as we accumulate our holdings in stages, we typically
"average out" when selling. Our cash position is a residual of the
process.



top


Risk Management


We
manage risk every step of the way.  When prospecting for
opportunities, we must be able to understand the business.  When
valuing companies, we are extremely sensitive to our assumptions,
trying to consider everything that can go wrong.  By combining our
deep understanding with our conviction in a company, and by buying that
company's equity at a meaningful discount to its potential value, we
seek to limit our downside considerably (thus preserving capital and
creating the opportunity for meaningful upside). We also create the
ability to further enhance our over-all risk/reward profile by
"averaging down", purchasing more of a company's stock when the firm's
stock price falls.  Always conscious of the price impact of a sale
at market, we are patient sellers, and we tend to "average out" over
time.

            Lapides Asset Management was founded in June of 2005 by Steve Wilson, former Chief Investment Officer of the Capital Management Group of Reich & Tang, a New York City-based value investment manager. Steve has since been joined by a number of like-minded professionals who share his passion for Lapides' research-intensive investment process. We are committed to building a firm the same way we build our client portfolios - thoughtfully, over time, and from the bottom up. We are value investors specializing in investing in the securities of smaller companies. By smaller we mean companies whose market capitalization is defined as mid, small and micro. The investable range is $50 million to $10 billion in market capitalization, which we then segment by product. We are a single strategy firm, offering one investment process segregated into Micro Value, Concentrated Smaller Value, and Focused Small/Mid Value products. Each offering is managed in commingled limited partnerships or separate accounts, depending upon account size and client preference. Our proven approach to value investing focuses on higher quality businesses that - for whatever reason - have disappointed shareholders, fallen out of favor, or become misunderstood. Our edge is our knowledge about our investments. Our unwavering commitment to our clients and their advisors is to know our companies better than anyone else. Our research is global in nature - taking us around the world to better understand the underlying businesses that comprise these corporations. Our ultimate goal is to capture unrecognized meaningful change in a company before that change is either widely understood or appreciated - and certainly before it is priced into the company's shares. We sell when the market gets more enthusiastic than we are about a company's stock, often after a recovery in operating fundamentals and subsequent multiple expansion. In this way, equities we buy as value investments are often sold to growth-oriented investors, hopefully at much higher valuations.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
