	    Meet Stacey Walker  |  Stacey Walker for Supervisor	  










































 



Meet Stacey Walker

Born and raised in Cedar Rapids, Stacey Walker feels a personal commitment to make Linn County a safe, healthy and prosperous place for all its families.
At age four, Stacey lost his mother in an unsolved homicide case. He was taken in by his grandmother – Shirley Martin – who would raise him and his sister. She left her job as a nurse’s aide to raise them as a single parent on the southeast side of Cedar Rapids, an experience that taught Stacey about resilience and hard work.
A product of public schools and the Boys and Girls Club of Cedar Rapids, Stacey understands firsthand how the government, non-profit and private sectors can collaborate to foster opportunities for all children.
In 2010, Stacey helped launch the LBA Foundation, a Cedar Rapids non-profit that helps middle and high school students stay on track to graduate.
He then moved to Washington, D.C., to assist AOL Founder Steve Case and philanthropist Jean Case in their efforts to reinvigorate America’s entrepreneurial ecosystem at the Case Foundation, a philanthropic non-profit that “invests in people and ideas that can change the world.”
Stacey also assisted J. Douglas Holladay, Special Ambassador to South Africa, in teaching master’s-level students at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University.
Prior to being elected to the Linn County Board of Supervisors – as the first African American to ever hold the position – Stacey served as the Chief of Staff for Patel Endeavors and Hawkeye Hotels. In this role, he helped execute on growth and development strategy while also managing communications for the company and its subsidiaries. Through his involvement with Patel Endeavors, he has worked alongside the principals of Built By Iowa, a private equity firm that focuses on mentoring and growing Iowa-based startups.
Through this work, he had the opportunity to meet business-owners, entrepreneurs and investors across Iowa and learn about a range of industries, from agriculture to clean energy to health care.
Throughout his career, Walker has served on political campaigns at the congressional, gubernatorial and presidential level.
Walker served as Co-chair of the Safe, Equitable, and Thriving Communities Task Force, a multi-jurisdictional partnership between the City of Cedar Rapids, the Cedar Rapids School District, and Linn County to address systemic poverty and gun violence among other priorities. He serves as a trustee to the Cedar Rapids Community Schools Foundation and is a board member to the Academy for Scholastic and Personal Success and NewBo City Market. In addition to serving as the county’s legislative liaison to Iowa’s General Assembly, he serves on the Board of Directors for the Linn County Public Health Department, the Public Art Commission, the Workforce Development CEO Board, and the Large Investor Board of the Cedar Rapids Metro Economic Alliance.
