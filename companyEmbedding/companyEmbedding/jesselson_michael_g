Job Details
               LBiQ is a quarterly print publication from global marketing and technology agency LBi, running since December 2007. This blog maintains the full archive of the thought leadership content generated both by LBi and by our friends, network external contributors. It's also here to provide a window on life at LBi and to offer responsive commentary on relevant issues more frequently than a quarterly print format can allow for. Needless to say, if you or a company you work with feel that you're being misrepresented in any of the content on this site then please get in touch immediately, and we'll make any necessary changes. Likewise, if you'd like to go on the mailing list for the print version, or to write something for us then just drop us a line. The contact details on this blog are the corporate ones for LBi, so you'll probably find it easier to write to editorial at LBiQ dot net.
