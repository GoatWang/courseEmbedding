BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

This is a guest blog post by Ryan Carey, of My 3 Quotes.
How important is a well-known name brand for you? That is a big question and the answer greatly affects our buying decisions. For example, when several in-home window presentations by high-pressure salespeople are giving you a headache, do you get generic ibuprofen or do you pay a little extra for Advil? The generic brand shows the same percentage of ingredients, but this is a huge headache so maybe its best to be on the safe side?
Over the years, the most common question I get is, "So how does this window compare against Andersen, Marvin, or Pella?" I could show the comparable ingredients or the same U-factors, but some folks are just more comfortable with that well-known name brand. They know the manufacturer has been around for a long time and therefore has made many customers happy. They are also concerned about the company being around in the future for warranty issues.
If you read Window Replacement: Part 1, you know how important I believe that U-factors are in new windows. In Part 2, I went through the pros and cons of different window materials and install methods. For Part 3, we will focus on the Big 3: Marvin, Andersen, and Pella. I will even add a 3.5 for Weather Shield. You won't normally hear unbiased opinions on these windows, because typically the person doing the writing has a particular window they are trying to sell.
To begin on the straight talk, I just want to say every one of these companies' windows were pretty awful in the 70's, 80's, and even into the 90's before Low E, Argon filled glass came along. This had not as much to do with them, as it did with the struggle of finding a wood interior window that worked with the new technology of double pane glass and aluminum spacers. EVERY company had issues with that. Hardwood was no longer being used for windows; it was mostly soft, quick-growth pine. The two panes of clear glass were separated by an aluminum spacer on the perimeter, which transferred in the cold from the outside because the aluminum is very conductive. That area would develop condensation, freeze, thaw, and destroy the wood where it meets the glass. Sometimes the water got into the frame and completely rotted it out.
I kept running into the same thing with homeowners. If their windows from that era were Marvin, they hated Marvin and would never use them again. If they had Andersen, they hated Andersen and would never use them again. If they had Pella or Weather Shield, well, you can guess. This is why you will find a lot of negative reviews about every kind of window out there. Unless the homeowner had very good humidity control, the customer was in for trouble with wood windows from that era in our state. Many negative reviews also were the result of bad installs.
Times have changed; spacers have changed to less conductive stainless steel, U-shaped tin steel, and foam polymers (my personal favorite-virtually no conduction of cold). Low-E and Argon glass has also hindered temperature transfer and greatly cut down UV rays that help damage the wood. While the performances have greatly improved and the wood will last longer, I still refuse to put a real wood window with any type of metal spacer in my house. Even if it is just a little maintenance from time to time with some steel wool and varnish, it is more than I want to do. Many people love real wood and feel different than me on that topic.
Times have also changed with the window market. Back in the day, these big window brands were mainly new construction, and none of them used to custom size for remodel openings. Times were so good they would actually tell customers, "YOU alter YOUR openings to fit OUR windows." Needless to say, they have all jumped headlong into the custom-sized replacement window market at this point.
MARVIN:
It shouldn't be a surprise that Marvin and Andersen are the most asked for windows from customers, considering both companies reside here in Minnesota. Pella (Iowa) and Weather Shield (Wisconsin) are a ways back in the second tier. Maybe its the thought of Hawkeye, Badger, or Packer fans making windows for your house? While people do like to buy from home state companies, the window quality and reputation certainly play their roles, as well. 
Marvin has been making windows since the 20's and they have changed along with the times. Their original double pane wood window is clad with aluminum on the exterior. They have also gone to fiberglass on the exterior with their Integrity line (real wood interior) and they make Infinity, an all-fiberglass line that has an option for a stainable interior (not real wood). Marvin is the one company out of all mentioned that have completely refused to use vinyl in any window line, so they pitch strongly against it. Their Ultimate Double Hung is a beautiful window and the price reflects it. 
I'm a big fan of Marvin; I believe in the craftsmanship of their entire product line. If I had to choose one of their windows, I would go for Infinity. Fiberglass is as good as it gets; couple it with their Everwood interior for the look and stainability of wood without actually having to worry about wood decay and you have me sold. It is definitely on the high end of pricing, as you would expect from a high-end option. My only regret with Marvin is that they still use metal spacers, which keeps me from recommending their real-wood lines. ANDERSEN: 
Andersen is the only company of the ones we're discussing that uses wood wrapped in vinyl on the exterior. The wood strengthens the vinyl, leaving an exterior that is low maintenance yet rigid. Andersen's top line, the 400 series, is high-end priced as well. I would take a Marvin over Andersen in the double hung department (I like the traditional look), but I would take the Andersen casement over a real-wood Marvin. They wrap the entire sash (the part that cranks out) in vinyl so there is no trouble spot of wood against glass. You do see the outline of vinyl on the interior, but the profile is narrow enough that most people don't mind. It's well worth it to avoid the potential wood decay. Andersen also makes an all vinyl wrapped patio door in their PermaShield line if you want to avoid exposed wood on the interior. 
So what about Andersen Renewal? Talk about a company that advertises everywhere! Renewal by Andersen is it's own company, separate but obviously owned by the main company. Renewal products are made from a composite material called Fibrex, which is part wood and part vinyl. This is very smart by Andersen, as they use up all the by-products of their other lines (which are made of wood and vinyl separately). Renewal products are not available to contractors like their other lines; you must purchase the install straight from Renewal. They feature a more rounded, contemporary look and customers I've ran across have been very positive on the product in their home. They offer stainable interiors or the low-maintenance Fibrex. With pricing being quite high-end, always remember this: NEVER tell a salesperson from another company that you're also getting a quote from Renewal, even if you are. Almost every salesperson knows where Renewal is priced, so this tells them they can price their own product higher than normal yet still be less than Renewal. Just tell them you are getting several quotes and leave it at that.  

Andersen 100 series is a very intriguing window line. Some call it "Renewal Lite" since it is also made of Fibrex. The only option is a white interior, so that takes some people out of the mix right off the bat. However, if white on the inside is OK by you, this is the absolute best opportunity to get a big name window at a no-name window price. I love their sliders and casements. The one caveat is their single-hung; that thing is a nightmare. Since the top sash is stationary, it is called a single hung (not a double hung). That's not the problem. The problem is it doesn't have the typical tilt-out feature for cleaning; it has a metal peg that you flip out before lifting the sash up. When the sash goes up, the peg should push the sash out of the frame for cleaning but many times the peg flies out instead. If you don't need to clean from the inside, then don't worry about it. If you do, stick with the sliders and casements and you'll get a great value. 
PELLA: 
Well, Pella certainly took a "we're not fooling around" approach to jumping into the remodel market. They make three series of wood windows with aluminum cladding, a fiberglass line, and three levels of all vinyl windows! On the vinyl side, they can be judged right along with other vinyl windows with the bonus that they carry the Pella name. My advice remains the same as with other vinyl-check the U-Value, stick with the top level they offer, and you'll be happy. They also make an all-fiberglass window in Impervia, with solid color interiors available.  
Pella makes a finely detailed wood line called the Architectural Series, which is a well-crafted window with a higher price tag. Their Designer Series is option-friendly, and one of the only lines that has really perfected the "blinds between the glass panes" option. If you want blinds in your glass instead of on the inside of your home, this is the best line for you. Pella's entry level wood window is Proline, which I am not a fan of whatsoever. A small space between the glass along with an aluminum spacer means bad news for the wood. I've seen these windows in tough shape after ten years, even with the Low E glass. If you like Pella and want wood interior, pay the extra for Architectural or Designer. 
I also have to bring up Pella's patio door lines. They are well-made, but they are the only company I've ever seen that puts the patio screen on the inside, not the outside. They say this protects the abuse of an exterior track and they put a nice wood finish on the screen, but it is impractical for its main use- keeping bugs out. Imagine a summer night where you have 200 mosquitoes on your screen, thirsting for your blood like a pack of zombies. When its time for bed, you have to open the screen to close the outside panel of the patio door, then quick close the screen again so they don't all get in. Now they are all trapped between the two panels. I'll never get that design. 
WEATHER SHIELD:   
Why am I bringing up Weather Shield? Not exactly a big name compared to the other three with the big advertising budgets. However, I bring them up because they have embraced the foam spacer technology while the others haven't. I mentioned I wouldn't put a wood window with a metal spacer in my house. Well, here is a well-made wood window with a foam spacer. For someone who despises even a little maintenance on windows, I personally would still avoid wood. However, if I had to do real wood, I would use Weather Shield Aluminum clad wood windows with the foam spacer in my house. No metal equals less condensation where the glass meets the wood. Weather Shield also makes wood windows with vinyl and fiberglass exteriors, but I am not a huge fan of the overall design of those two products. Their bread and butter is the aluminum-clad, and I would recommend that window to anyone who wants to stick with real wood. 
So, that is my opinion on some of the pros and cons of the big 3 plus 1 (Weather Shield). I hope you find it helpful. If you want more detail or have more questions on any exterior product, I am available by phone or e-mail.  Contact information is on our website below.  Next time we will explore the storm damage insurance process- what to look for and what to avoid at all costs!

Avoid Marvin Integrity and possibly the Company


gjhSeptember 15, 2010 


I just bought a house full of Marvin Integrity (fiberglass) windows and they are horrible. The doors barely roll and the sliders bind and drag through the entire travel. The sales rep tried one window that my wife can barely move and he said it was "normal" and told me that these are a "low-end" window, but certainly not a low-end price. Marvin is apparently willing shovel manure and call it service. Avoid these windows and probably the entire Company.

millworkman Something does not sound right here, no way in hell a Marvin salesman would tell you they are a "low-end" window, because they are not and I assume your telling me they are installed properly as this sounds like an installation issue to me.

amber_windows I agree that this issues sound like they are related to installation. You need to contact the local Marvin Distributor for your area to inspect. If you are in the West. U.S. that's me.

friedajune I could be wrong, but this sort of post, or the OP, sounds like "troll" to me. Perhaps written by someone who is selling a Marvin competitor, and getting whupped by Marvin? The person posted same day as signing up to the Forum, gave very little information, never came back to respond to the other posters, and related a very un-typical response by a Marvin sales rep. I guess just something about the tone sounds askew or wonky to me.

skydawggy I never take the "one post and run" posters seriously. They are generally either competitors tired of losing sales to Marvin or someone with an ax to grind for some hazy reasoning. Notice how the poster in this case didn't stick around to answer any questions and hasn't responded since the original "drive by" post?

desertwest Not sure about the "integrity" of the poster but I have to chime in here because the Marvin rep here is doing something sneaky in my opinion.
I live at 7000 ft and was interested in windows that qualify for the tax credit. In order to qualify these Marvin windows need argon. I noticed on their warranty that it is voided if windows are installed at >5000 ft without breather tubes. You can't have argon gas AND breather tubes as the argon leaks out immediately! I pointed this out and he said so I would still qualify for the tax credit they'd make an exception for my warranty. So he wants to sell me argon and no breather tubes. But if their warranty notes this issue then there must be a good reason for breather tubes at > 5000ft!

amber_windows There is a very good reason for the breather tubes, and that is so that your units do not combust from the altitude. When the new tax rebates were brought about, there were areas that were going to be a challenge due to the issue of altitude. The peramiters of the tax rebate left a good portion of manufacturers scrambling to ensure that they could compete in markets such as Colorado where universally cap tubes have always been a standard.Marvin, as well as, many others have changed some of the guidelines through additional tests so that more consumers in these areas qualify. This qualification is based on a number of factors such as the altitude, and the type of units you are ordering. Although 7000 feet is above what I believe may be a qualified project, your dealer would be the best option to discuss this with. They can submit your project for approval from Marvin.There is a specific link to tax rebate information on the Marvin website at www.marvin.com. If you are still unsure then please call in. We are glad to discuss your options.

I have Marvin windows and chose this company because of their excellent reputation. Good windows and great people to work with.

lcsanjose Good luck on follow up service issues. If you don't buy from a shop that services what they sell you usually wait months for help from Marvin. Integrity is crap to me it is low end and the warranty isn't worth the paper its written on, we installed them in a small cottage we built and ended up removing them ..to many issues overall for what you pay ..there are alot better windows out there for the price...

East Bay 10 lcsanjose - I really don't understand your post(s). You have bashed Integrity and Pella among others with nothing positive offered. As for the service that Integrity offers it is some of the best in the industry and is a "bullet proof" window. As for installing in a small cottage and then pulling them out, I would like to see pictures. I doubt we will hear from you again.

amber_windows eastbay10 - Thank You! My company does not represent the Integrity Line in N. Ca., but we do in S. Ca. and several other States. We work diligently to represent the homeowner in a fair and timely manner.
lcsanjose - I am sorry that you had the experience that you did, but please understand that there are many factors that can attribute to the product not functioning to the homeowners expectations, and that unfortunately are not the fault of the manufacturer. Not having intimate knowledge of your situation, I am not going to assume that this was the case. If you would like to post the circumstances I would be happy to discuss it with you.

friedajune Typically when someone signs up for the forum the same day they rant, as Lcsanjose did in this thread, and that rant is not seeking advice, or asking a question, or indicating any expectation for a response, it's a troll, a fake. Another tipoff - no information about the complaint. When someone is telling a true story, they don't just say their windows had "issues" as Lcsanjose did; people with true problems provide some details. Just ignore Lcsanjose's post.

sum_ting_wong Hi Amber,Not trying to hijack this thread, but can you recommend any Marvin dealers in the San Diego area? I'm tired of the high quotes until a mgr is called, or not being given an exact price until...happens, etc.
I've done months of research, and keep finding disappointment in the reps I've encountered to date.
Thanks! Signed, not bitter, just frustrated, lol.

gjharkin_gmail_com No, I am not a troll. I bought the windows, and in spite of being told by the installer and the customer rep that the windows are the problem, they are not. It was an installation problem from day 1. I managed to get the dealer/installer out to fix some of them by stopping payment on the check, but two were damaged by their install procedures. Three months later I have just purchased two new windows and had them installed. The fight continues over who pays. Unfortunately, Marvin Integrity has actively worked on behalf of the Dealer to get me to pay him without getting my windows fixed.

skydawggy So you started out blaming Marvin, the company that made the windows and now you admit the windows are fine, it's a problem with the independent installer due to a poor installation. How is this Marvins fault?

gjh I didn't realize this might attract others. I would say that the Integrity windows are decent, comparable to the Pella fiberglass, maybe a bit better. Definitely better than the Anderson composites. Little noise or air intrusion and the sliding mechanism is acceptable.
I was told by the Marvin representative that the problems were with the windows themselves, not the installation. In his own words, "these are a low end window." I don't think that is true. Marvin, like Pella and Anderson, are more expensive, but I'm not going to say they are over-priced. If I had it to do over again, I would buy Integrity or Pella.
I spent quite a bit of time and money undoing the disaster created by the dealer/installer and I got no help from Marvin Windows. So be sure the installer is good and expect nothing from Marvin Windows once they leave the factory.

HomeSealed Your newest post sounds quite a bit different from the first one. You mention that the dealer/installer was the cause for this disaster, so it would seem unreasonable to expect that the manufacturer would take responsibility for that. You wouldn't complain about the farm if you get a bad steak at a restaurant, right?In my dealings with Marvin, their service after the sale is very good, and one of the best that I've seen. Ultimately though, your final advice is good: Be sure to choose a good installer. The installer/dealer is the entity that you as a consumer are dealing with, so this choice is of paramount importance to make sure your project goes smoothly.

Straight A Builders, Inc. We install Marvin and Integrity windows and have had great success and customer satisfaction.  Even the best window money can buy will fail with a poor installation.  I hardly ever deal with Marvin reps because the product is that good, but when needed for minor hardware issues they have been very responsive and helpful.

QWD-Christian We are a dealer and have not sold Marvin in a long time but recently picked up this line to have a fiberglass option. We never would have if we didnt believe in the product. We didnt however pick up any of their other product lines. Who you buy from is very important and who installs the product is equally important .
