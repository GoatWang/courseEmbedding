Design to Silicon Traditional EDA tools for physical design and verification have reached limits due to greater manufacturing process variability and the growing size and complexity of designs that take advantage of the latest nanometer scaling. With the advent of new process technologies, the handoff between integrated circuit (IC) layout and manufacturing has changed from a simple check to a multi-step process where the layout design must be enhanced to ensure efficient manufacturing. This presents a host of challenges related to manufacturing process effects, photolithography, data volumes, and achieving a cost-effective yield of finished chips from each wafer.
To meet these challenges with confidence, design teams turn to Mentor's  Olympus-SoC™ place and route system with Multi-Corner-Multi-Mode timing analysis and DFM-aware layout optimization for rapid closure of physical designs. The Olympus-SoC system works with the industry-leading integrated Calibre® design-to-silicon platform, which includes physical verification, full-chip, transistor-level parasitic extraction, model-based design for manufacturability (DFM) solutions, mask data preparation (MDP) and resolution enhancement technologies (RET), such as optical proximity correction and other computational lithography techniques. The Calibre product family efficiently and accurately manages every facet of the design-to-silicon transition.
The Mentor Tessent™ product suite is a comprehensive silicon test and yield analysis platform that addresses the challenges of manufacturing test, debug, and yield ramp for today’s SoCs. Built on the foundation of the best-in-class solutions for each test discipline, Tessent brings them together in a powerful test flow that ensures total chip coverage.
Tanner EDA by Mentor is an integrated, affordable and intuitive product suite for the design, layout and verification of analog/mixed signal (AMS) and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) ICs. Used by more than 25,000 designers around the world, Tanner tools support an end-to-end flow: top-down, mixed-signal design capture and simulation; synthesis with DFT support; physical design; place-and-route; and “sign-off ready” timing analysis to tape-out.


Functional Verification Mentor provides its customers with critical tools for solving the increasingly complicated problems of verifying that today’s complex chip designs actually function as intended. Functional errors at the system level are the leading cause of design revisions affecting time to market and profitability. Design teams must improve existing methodologies with tools that scale across design complexity and multiple levels of abstraction.
Mentor is transforming verification with new use models and a collection of best-in-class technologies and methodologies. From block-level simulation to full system-level design emulation, the Mentor Enterprise Verification Platform™ (EVP) boosts productivity in ASIC and SoC functional verification by combining advanced verification technologies in a comprehensive platform.
The Mentor EVP combines Questa® Verification Platform, the Veloce® Emulation Platform, and the Visualizer™ debug environment into a high-performance, datacenter resource. Mentor EVP features global resource management that supports project teams around the world, maximizing both user productivity and total verification return on investment.
The Veloce Emulation Platform uses innovative software, running on powerful, qualified hardware and an extensible operating system, to target design risks faster than hardware-centric strategies. Now considered among the most versatile and powerful of verification tools, project teams use emulation for hardware debugging, hardware/software co-verification or integration, system-level prototyping, low-power verification and power estimation and performance characterization.
The Questa Verification Platform is the most comprehensive EDA solution for functional verification, merging standards support, tools and a “design for verification” methodology to minimize verification cycles and design revisions. This solution provides the most complete path to verification closure, including integrated technologies and methodologies such as advanced TLM and UVM testbenches, assertions, formal, and verification IP.


Integrated PCB-FPGA Systems Design As ICs, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) become more complex and printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technology advances to include embedded components and high-density interconnect layers, the design of PCBs is reaching new levels of complexity. These are frequently a source of design bottlenecks.
Mentor is the market and technology leader in PCB design, providing many of the world’s largest system design companies today with a range of scalable design solutions to reduce the time, cost and risk of electronic system design: Xpedition™ Enterprise, for the creation of today’s most complex PCB designs; Board Station® XE, the market standard solution for the PCB design challenges of the global enterprise; and the PADS® flow, the leading Windows-based solution for complex PCB design.
Mentor also offers solutions for specific design challenges such as radio frequency (RF) design management, and verification advanced packaging, concurrent team design, FPGA-on-board integration and design data management.


Electronic System Level (ESL) Design Design complexity of next-generation digital applications is outgrowing the capabilities of current design methods. Increasingly, designs are large systems that include embedded cores, IP, and complex signal processing hardware that implements computationally intensive algorithms.
To deal with this complexity, Mentor offers the EDA industry’s most comprehensive suite of electronic system level (ESL) design tools for hardware creation. Vista™, a SystemC debug environment, helps designers model their designs at a higher level of abstraction where they can identify and resolve problems with minimal effort.
For system integration, Visual Elite™ helps designers deal with IP from different sources, modeled in different languages, and written at different levels of abstraction. Together these tools deliver dramatic productivity and design quality improvements, and provide a methodology that will satisfy designers’ requirements for the next 10-15 years.
 


RTL Synthesis Traditional hardware design methods that require manual RTL development and debugging are too time-consuming and error-prone for today’s complex designs. Mentor Catapult® and PowerPro® products automate creation of fully-verified, power-optimized RTL for downstream synthesis and physical design. With the Catapult High-Level Synthesis Platform, designers use industry-standard ANSI C++ and SystemC to describe functional intent at a high level of abstraction and then generate production-quality RTL. The PowerPro RTL Low-Power Platform provides a complete solution to accurately measure RTL power consumption and then interactively explore and thoroughly optimize power expenditure during the RTL development cycle.


Automotive EE Design Solutions A new car now contains 15 percent more electronics than the models of one year ago, in entertainment, navigation and safety systems. As the electrical wiring systems in the transportation industry become increasingly complex, so the need for software solutions to manage this complexity grows.
Mentor offers an unrivalled range of leading-edge solutions being used by OEMs and wire harness manufacturers throughout the world. Mentor's Capital tool is a powerful design environment developed specifically for the wire harness industry, providing a data-centric tool suite for electrical systems and associated harness design. Mentor's Volcano™ product line supports a structured engineering process for the development of distributed control systems.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

Design to Silicon Traditional EDA tools for physical design and verification have reached limits due to greater manufacturing process variability and the growing size and complexity of designs that take advantage of the latest nanometer scaling. With the advent of new process technologies, the handoff between integrated circuit (IC) layout and manufacturing has changed from a simple check to a multi-step process where the layout design must be enhanced to ensure efficient manufacturing. This presents a host of challenges related to manufacturing process effects, photolithography, data volumes, and achieving a cost-effective yield of finished chips from each wafer.
To meet these challenges with confidence, design teams turn to Mentor's  Olympus-SoC™ place and route system with Multi-Corner-Multi-Mode timing analysis and DFM-aware layout optimization for rapid closure of physical designs. The Olympus-SoC system works with the industry-leading integrated Calibre® design-to-silicon platform, which includes physical verification, full-chip, transistor-level parasitic extraction, model-based design for manufacturability (DFM) solutions, mask data preparation (MDP) and resolution enhancement technologies (RET), such as optical proximity correction and other computational lithography techniques. The Calibre product family efficiently and accurately manages every facet of the design-to-silicon transition.
The Mentor Tessent™ product suite is a comprehensive silicon test and yield analysis platform that addresses the challenges of manufacturing test, debug, and yield ramp for today’s SoCs. Built on the foundation of the best-in-class solutions for each test discipline, Tessent brings them together in a powerful test flow that ensures total chip coverage.
Tanner EDA by Mentor is an integrated, affordable and intuitive product suite for the design, layout and verification of analog/mixed signal (AMS) and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) ICs. Used by more than 25,000 designers around the world, Tanner tools support an end-to-end flow: top-down, mixed-signal design capture and simulation; synthesis with DFT support; physical design; place-and-route; and “sign-off ready” timing analysis to tape-out.


Functional Verification Mentor provides its customers with critical tools for solving the increasingly complicated problems of verifying that today’s complex chip designs actually function as intended. Functional errors at the system level are the leading cause of design revisions affecting time to market and profitability. Design teams must improve existing methodologies with tools that scale across design complexity and multiple levels of abstraction.
Mentor is transforming verification with new use models and a collection of best-in-class technologies and methodologies. From block-level simulation to full system-level design emulation, the Mentor Enterprise Verification Platform™ (EVP) boosts productivity in ASIC and SoC functional verification by combining advanced verification technologies in a comprehensive platform.
The Mentor EVP combines Questa® Verification Platform, the Veloce® Emulation Platform, and the Visualizer™ debug environment into a high-performance, datacenter resource. Mentor EVP features global resource management that supports project teams around the world, maximizing both user productivity and total verification return on investment.
The Veloce Emulation Platform uses innovative software, running on powerful, qualified hardware and an extensible operating system, to target design risks faster than hardware-centric strategies. Now considered among the most versatile and powerful of verification tools, project teams use emulation for hardware debugging, hardware/software co-verification or integration, system-level prototyping, low-power verification and power estimation and performance characterization.
The Questa Verification Platform is the most comprehensive EDA solution for functional verification, merging standards support, tools and a “design for verification” methodology to minimize verification cycles and design revisions. This solution provides the most complete path to verification closure, including integrated technologies and methodologies such as advanced TLM and UVM testbenches, assertions, formal, and verification IP.


Integrated PCB-FPGA Systems Design As ICs, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) become more complex and printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication technology advances to include embedded components and high-density interconnect layers, the design of PCBs is reaching new levels of complexity. These are frequently a source of design bottlenecks.
Mentor is the market and technology leader in PCB design, providing many of the world’s largest system design companies today with a range of scalable design solutions to reduce the time, cost and risk of electronic system design: Xpedition™ Enterprise, for the creation of today’s most complex PCB designs; Board Station® XE, the market standard solution for the PCB design challenges of the global enterprise; and the PADS® flow, the leading Windows-based solution for complex PCB design.
Mentor also offers solutions for specific design challenges such as radio frequency (RF) design management, and verification advanced packaging, concurrent team design, FPGA-on-board integration and design data management.


Electronic System Level (ESL) Design Design complexity of next-generation digital applications is outgrowing the capabilities of current design methods. Increasingly, designs are large systems that include embedded cores, IP, and complex signal processing hardware that implements computationally intensive algorithms.
To deal with this complexity, Mentor offers the EDA industry’s most comprehensive suite of electronic system level (ESL) design tools for hardware creation. Vista™, a SystemC debug environment, helps designers model their designs at a higher level of abstraction where they can identify and resolve problems with minimal effort.
For system integration, Visual Elite™ helps designers deal with IP from different sources, modeled in different languages, and written at different levels of abstraction. Together these tools deliver dramatic productivity and design quality improvements, and provide a methodology that will satisfy designers’ requirements for the next 10-15 years.
 


RTL Synthesis Traditional hardware design methods that require manual RTL development and debugging are too time-consuming and error-prone for today’s complex designs. Mentor Catapult® and PowerPro® products automate creation of fully-verified, power-optimized RTL for downstream synthesis and physical design. With the Catapult High-Level Synthesis Platform, designers use industry-standard ANSI C++ and SystemC to describe functional intent at a high level of abstraction and then generate production-quality RTL. The PowerPro RTL Low-Power Platform provides a complete solution to accurately measure RTL power consumption and then interactively explore and thoroughly optimize power expenditure during the RTL development cycle.


Automotive EE Design Solutions A new car now contains 15 percent more electronics than the models of one year ago, in entertainment, navigation and safety systems. As the electrical wiring systems in the transportation industry become increasingly complex, so the need for software solutions to manage this complexity grows.
Mentor offers an unrivalled range of leading-edge solutions being used by OEMs and wire harness manufacturers throughout the world. Mentor's Capital tool is a powerful design environment developed specifically for the wire harness industry, providing a data-centric tool suite for electrical systems and associated harness design. Mentor's Volcano™ product line supports a structured engineering process for the development of distributed control systems.
In-vehicle software with optimized resource utilization and network design tools allow the design of robust AUTOSAR and non-AUTOSAR in-vehicle networks in a very cost - efficient way.

Frontloading CFD refers to the practice of moving CFD simulation early into the design process, enabling design engineers to examine and evaluate design options, resulting in optimized product performance and reliability. The new FloEFD product provides the industry's first simulation solution for water vapor absorption alongside several other lighting related functionalities.View photosWith Mentor Graphics FloEFD product, users can simulate complex design conditions including humidity absorption in solids within engineering timescales.MoreWith the latest version of FloEFD software, users can now simulate the sorption (when one substance permeates another) and desorption (changing from an adsorbed state to a gaseous or liquid state) processes. For example, plastic absorbs water and then releases it when environmental conditions change. This functionality is important for several key markets such as automotive lighting design where moisture needs to be minimized in light housings. Other automotive lighting related capabilities include radiation and spectrum for direction source modeling, and LED thermal-optical modeling to simulate LEDs with non-linear dependence of parameters on temperature."The engineering team at SICK AG has been using FloEFD successfully for several years" said Dr. Dirk Spreeman, project leader, presence detection department in the research and development group at SICK AG. "And now that the condensation functionality includes water vapor absorption in solids, we will be able to include simulation in the design process for our light sensors as well. To date we have been unable to access this information until after the first prototype has been built. Therefore, we are very excited about gaining insight into the design earlier when we can modify it quickly and inexpensively."While we continue to make the software faster and more efficient, the focus of FloEFD 16 is on power and the ability to handle even more complex tasks:Linked Data from Components: Often the design of complex devices assumes a multi-level simulation approach when analysis is initiated from a simple component, followed by an assembly of components, then finally the full system comprised of many components and sub-assemblies. Using the new FloEFD product, users can move from level to level, and re-use the component task definition of an assembly, saving a great amount of time by eliminating the need to repeat component or sub-assembly definition. Users simply link to a previously created project in just seconds, minimizing the risk of manual entry errors. In addition, users can create a library of components by saving model components with FloEFD conditions for future use, to be shared with other designers in the organization.Radiation and LED enhancements: the radiation modeling capability for FloEFD software has been further extended to include radiation pattern and spectrum definitions for directional sources. The LED thermal-optical model is now capable of simulating LEDs with non-linear dependency of parameters on temperature. These improvements are ideal for automotive lighting design and simulation.Transient Explorer: The new method of results data compression saves large amounts of disk space while it provides access to transient data immediately. Users can combine the transient animation of plots and parameter charts into a single view.Design of Experiment (DOE) and Optimization: True optimization of designs requires that multiple criteria be considered concurrently; as such its implementation can consume substantial resources (such as time and computing power). With the addition of this functionality now users can take advantage of DoE and Response Surface optimization.Korean localization: FloEFD is now the only CFD software with user interfaces in Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Russian, English and now Korean, allowing engineers to experience FloEFD in their preferred language."Our customers require fast and accurate simulation results for their complex engineering problems," said Roland Feldhinkel, general manager of Mentor Graphics Mechanical Analysis Division. "Our latest FloEFD product provides the power, special functionality and performance required by engineers to obtain meaningful answers to their questions without disrupting their design process."   Product Availability:The new FloEFD product is available for immediate shipment. It is the only CFD software product with user interfaces in multiple languages including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, French, German, Russian and English.

WILSONVILLE, Ore., Jan. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mentor Graphics Corporation (Nasdaq:    MENT) today announced its Tessent® DefectSim™ product was awarded 2016 Product of the Year by Electronic Products magazine. This award is presented for a product launched in 2016 that represents innovative design and advancement in technology, as determined by the editors of the publication.








The Tessent DefectSim product measures the defect coverage of any test applied to an analog or mixed-signal circuit. This tool enables a designer to improve the quality of analog and mixed-signal circuits during integrated circuit (IC) design by guiding design-for-test (DFT) and the selection of more effective manufacturing tests. It also enables test engineers to reduce test costs by showing which tests do not increase coverage and whether simpler or faster tests could achieve higher coverage. The tool satisfies the growing defect-coverage measurement requirement for automotive ICs set by Tier1 automotive suppliers in accordance with the ISO 26262 automotive functional safety standard.
The Tessent DefectSim tool works with Mentor's Eldo® and Questa® ADMS™ simulators to measure the likelihood-weighted percentage of opens, shorts, extreme variations, and user-defined defect or fault models that can be detected within a layout-extracted or schematic netlist. The Tessent DefectSim product combines many techniques, described in our peer-reviewed papers, to reduce total simulation time by many orders of magnitude compared to simulation of every potential defect in a flat layout-extracted netlist, without reducing simulation accuracy or the choice of tests.
"We are gratified to receive this industry recognition for an analysis tool that has taken many years to develop, and is the only general-purpose, analog fault simulator available commercially," said Stephen Sunter, engineering director for mixed-signal DFT at Mentor Graphics. "We thank the many customers who evaluated the Tessent DefectSim tool and provided so much constructive feedback to help ensure that their AMS designers will have the fault simulation capability that digital designers have had for 30 years and which has facilitated tremendous advances in automation for digital DFT and test generation."

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

QuestaSim is a Simulator with additional Debug capabilities targeted at complex FPGA's and SoC's. QuestaSim can be used by users who have experience with ModelSim as it shares most of the common debug features and capabilities. One of the main differences between QuestaSim and Modelsim (besides performance/capacity) is that QuestaSim is the simulation engine for the Questa Platform which includes integration of Verification Management, Formal based technologies, Questa Verification IP, Low Power Simulation and Accelerated Coverage Closure technologies. QuestaSim natively supports SystemVerilog for Testbench, UPF, UCIS, OVM/UVM where ModelSim does not.
Eldo is a SPICE simulator

FloTHERM XT is a electronics cooling CFD tool incorporating a solid modeler for manipulating MCAD parts.
FloEFD is a ‘design concurrent’ CFD tool for use in early-stage product design and is embedded within MCAD systems such as Solidworks, Creo Elements/Pro, CATIA V5 and Siemens NX


Thermal Characterization and Thermal Interface Material (TIM) Measurement equipment:

T3Ster is a hardware product that embodies an implementation of the JEDEC JESD51-1 standard for IC package thermal characterization and is compliant with JESD51-14 for Rth-JC measurement
TeraLED provides automation of the CIE 127:2007 standard providing total flux, chromaticity and correlated color temperature (CCT) for power LEDs. With T3Ster it provides thermal resistance metrics for LEDs based on the real dissipated heating power.
DynTIM extends T3Ster, providing a dynamic thermal test station for thermal conductivity measurements of thermal interface materials (TIMs), thermal greases and gap pads.


FloMASTER is a 1D or system-level CFD solution for analyzing fluid mechanics in complex pipe flow systems (from the acquisition of Flowmaster Ltd in 2012).
CADRA Design Drafting is a 2-1/2D mechanical drafting and documentation package specifically designed for drafting professionals. It provides the tools needed to develop complex drawings quickly and easily (from the acquisition of the CADRA product in 2013).



The Veloce product family enables SoC emulation and transaction-based acceleration.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

QuestaSim is a Simulator with additional Debug capabilities targeted at complex FPGA's and SoC's. QuestaSim can be used by users who have experience with ModelSim as it shares most of the common debug features and capabilities. One of the main differences between QuestaSim and Modelsim (besides performance/capacity) is that QuestaSim is the simulation engine for the Questa Platform which includes integration of Verification Management, Formal based technologies, Questa Verification IP, Low Power Simulation and Accelerated Coverage Closure technologies. QuestaSim natively supports SystemVerilog for Testbench, UPF, UCIS, OVM/UVM where ModelSim does not.

FloEFD is a ‘design concurrent’ CFD tool for use in early-stage product design and is embedded within MCAD systems such as Solidworks, Creo Elements/Pro, CATIA V5 and Siemens NX


Thermal Characterization and Thermal Interface Material (TIM) Measurement equipment:

T3Ster is a hardware product that embodies an implementation of the JEDEC JESD51-1 standard for IC package thermal characterization and is compliant with JESD51-14 for Rth-JC measurement
TeraLED provides automation of the CIE 127:2007 standard providing total flux, chromaticity and correlated color temperature (CCT) for power LEDs. With T3Ster it provides thermal resistance metrics for LEDs based on the real dissipated heating power.
DynTIM extends T3Ster, providing a dynamic thermal test station for thermal conductivity measurements of thermal interface materials (TIMs), thermal greases and gap pads.


FloMASTER is a 1D or system-level CFD solution for analyzing fluid mechanics in complex pipe flow systems (from the acquisition of Flowmaster Ltd in 2012).
CADRA Design Drafting is a 2-1/2D mechanical drafting and documentation package specifically designed for drafting professionals. It provides the tools needed to develop complex drawings quickly and easily (from the acquisition of the CADRA product in 2013).



The Veloce product family enables SoC emulation and transaction-based acceleration.

History[edit]
In 1981, the idea of computer-aided design for electronics as the foundation of a company occurred to several groups - those who founded Mentor, Valid Logic Systems, and Daisy Systems. One of the main distinctions between these groups was that the founding engineers of Mentor, whose backgrounds were in software development at Tektronix, ruled out designing and manufacturing proprietary computers to run their software applications. They felt that hardware was going to become a commodity owned by big computer companies, so instead they would select an existing computer system as the hardware platform for the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) programs they would build.
By February 1981, most of the start-up team had been identified; by March, the three executive founders, Tom Bruggere, Gerry Langeler and Dave Moffenbeier had left Tektronix, and by May the business plan was complete. The first round of money, $1 million, came from Sutter Hill, Greylock, and Venrock Associates. The next round was $2 million from five venture capital firms, and in April 1983 a third round raised $7 million more. Mentor Graphics was one of the first companies to attract venture capital to Oregon.
Apollo Computer workstations were chosen as the initial hardware platform. Based in Chelmsford, Apollo was less than a year old and had only announced itself to the public a few weeks prior to when the founders of Mentor Graphics began their initial meetings.
When Mentor entered the CAE market the company had two technical differentiators: the first was the software - Mentor, Valid, and Daisy each had software with different strengths and weaknesses. The second, was the hardware - Mentor ran all programs on the Apollo workstation, while Daisy and Valid each built their own hardware. By the late 1980s, all EDA companies abandoned proprietary hardware in favor of workstations manufactured by companies such as Apollo and Sun Microsystems.
After a frenzied development, the IDEA 1000 product was introduced at the 1982 Design Automation Conference, though in a suite and not on the floor.[6]
As of 2012, Mentor's major competitors are: Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Altium, and Zuken.
In June 2008, Cadence Design Systems offered to acquire Mentor Graphics in a leveraged buyout. On 15 August 2008, Cadence withdrew this offer quoting an inability to raise the necessary capital and the unwillingness of Mentor Graphics' Board and management to discuss the offer.[7] Mentor acquired Flomerics Group plc for $60 million in cash in October 2008, and in August 2009, Mentor completed the acquisition of silicon manufacturing testing company LogicVision for $13 million in an all-stock deal.[8] Mentor completed the acquisition of Valor Computerized Systems in March 2010 in a cash and stock deal valued at $50 million.[9]
On 22 February 2011, Carl Icahn, an activist investor, made an offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.
On 14 November 2016, Mentor Graphics announced that it was to be acquired by Siemens for $4.5 billion, at $37.25 per share, a 21% premium on Mentor's closing price on the previous Friday.[10] The acquisition was completed in March 2017.[11]
Locations[edit]
Mentor Graphics product development takes place in the USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan, Pakistan, India and Egypt. James "Jim" Ready, left Mentor in 1999 to form the embedded Linux company MontaVista. Neil Henderson joined Mentor Graphics in 2002 with the acquisition of Accelerated Technology Inc. Stephen Mellor, a leader in the UML space and co-originator of the Shlaer-Mellor design methodology, joined Mentor Graphics in 2004 following the acquisition of Project Technology.
Management[edit]
Walden C. Rhines is the company's chairman[12] of the board and chief executive officer whereas Gregory K. Hinckley serves as the president[12] of the corporation.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
