You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
Important Fund Information

The Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest up to 100% of their assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.

Investments by the Funds in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk--that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest--and interest rate risk--that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of the debt securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will decline.

Global Total Return and Global Dynamic Income Funds may invest in derivative securities. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Funds will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Funds pay a premium whether or not an option is exercised.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals, managing $21.9 billion in client assets as of December 31, 2015 through a variety of investment products designed to suit their investment needs. Assets under management do not include assets under advisement of $609 million and $733 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, for which the Company provides model portfolio design and oversight.  Assets Under Management Our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management and with our ability to manage variable expenses. The following table details our assets under management, based on the four investment product types we offer in the funds and separate account categories, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 Funds Open-end funds $ 12,172 $ 14,790 $ 16,128 Closed-end funds 6,346 6,211 6,266 Total funds 18,518 21,001 22,394 Separate Accounts Institutional accounts 2,309 1,576 3,081 Managed accounts 1,081 929 1,068 Total separate accounts 3,390 2,505 4,149 Total assets under management $ 21,908 $ 23,506 $ 26,543  In order to increase our assets under management and expand our business, we must develop and market investment products and strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients - investors seeking superior, risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. The value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract and retain clients will depend on a variety of factors, including, among others:   the amount of distributed and reinvested capital gains and income;   fluctuations in the global financial markets and the valuations of securities that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets;   the use of leverage within the closed-end funds;   our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best-in-class service;   the relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices;   competitive conditions in the asset management and broader financial services sectors;   investor sentiment and confidence; and   our introduction of new investment strategies and products, and our decision to close and re-open strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients.  Investment Products  and market appreciation or depreciation. Our revenues from closed-end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage. In addition, in a typical underwritten public offering, investors are charged a commission by the selling firms. We do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed-end fund shares, although we may pay asset-based distribution and service fees, as well as one-time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed-end funds. Separate Accounts   Managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker-dealers.  Revenues   the amount of cash paid for capital gain and income distributions;   market appreciation or depreciation;   the use of leverage within our closed-end products;   relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products and strategies compared to benchmarks and competitors; level of net sales and redemptions, which represent the sum of new client assets, additional funding from existing clients, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, and sales and redemptions of open-end fund shares; a determination by the independent trustees of the funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds' investment management agreements with us; and   increased competition.  Investment management fees that we receive from funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis. Investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor and for which we provide model portfolio design and oversight are generally computed quarterly, either in advance or in arrears, based on the average assets under management or assets under management at the beginning or end of the quarterly period. We recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services. Distribution and Underwriting Fees  component of distribution and underwriting fees. Distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the following:   total composition of our assets under management by share class;   market appreciation or depreciation; and   the level of sales and redemptions.  Rule 12b-1 distribution and/or service fees are asset-based fees that the open-end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act. These fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets in specific share classes of the open-end funds. These fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets and the relative mix of assets among share classes. Rule 12b-1 fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period, as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions previously paid by us to third parties.   variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, incentive compensation, changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors; changes in distribution expense as a result of fluctuations in open-end fund sales and level of redemptions; market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management which will directly impact distribution expenses; the amount of Rule 12b-1 distribution and/or service fees that we receive, as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future, which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees; changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to further penetrate and support new and existing distribution channels and clients; and expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, professional services, depreciation, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure.  Employee Compensation and Benefits  value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. Fair value is determined on the date granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units. Distribution Expenses  (in thousands) 2015 2014 2013 Distribution and underwriting fees $ 41,583 $ 49,764 $ 54,068 Distribution expenses (40,845 ) (48,432 ) (53,082 ) Net distribution fees $ 738 $ 1,332 $ 986 Net distribution fee margin 2 % 3 % 2 %  The net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of sales and assets by share class affects the overall net distribution fee margin. The change in the net distribution fee margin is primarily due to the rate of the decline in revenue in all share classes and contingent deferred sales charge revenues, compared with the decline in distribution expenses and amortization of deferred sales commissions.  Non-operating Income  Income is allocated to non-controlling interests based on the average ownership interest during the period in which the income is earned. As a result, our income before income tax provision, excluding Calamos Interests' non-controlling interest, includes 22.2% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, of Calamos Investments' net income. Income before income tax provision includes income on cash and cash equivalents and investment securities held solely by CAM during the same period. This investment income is not reduced by non-controlling interest; therefore, the resulting non-controlling interest as presented in the statement of operations differs slightly than their corresponding ownership percentage.  Operating Results Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014 Assets Under Management Assets under management decreased by $1.6 billion, or 7%, to $21.9 billion at December 31, 2015 from $23.5 billion at December 31, 2014. Average assets under management decreased by $1.6 billion, or 6%, to $23.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $25.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, assets under management consisted of 85% funds, and 15% separate accounts. As of December 31, 2014, assets under management consisted of 89% funds and 11% separate accounts.

(NASDAQ:    CLMS) ("CAM") announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle to be acquired by an entity (the "Acquirer") formed by Mr. John Calamos and Mr. John Koudounis. Mr. Calamos is the founder of Calamos Investments LLC, the operating company of CAM, and CAM's Chairman.  Mr.  Koudounis is the Chief Executive Officer of CAM.  Pursuant to the agreement in principle, the Acquirer will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock of CAM not owned by the Acquirer for $8.25 per share in cash.  Promptly after the closing of the tender offer, any shares not tendered in the tender offer (other than shares owned by Acquirer, and shares for which appraisal is properly sought under applicable law) will be acquired in a second-step merger at the same cash price as paid in the tender offer.  The agreement in principle is subject to the final negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, but is not contingent on the Acquirer obtaining financing.








CAM's Board of Directors formed an independent Special Committee after Mr. Calamos and Mr. Koudounis expressed an interest in a possible transaction in October. The Special Committee reviewed the acquisition proposal, and considered various options available to CAM, including remaining a public company.  The Special Committee concluded unanimously that the proposed transaction, subject to negotiation of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, would be fair and in the best interests of the Company's public shareholders, and has approved the agreement in principle.
Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Mr. Calamos said:   "As investors at Calamos, we have always taken the long view.  I believe a fully private ownership structure will enable John Koudounis to focus on managing our business to his vision for our firm's long-term growth."
Mr. Koudounis added:  "Upon arriving at Calamos, I directed an extensive analysis of our corporate structure. Being a fully private company—consistent with 95% of asset managers today—will allow us to manage the business with the same long-term view that we apply to our investment approach. By eliminating the distraction of the market's increased focus on short-term metrics, we can be singularly dedicated to improving our key performance areas."
As of September 30, 2016, CAM owned 22.2% of Calamos Investments, with the remaining 77.8% being privately owned by Calamos Partners LLC. Mr. Calamos, other Calamos family members and Mr. Koudounis, directly and indirectly own 100% of Calamos Partners.  Calamos Partners also owns all of CAM's outstanding Class B common stock, which represents 97.4% of the combined voting power of all classes of CAM's voting stock. 
Forward Looking Statements
Any statements made in this communication that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about the expected timetable for completing the transaction and the potential effects of the acquisition, are forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, certain assumptions and current expectations and should be evaluated as such. These statements may be identified by their use of forward-looking terminology such as the words "expects," "projects," "anticipates," "intends" and other similar words. Forward-looking statements include statements that may relate to CAM's or the Acquirer's plans, objectives, strategies, goals, future events, future revenues or performance, and other information that is not historical information. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the ability of the parties to finally negotiate and execute a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement; the satisfaction of the conditions to the tender offer and the merger that will be contained in the definitive merger agreement; the absence of certain material adverse changes in the business of CAM; and general economic, business and market conditions.  For a more complete discussion of certain of the risks and uncertainties with respect to the business of CAM, see the discussion of risks and uncertainties in CAM's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, other reports CAM files under the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as well as the tender offer documents to be filed by the Acquirer and by CAM. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date that the press release is issued, and CAM undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements in this document are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
Important Additional Information and Where to Find It
Following the final negotiation and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive merger agreement, it is anticipated that the Acquirer will commence a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of CAM. The tender offer has not yet commenced, and is subject to the final negotiation and execution of the definitive merger agreement. This communication is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of CAM, nor is it a substitute for the tender offer materials that the Acquirer will file with the SEC upon commencement of the tender offer. At the time that the tender offer is commenced, the Acquirer will file tender offer materials on Schedule TO with the SEC, and CAM will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with respect to the offer. THE TENDER OFFER MATERIALS (INCLUDING AN OFFER TO PURCHASE, A RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TENDER OFFER DOCUMENTS) AND THE SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY AND CONSIDERED BY CAM'S STOCKHOLDERS BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE TENDER OFFER. Both the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement will be made available to CAM's stockholders free of charge. A free copy of the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement will also be made available to all stockholders of CAM by contacting CAM at IR@calamos.com or by phone at +1.630.245.7200, or by visiting CAM's website (www.calamos.com). In addition, the tender offer statement and the solicitation/recommendation statement (and all other documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC's website (www.sec.gov) upon filing with the SEC. CAM'S STOCKHOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE TENDER OFFER STATEMENT AND THE SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT, IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, AS EACH MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BEFORE THEY MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE TENDER OFFER, IF IT IS COMMENCED, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND THE PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION.

	Third Quarter 2016 Results and Declares Dividend



	NAPERVILLE, Ill., October 27, 2016  Calamos Asset Management, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMS), representing the public shares outstanding, owns 22.2% of the
	operating company, Calamos Investments LLC, with the remaining 77.8% privately owned by Calamos Partners LLC (formerly owned by Calamos Family Partners, Inc.). Calamos Asset Management, Inc. (CAM) and Calamos Investments LLC together operate a
	diversified global investment firm offering U.S. growth equity, global equity, convertible, multi-asset and alternative strategies, and today reported consolidated results for third quarter 2016 and comparative periods.



	Highlights



	GAAP diluted earnings per
	share was $0.07 for the third quarter of 2016 compared with $0.01 in the previous quarter and $0.02 in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the second quarter was the
	result of higher non-operating income from our investment portfolio offset by $4.9 million of debt extinguishment costs in the third quarter. Net income attributable to CAM was $1.2 million for the quarter compared with $224,000 last quarter and
	$363,000 in the third quarter of 2015.


	Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14 for the third quarter compared with $0.14 in the
	previous quarter and $0.18 in the third quarter of 2015.

	1

	Non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM was $2.5 million for the quarter compared with $2.3 million last quarter and $3.3 million in the
	third quarter of 2015.


	Assets Under Management

	2

	were $20.1 billion at
	September 30, 2016 compared with $20.1 billion at the end of last quarter and $22.5 billion at September 30, 2015. Net outflows were $746 million for the quarter compared with net outflows of $1.0 billion in the previous quarter and $436
	million in the third quarter of 2015.

	See Table A and Table A  Notes for a more detailed description of non-GAAP financial measures, how they may be useful to management and investors in evaluating the company, how they may differ from non-GAAP
	financial measures disclosed by other companies, and a reconciliation of such adjusted measures to the most related GAAP financial measures.







	2

	 


	Assets Under Management do not include $460 million, $478 million, and $612 million as of September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively, of assets under advisement for which
	the company provides model portfolio design and oversight.




	 






	Total revenues for the current quarter were $48.3 million compared with $48.3 million in the
	previous quarter and $57.6 million in the third quarter a year ago. Operating margin was 8.5% for the third quarter, 5.2% in the previous quarter and 15.0% in the third quarter of 2015.


	The Board of Directors of CAM declared a regular quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share payable on November 21, 2016 to shareholders of
	record on November 8, 2016.

	Financial Discussion  Third Quarter 2016 compared with Third Quarter 2015




	Operating Income



	Third quarter 2016
	revenues of $48.3 million decreased $9.3 million from third quarter 2015 primarily due to a decrease in Average Assets Under Management. Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $44.2 million compared with $49.0 million in the third
	quarter of 2015 primarily due to lower distribution expenses, general and administrative expenses, and marketing and sales promotion expenses. Operating margin was 8.5% for the third quarter, down from 15.0% in the third quarter of 2015.



	Non-Operating Income



	GAAP non-operating
	income was $25.1 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared with a loss of $11.7 million for the third quarter of 2015, as presented in Table B. Non-GAAP non-operating income, net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and
	partnerships

	3

	was $4.4 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared with non-GAAP non-operating loss, net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnerships of $7.4
	million for the third quarter of 2015.



	Financial Position



	As of September 30, 2016, the corporate investment portfolio was $320.7 million, which included cash, cash equivalents, and investments
	that were principally comprised of investments in products that the company manages. The corporate investment portfolio is used to provide seed capital for new products, to maintain conservative levels of capital for the companys regulated
	subsidiaries and to invest in other corporate strategic initiatives.


	At the end of the third quarter, the company had no long-term debt
	and total equity was $352.3 million. In July, the company repaid its $46.0 million of long-term debt and incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $4.9 million using cash on-hand.



	Market Capitalization



	As of
	September 30, 2016, CAM, representing the public shares outstanding, owns 22.2% of the operating company, Calamos Investments LLC, with the remaining 77.8% privately owned by Calamos Partners LLC. Because of our ownership structure, reported
	market capitalization does not reflect the entire value of the operating company, but rather only CAMs 22.2% interest, which is publicly traded.



	Investor Conference Call



	Management will
	hold an investor conference call at 3:30 p.m. Central Time on Thursday, October 27, 2016. To access the live call and view managements presentation, visit the Investor Relations section of the companys website at

	www.calamos.com/investors

	Investor Relations section of the companys website at

	www.calamos.com/investors

	for at least 90 days following the date of the call.


	 


	 





	3

	 


	Management believes non-GAAP non-operating income/(loss), net of redeemable non-controlling interest in consolidated funds and partnership investments provides comparability of this information among reporting periods
	and is an effective measure for reviewing the companys non-operating contribution to its results.

	forward-looking statements. For a discussion concerning some of these and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could affect future results, see Forward-Looking Information in Managements Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and, where applicable, Risk Factors in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.




	Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the

	Table A  Notes




	Calamos Asset Management, Inc.




	Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP



	The company provides investors with certain adjusted, non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM and
	non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust GAAP financial measures to include the tax
	benefit from the amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets and CAMs non-operating income, net of taxes. The company believes these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of operating financial
	performance, as well as to facilitate comparisons with historical earnings results. These adjustments to the companys GAAP results are made with the intent of providing investors a more complete understanding of the companys
	underlying earnings results and trends and marketplace performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis of managing our business.


	The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable
	financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in Table A.


	Non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM is calculated by adjusting the following items from GAAP net income attributable to CAM:


	 




	 


	(i)


	amortization of deferred taxes on intangible assets associated with the election under section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Section 754 election); and




	 




	 


	(ii)


	non-operating income, net of taxes.




	Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated by
	dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.


	The deferred tax assets from the
	Section 754 election allows for a quarterly reduction of approximately $2.0 million in current and future income taxes owed by the company, to the extent a payable exists. To the extent that the deferred tax asset exceeds net income, a federal
	net operating loss carryforward is created. This cash savings and any resulting net operating loss carryforward accrue solely for the benefit of the shareholders of the companys common stock. The company believes that adjusting this item from
	the calculation of the above non-GAAP items can be a useful measure in allowing investors to see the companys performance. Non-operating income is excluded from the above non-GAAP items as it can distort comparisons between periods. As noted
	above, the company believes that measures excluding these items are useful in analyzing operating trends and allowing for more comparability between periods, which may be useful to investors.


	The company believes that non-GAAP net income attributable to CAM and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are useful measures of performance
	and may be useful to investors, because they provide measures of the companys core business activities adjusting for items that are non-cash and costs that may distort comparisons between periods. These measures are provided in addition to the
	companys net income attributable to CAM and diluted earnings per share calculated under GAAP, but are not substitutes for those calculations.

THEREFORE ,

and the Chairman of the Board of the Company (the “
Chairman ”), gives written notice to Executive or
Executive gives written notice to the Company and the Chairman, in
accordance with   Section 18(c) , below at least

reasonable duties and responsibilities as the Board and/or the
Chairman may from time to time assign to Executive consistent with

including its

and affiliates, in each case without additional
compensation.

Positions . On or after the delivery of a Notice of Termination
by the Company or the Executive pursuant to Section 5(g) or

in writing, from the Board and any or all offices, directorships
and fiduciary positions of the Company and its affiliates in which
Executive is serving, as the Company may request.

(e) No Conflict with
Prior Agreements . The Executive represents and warrants to the
Company that the Executive’s execution of this Agreement, the

represents and warrants that the Executive will not possess or
bring to the premises of the Company confidential or proprietary

plans and programs of the Company, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, as in effect from time to time.

written notice, voluntarily terminate his employment without
liability.

(e) Termination by
the Company without Cause . The Company may terminate this
Agreement and Executive’s employment hereunder at any time
without Cause.

(f) Expiration of
Agreement . Upon expiration of the Term, Executive’s
employment shall automatically terminate. For purposes of
Section 6 , such termination shall be treated as a
termination by the Company without Cause if such expiration is by
reason of the Company having provided Executive with a notice of
non-renewal pursuant to   Section 1 , and shall be
treated as a termination by Executive without Good Reason if such
expiration is by reason of Executive having provided the Company
with a notice of non-renewal pursuant to

detail the circumstances claimed to provide a basis for the

indicated; and (iii) specifies the Date of Termination
(defined below); provided, such Notice of Termination may be
conditional if coupled with a notice of the Board’s
consideration of “Cause” or Executive’s intention
to resign for “Good Reason,” as the case may be, as
provided above. The failure by Executive or the Company to set
forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which
contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not
constitute a waiver of any right of Executive or the Company,
respectively, hereunder or preclude Executive or the Company,
respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing
Executive’s or the Company’s rights
hereunder.

(h) Date of
Termination . “ Date of Termination ” means
the date Notice of Termination is given pursuant to

Executive due to Disability pursuant to Section 5(a)

given, (ii) any Notice of Termination by the Company for Cause
pursuant to Section 5(b) shall be effective as of the

of absence, or accelerate the Executive’s Date of Termination

the Company for any purpose or create a condition constituting Good
Reason. In the event of Executive’s death during the Term,
the Date of Termination shall be the date of his death. In the
event of expiration of the Term, the Date of Termination shall be
the day following the last day of the Term.
6. Obligations of the Company

upon termination of employment are set forth below. Except to the
extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, the disposition of
Executive’s awards under the Long Term Incentive Program upon

and/or agreement applicable to such awards. For purposes of this
Section 6 , the term “ Accrued Obligations
” shall mean, as of the Date of Termination,

of any bonus, incentive compensation, deferred compensation and
other cash compensation earned and vested as of the Date of
Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (iii) any
benefits payable under the terms and conditions of the retirement
and welfare benefit plans described in Section 3(d)
above, and (iv) any accrued vacation pay, expense
reimbursements and other cash entitlements to which Executive is
entitled as of the Date of Termination to the extent not

(a) Death . If
Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of
Executive’s death, then this Agreement shall terminate

applicable Company plan or program which takes effect at the date

Accrued Obligations not theretofore paid, paid within thirty (30)

prior to the Date of Termination, and the denominator of which is

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
