 Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALGN) today announced the promotion of Christopher C. Puco to vice president, North American Sales, reporting to Align President and CEO Thomas M. Prescott. Mr. Puco assumes the role recently vacated by Dan Ellis, who has left the Company.




"Chris has been a highly effective and valuable member of the management team at Align for several years, and we are pleased to have him take on this new role and level of responsibility," said Mr. Prescott. "During his tenure, Chris has helped drive tremendous change and growth in our company and demonstrated leadership and expertise in both the Invisalign and iTero scanner businesses. We are looking forward to seeing him apply that experience and enthusiasm across the entire North American sales organization."



Mr. Puco joined Align in 2006 as a sales director and in 2008 became senior director for the Eastern sales area, which doubled its revenue under his leadership.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998.The Invisalign product family includes Invisalign, Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express10, Invisalign Express 5, Invisalign 
Lite, and Vivera Retainers.
