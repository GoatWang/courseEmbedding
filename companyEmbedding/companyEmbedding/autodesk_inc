Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work[4] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.
The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD, the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower[5] to Tesla electric cars.[6]
Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook, Homestyler, and Pixlr. The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community, and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through TechSoup Global. Autodesk's digital prototyping software, including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite, are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[7] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[8]
Autodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[9] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.

Platforms[edit]




A screenshot of AutoCAD, Autodesk's flagship product.


Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD 360. Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[10] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and “foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software”.[11] The products from the group include 123D, Fluid FX, Homestyler, Pixlr, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[12]
Architecture, engineering and construction[edit]
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building[13] designed and built using Autodesk software.[14] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP[15] (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[16] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[17] the Shanghai Tower, and New York’s Freedom Tower.[18]
Manufacturing[edit]
Autodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include Fusion 360, the Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Inventor Suite, Autodesk Inventor Professional Suite, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Vault, Alias Products, Simulation Mechanical, CFD, and Moldflow.
Media and entertainment[edit]
Autodesk Media and Entertainment products are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesk’s Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid.[19] The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are the Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suites, which include Maya, Softimage, 3ds Max, Mudbox, Smoke, Flame, and Lustre.
Much of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[20] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic, and other films.[21]
In 2011, Autodesk acquired a cloud-based set of image tools and utilities called Pixlr.[22]
Renderers[edit]
Autodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products are bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA MentalRay or Iray.

Autodesk Raytracer (ART; aka RapidRT[23]) - a simple pathtracing renderer which is based on Opticore technology.[24][25]

Autodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a raytracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio[26] and Autodesk Real-Time Ray Tracing Cluster


Autodesk A360 Rendering - a simple cloud renderer
Lagoa MultiOptics Renderer - a cloud renderer for visualization
Autodesk VRED - a OpenGL/offline renderer which supports direct NURBS raytracing

RenderGin (formerly Augenblick MMV) - a discontinued realtime NURBS raytracing renderer; the technology was merged into VRED.[27]


Autodesk Realtime Renderer (formerly VSR Realtime Renderer) - a discontinued raytracing renderer for Rhinoceros 3D.
Arnold Renderer - a CPU-only mono-directional pathtracing renderer for animation and visual effects
3ds Max Cloud Rendering - a technology preview cloud rendering system for Arnold on 3ds Max.[28][29]
Azure Batch Rendering - a cloud rendering system for Maya, 3ds Max and Arnold, which is provided by Autodesk and Microsoft.[30]
Turtle - a primary texture-baking renderer in Maya LT
Beast - a lighting middleware with lightmap-baking renderer
Maya Software - a scanline/raytracing hybrid renderer in Maya
3ds Max Scanline - a scanline/raytracing/radiosity hybrid renderer in 3ds Max

Lightscape - a discontinued radiosity renderer; its technologies were merged within Autodesk VIZ (later 3ds Max Design).[31]


Maya Vector - a vector renderer based on Electric Rain's RAViX technology.[32]
Maya Hardware 1.0 - a legacy GPU renderer in Maya
One Graphics System - a GPU photorealistic/non-photorealistic renderer, aka Nitrous/Quicksilver[33] in 3ds Max and Viewport 2.0/Hardware 2.0 in Maya

Discontinued products[edit]
Some of Autodesk's "retired" products are listed here:

Lightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.
Volo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.
Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.
Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in "realtime". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.

History[edit]
Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a computer-aided design application designed to run on the systems known as "microcomputers" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies.
Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[63] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.
Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.
AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[64] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.
In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.
In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay "used" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee.[65] A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[66] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a "sale with restrictions on use"[67] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[68] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[69]
Autodesk introduced its current logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California on February 26, 2013.[70][71][72]

Sustainability[edit]
Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[117][118] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company’s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk’s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company’s global GDP contribution.[119] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.
In 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[120] which focused on going green in building designs around the world where viewers learn about the leaders and technologies driving sustainable design.

Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work[4] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.
The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD, the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower[5] to Tesla electric cars.[6]
Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook, Homestyler, and Pixlr. The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community, and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through TechSoup Global. Autodesk's digital prototyping software, including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite, are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[7] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[8]
Autodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[9] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.

In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[10] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and “foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software”.[11] The products from the group include 123D, Fluid FX, Homestyler, Pixlr, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[12]
Architecture, engineering and construction[edit]
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building[13] designed and built using Autodesk software.[14] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP[15] (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[16] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[17] the Shanghai Tower, and New York’s Freedom Tower.[18]
Manufacturing[edit]
Autodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include Fusion 360, the Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Inventor Suite, Autodesk Inventor Professional Suite, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Vault, Alias Products, Simulation Mechanical, CFD, and Moldflow.
Media and entertainment[edit]
Autodesk Media and Entertainment products are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesk’s Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid.[19] The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are the Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suites, which include Maya, Softimage, 3ds Max, Mudbox, Smoke, Flame, and Lustre.
Much of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[20] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic, and other films.[21]
In 2011, Autodesk acquired a cloud-based set of image tools and utilities called Pixlr.[22]
Renderers[edit]
Autodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products are bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA MentalRay or Iray.

Autodesk Raytracer (ART; aka RapidRT[23]) - a simple pathtracing renderer which is based on Opticore technology.[24][25]

Autodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a raytracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio[26] and Autodesk Real-Time Ray Tracing Cluster

Discontinued products[edit]
Some of Autodesk's "retired" products are listed here:

Lightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.
Volo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.
Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.
Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in "realtime". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.

History[edit]
Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a computer-aided design application designed to run on the systems known as "microcomputers" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies.
Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[63] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.
Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.
AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[64] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.
In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.
In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay "used" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee.[65] A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[66] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a "sale with restrictions on use"[67] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[68] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[69]
Autodesk introduced its current logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California on February 26, 2013.[70][71][72]

Sustainability[edit]
Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[117][118] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company’s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk’s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company’s global GDP contribution.[119] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.
In 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[120] which focused on going green in building designs around the world where viewers learn about the leaders and technologies driving sustainable design.

Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work[4] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.
The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD, the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower[5] to Tesla electric cars.[6]
Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook, Homestyler, and Pixlr. The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community, and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through TechSoup Global. Autodesk's digital prototyping software, including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite, are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[7] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[8]
Autodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[9] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.

Products[edit]
Platforms[edit]




A screenshot of AutoCAD, Autodesk's flagship product.


Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD 360. Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[10] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and “foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software”.[11] The products from the group include 123D, Fluid FX, Homestyler, Pixlr, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[12]
Architecture, engineering and construction[edit]
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building[13] designed and built using Autodesk software.[14] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP[15] (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[16] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[17] the Shanghai Tower, and New York’s Freedom Tower.[18]
Manufacturing[edit]
Autodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include Fusion 360, the Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Inventor Suite, Autodesk Inventor Professional Suite, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Vault, Alias Products, Simulation Mechanical, CFD, and Moldflow.
Media and entertainment[edit]
Autodesk Media and Entertainment products are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesk’s Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid.[19] The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are the Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suites, which include Maya, Softimage, 3ds Max, Mudbox, Smoke, Flame, and Lustre.
Much of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[20] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic, and other films.[21]
In 2011, Autodesk acquired a cloud-based set of image tools and utilities called Pixlr.[22]
Renderers[edit]
Autodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products are bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA MentalRay or Iray.

Autodesk Raytracer (ART; aka RapidRT[23]) - a simple pathtracing renderer which is based on Opticore technology.[24][25]

Autodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a raytracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio[26] and Autodesk Real-Time Ray Tracing Cluster


Autodesk A360 Rendering - a simple cloud renderer
Lagoa MultiOptics Renderer - a cloud renderer for visualization
Autodesk VRED - a OpenGL/offline renderer which supports direct NURBS raytracing

RenderGin (formerly Augenblick MMV) - a discontinued realtime NURBS raytracing renderer; the technology was merged into VRED.[27]


Autodesk Realtime Renderer (formerly VSR Realtime Renderer) - a discontinued raytracing renderer for Rhinoceros 3D.
Arnold Renderer - a CPU-only mono-directional pathtracing renderer for animation and visual effects
3ds Max Cloud Rendering - a technology preview cloud rendering system for Arnold on 3ds Max.[28][29]
Azure Batch Rendering - a cloud rendering system for Maya, 3ds Max and Arnold, which is provided by Autodesk and Microsoft.[30]
Turtle - a primary texture-baking renderer in Maya LT
Beast - a lighting middleware with lightmap-baking renderer
Maya Software - a scanline/raytracing hybrid renderer in Maya
3ds Max Scanline - a scanline/raytracing/radiosity hybrid renderer in 3ds Max

Lightscape - a discontinued radiosity renderer; its technologies were merged within Autodesk VIZ (later 3ds Max Design).[31]


Maya Vector - a vector renderer based on Electric Rain's RAViX technology.[32]
Maya Hardware 1.0 - a legacy GPU renderer in Maya
One Graphics System - a GPU photorealistic/non-photorealistic renderer, aka Nitrous/Quicksilver[33] in 3ds Max and Viewport 2.0/Hardware 2.0 in Maya

Discontinued products[edit]
Some of Autodesk's "retired" products are listed here:

Lightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.
Volo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.
Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.
Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in "realtime". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.

History[edit]
Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a computer-aided design application designed to run on the systems known as "microcomputers" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies.
Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[63] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.
Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.
AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[64] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.
In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.
In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay "used" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee.[65] A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[66] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a "sale with restrictions on use"[67] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[68] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[69]

Sustainability[edit]
Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[117][118] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company’s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk’s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company’s global GDP contribution.[119] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.
In 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[120] which focused on going green in building designs around the world where viewers learn about the leaders and technologies driving sustainable design.

Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California, and features a gallery of its customers' work[4] in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.
The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD, the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower[5] to Tesla electric cars.[6]
Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook, Homestyler, and Pixlr. The company makes educational versions of its software available at no cost to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community, and also as a donation to eligible nonprofits through TechSoup Global. Autodesk's digital prototyping software, including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite, are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[7] The company's Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.[8]
Autodesk's Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[9] 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.

Products[edit]
Platforms[edit]




A screenshot of AutoCAD, Autodesk's flagship product.


Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD 360. Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[10] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and “foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software”.[11] The products from the group include 123D, Fluid FX, Homestyler, Pixlr, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[12]
Architecture, engineering and construction[edit]
The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building[13] designed and built using Autodesk software.[14] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP[15] (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[16] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[17] the Shanghai Tower, and New York’s Freedom Tower.[18]
Manufacturing[edit]
Autodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include Fusion 360, the Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Inventor Suite, Autodesk Inventor Professional Suite, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Vault, Alias Products, Simulation Mechanical, CFD, and Moldflow.
Media and entertainment[edit]
Autodesk Media and Entertainment products are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesk’s Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid.[19] The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are the Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suites, which include Maya, Softimage, 3ds Max, Mudbox, Smoke, Flame, and Lustre.
Much of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[20] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic, and other films.[21]
In 2011, Autodesk acquired a cloud-based set of image tools and utilities called Pixlr.[22]
Renderers[edit]
Autodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products are bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA MentalRay or Iray.

Autodesk Raytracer (ART; aka RapidRT[23]) - a simple pathtracing renderer which is based on Opticore technology.[24][25]

Autodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a raytracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio[26] and Autodesk Real-Time Ray Tracing Cluster


Autodesk A360 Rendering - a simple cloud renderer
Lagoa MultiOptics Renderer - a cloud renderer for visualization
Autodesk VRED - a OpenGL/offline renderer which supports direct NURBS raytracing

RenderGin (formerly Augenblick MMV) - a discontinued realtime NURBS raytracing renderer; the technology was merged into VRED.[27]


Autodesk Realtime Renderer (formerly VSR Realtime Renderer) - a discontinued raytracing renderer for Rhinoceros 3D.
Arnold Renderer - a CPU-only mono-directional pathtracing renderer for animation and visual effects
3ds Max Cloud Rendering - a technology preview cloud rendering system for Arnold on 3ds Max.[28][29]
Azure Batch Rendering - a cloud rendering system for Maya, 3ds Max and Arnold, which is provided by Autodesk and Microsoft.[30]

Maya Hardware 1.0 - a legacy GPU renderer in Maya
One Graphics System - a GPU photorealistic/non-photorealistic renderer, aka Nitrous/Quicksilver[33] in 3ds Max and Viewport 2.0/Hardware 2.0 in Maya

Discontinued products[edit]
Some of Autodesk's "retired" products are listed here:

Lightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, while existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped.
Volo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.
Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.
Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in "realtime". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles.

History[edit]
Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a computer-aided design application designed to run on the systems known as "microcomputers" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies.
Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP.[63] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.
Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS & Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.
AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[64] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.
In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.
In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay "used" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee.[65] A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[66] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a "sale with restrictions on use"[67] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[68] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[69]
Autodesk introduced its current logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California on February 26, 2013.[70][71][72]

Sustainability[edit]
Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[117][118] Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company’s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk’s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company’s global GDP contribution.[119] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.
In 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e² Design,[120] which focused on going green in building designs around the world where viewers learn about the leaders and technologies driving sustainable design.

Autodesk To Soar On Subscriptions - Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Autodesk To Soar On SubscriptionsMar.20.17 | About: Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK) Yingjing Lu Long/short equity, long only, value, GrowthSummaryAutodesk's decision to move to subscription model of its major product line will generate more consistent revenue.Autodesk's is showing more promising sales performance in emerging market; Its new subscription model will also guarantee more profit by reducing chance of licence pirating.Autodesk's existing product line will help it win the competition in emerging area such as VR and Photogrammatry.By Yingjing Lu, Xinhui Guo, Zichen Liu, and Xingjian Yu Company Overview Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a company that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment industries. In 2016, Autodesk had over 9000 employees and generated $2.512 billion revenue with $228.8 net income. Autodesk has three collections of software products: architecture, engineering and construction; product design; media and entertainment. Each collection has multiple software products. Architecture, engineering and construction collection includes products such as Revit, AutoCAD, InfraWorks 360. Product design collection includes Inventor Professional and others. Media and entertainment collection includes, for example, Maya and 3ds Max. Autodesk's products are widely used in industries. Major industry-leading companies such as Airbus, Disney, deploy Autodesk's products in their business. In February 2015, Autodesk announced the transition from perpetual licensing to pay-as-you-go subscription plans. Under perpetual licensing, users pay one-time upfront fee to purchase legal license to the software. Under subscription plans, users pay for licensing of monthly, quarterly, annual, or multi-year term lengths, depending on users' needs. Subscription plans allow users to have the most up-to-date software without paying extra for updates. Under the subscription plan, users can also take advantage of the Autodesk cloud service that allows them to access software and files from any device they choose to use. In addition to providing payment and location flexibility, subscription plans prevent unlicensed usage of software better than perpetual licensing. The consequential financial benefits of this change of licensing model will be discussed further in later sections.
 Autodesk has huge growth potentials. Virtual reality has been a growing trend in technology, and Autodesk, having its visual, 3-dimensional design software, will be able to capture large percentage of the market share. We shall also consider the potential sales growth in industrial software. There has been rapid growth in property construction and public infrastructure in developing countries, such as China and India. Autodesk's construction and engineering software will be widely used in those countries to design buildings and transportation systems. The long-term construction growth in developing countries is great opportunity for Autodesk to generate sales revenue for the next decades. The key of Autodesk's success is whether Autodesk will be able to capture the profits from sales of software products in the developing countries. Licensing laws in such countries are incomplete and loosely executed. Many companies may use unlicensed software, which do not generate revenue for Autodesk. However, as we mentioned before, the new subscription plan model can largely prevent unlicensed usage of software. We believe Autodesk's software will be widely used in developing regions and generated increased sales revenue. The risk of Autodesk's future is whether it will be able to maintain its lead in the quickly-changing and highly competitive software industry. Although Autodesk currently has significant advantage, the fast pace of new software development and merger/acquisitions among existing companies and products can change the competitive landscape in a few years. Many leaders in the software industries have lost their advantages in a short period of time. However, we see Autodesk's strong initiative and commitment to stay ahead in the competition, to maintain its advantages and to advance further. With its current physical and intellectual assets, and its commitment to continuing research and development, we think Autodesk will advance faster than its competitors and widen the lead.
 Financial Analysis Income Statement from Yahoo Finance Gross profit had a 24.3% drop (from $648M to $512M) at the first quarter of 2016.

Compared to its competitors, AutoCAD is more affordable, easy to learn and competently functional. According to Forbes, Autodesk has achieved more than 85% market share in major areas in Europe and America with its CAD product line in 2015. The stable market share has made AutoCAD series an universal industrial standard which greatly improves user fidelity. Architecture, Engineering and Construction Product Line: AutoCAD AutoCAD LT Autodesk Inventor Autodesk Revit Autodesk Vault Autodesk Fusion 360 Competitors: ANSYS. ANSYS is a company that provides solutions for CAD and simulation for construction and manufacturing. However, ANSYS puts more emphasis on its simulation algorithm instead of its CAD part. On the other hand, Autodesk puts more emphasis on the ease of use of CAD drawing process. As a result, many professional users usually use AutoCAD to brainstorm and to draw the models and them import their model into ANSYS to run simulation. In this most commonly used scenario, ANSYS's and Autodesk's product line are identified as complements than direct competing substitutes. Bentley & AVEVA Systems. The above two companies are both identified as competitors in the manufacturing CAD area with Autodesk. Compared with Autodesk, those two companies are focus more on the users in highly sophisticated industries such as aero plane design, ship design and energy plant design. As a result, they usually deliver more integrated solutions from design software to simulation to visualization. For example, AVEVA's solution for chemical engineer industries delivers CAD software for the design of the plant, thermodynamic simulation of plant, stress test and visualization of plant operation. The holistic solution that those companies deliver make the two competitors occupies a lot of market shares in those industries where they are targeting at. But at the same time, because their solutions are really focused, the pricing of their product is unaffordable for middle scale and small scale design companies. Even in large industrial design institutions, AutoCAD is still the competent one to accomplish regular design work. As a result, Autodesk's product line is more competitive in occupying the mainstream industries and market share.
 Media and Entertainment Product Line: Autodesk Maya Autodesk 3ds Max Autodesk Motion Builder Autodesk Mudbox In the media and entertain 3D software market, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max are unquestionably dominating products in those market. Both of those software delivers fast and easy workflow for animators and modelers. Through third party collaborators such asV-Ray, I-Ray and lighthouse, Autodesk's software can deliver more realistic simulation and more efficient rendering flow (which is one of the most important part for animation industries to optimize their workflow). Also, most peripheral products such as game engines and motion tracking software all natively support models created from Maya and 3ds Max. Furthermore, Autodesk works closely with hardware developers such as NVIDIA and AMD to make sure their newest hardware acceleration features such as AMD OpenCL and NVIDIA CUDA can optimize Autodesk products. All of those aspects make Autodesk M&E software the fastest, most widely used, and most compatible software in the mainstream market. Competitors: Cinema 4D is considered as a substitute product for Autodesk Maya, but not as powerful as Maya. Both of these products provides modeling, animating and rendering features. However, Cinema 4D is not optimized for hardware acceleration. As a result, Cinema 4D right now is only limited in small scale animation production. Furthermore, Cinema 4D does not have a great community of developers to provide motion tracking support and real time rendering such as I-Ray. Another example is Zbrush which can be a great complement for Autodesk 3ds Max in the rapid modeling field. Zbrush provide more intuitive brushing interface that allows creators to sculpt models in a faster way. However, 3Ds Max is stronger in rendering textures. As a result, modelers usually use Zbrush to create models and put them into 3Ds Max for rendering. As a result, the two competing software can work as complement to each other's weakness and thus make their competition in the market less intrusive.
 Emerging Area (AR; VR; 3D Printing; Photogrammetry) Product Line: Autodesk Maya Autodesk 3ds Max Autodesk Remake Autodesk Recap Autodesk 123D Catch Autodesk, compared with other startup companies, have more competitive advantage in the emerging areas such as VR AR, 3D printing, and photogrammetry. For VR and AR development, Autodesk's Maya and 3Ds Max are already the industrial standard for development. Most of the VR and AR engines such as Unity3D, Vuforia, and Cry Engine have innate support to Autodesk's interface. In terms of 3D printing and Photogrammetry, Autodesk's dominating CAD product line and its rapidly developing new products 123D Catch, Remake and Recap are competitively powerful tools for current workflow in those areas. Even though there are more new companies such as 3D Systems, Rhino, and 3D Flow provide more affordable options, we still think that Autodesk, with its already well-rounded design product ecosystem and its industry standard that results in its dominating market share, will be the flagship in the emerging market as well. Investment Theme: The major investment theme of going long for Autodesk is that we regard Autodesk as the leading CAD software company and as its business model changed from licensing to subscription, it will face a short term drawback, which is the situation right now, but will gain more sustainable growth in the future. Advantages of Subscription Model:  More consistent cash flow: The returning users will offer Autodesk consistent revenue every month after they complete their subscription payment. The more stable cash flow will offer Autodesk more predictable revenue to manage its capital and to make its spending more efficiently optimized under predictable revenue. More affordable to larger user group: The subscription will result in much less short term cost to use the software. This is especially friendly for small scale companies which are not able to purchase multiple copies of thousands dollars software. The subscription will be more widely accepted by those users and thus further expand Autodesk's market share. Less risk of piracy: As the software is subscription based, the software will renew its licence every time user go online. This means that for those who pirate the software have to renew their fake licence every time they use it. Further, the subscription will make software more accessible to the anti piracy updates Autodesk releases. The subscription will make piracy of the software less feasible and thus guarantee more revenue to Autodesk. We regard this crucial as Autodesk is rapidly expanding to emerging markets where piracy is prevalent. The subscription will help to guarantee more return from piracy in those regions. Easier to expanding cloud services: Because of the subscription, users can install copies of software into multiple devices at home or at the office. It will be more natural for users to complete their work at one place and sync it to other devices when they log in to their subscriptions on other devices. Enterprise license subscription also allows cloud file sharing across multiple users, making online collaboration through Autodesk cloud more crucial to the design teams. In this way, the cloud service Autodesk 360 will be easily accepted by the users and thus will be another crucial source of income in the future as user fidelity become firm. 
 Autodesk's current stock price drop mainly results from its change of business model. As its major CAD software switch from one time licensing to subscription, Autodesk is facing the issue of lack of subscribers and the short term defer of its revenue. Lack of subscribers is the current issue that Autodesk is facing. 

 From the graph one can observe that Autodesk's revenue peaks at mid 2015 and dramatically decreased after mid 2016. We interpret the trend as a result of its switching to subscription model. Autodesk receives nearly constant revenue before 2014 because if its stable sales performance. However, after it first announced the plan for subscription during mid 2014, more perspective users crowded to buy one time licence which result in its growth from mid 2014 to 2015. After the mania of licence starts to discharge, the future users who Autodesk foresees going to buy its subscriptions already has life long license. As a result, Autodesk receives less initial subscribers and did not get stable revenue after switching. The short term deferral of its revenue is because of the nature of subscription which is the payment of the licence will be spread out and result in less one time revenue within a quarter. Traditionally, when a user is buying the software one time, he or she will have to pay more than thousand dollars at one time to gain the licence. These one time payments offers huge revenue and cash flow for the Autodesk. When it comes to subscription, users only pays half hundred a month, as a result, with the price of the software spread out, the short term revenue is diluted. Our counter argument for lack of subscribers is that Autodesk is gaining a subscription growth. Autodesk reports that there are 24% subscription growth during Q4 of 2016 compared with other quarters. And the subscription growth is getting stronger in the first quarter of 2017. Even though Autodesk projects the revenue loss contributed by subscription is not expecting to recover due to the promotional discount of the subscription, it is highly expectable for future strong revenue growth after gaining a huge amount of subscribers.
 The deferred revenue due to the nature of subscription will also be compensated in the long run. Furthermore, The advantage of subscription brings more steady monthly income and less possibility for pirating. 

 A comparable example is Adobe. Both Adobe and Autodesk are software companies which dominate its field. As Adobe switched its model from one time licensing to subscription during mid 2013, one can see similar trend of short term revenue losses in the graph. However, After Adobe's subscribers increases, its gains huge improvement of revenue afterwards. And we project Autodesk will have similar success as Adobe. Evaluation and Projected Growth The way we model Autodesk's projected growth is by comparing its predecessor Adobe. 

 The graph shows the stock price of the two companies in the five year period. The two triangles mark the time two companies switch to their subscription model as they are today. As claimed in the previous part, Adobe is comparable with Autodesk in its company profile side because both of these companies are industrial standard professional software developer. They all have market dominating products (Adobe's Creative Cloud Product line VS Autodesk's Engineering and Manufacturing product line). Further, Both of those companies switched their business model from lifetime licensing to subscription. From the graph, in the technical side, both of those companies' stock price experienced drop during the switch period and then recovered.
 As Adobe projected about 4 times growth after switching to subscription in 3-year-period, we offer a relatively similar projection of Autodesk's growth of about 3.5 times achieving projected price of $140 per share counting for dividends in 3 years. As Autodesk's current price stays around $86 per share, we can still expect 63% growth in three years. Investment Summary Highlights We recommend to take a long position of Autodesk for a 3 year period for about 63% growth. The major theme of the investment is that Autodesk is the leading software developer in CAD and media entertainment area with its industrial standard software. As Autodesk have just changed its operation business model to subscription licensing from lifetime licensing of its major products. This new model will offer Autodesk more consistent long term revenue and will secure its growth in the emerging market.About this article:ExpandAuthor payment: $35 + $0.01/page view.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Sector Rank assigns a rating to each of the 16 Sectors based on their average Zacks Rank.
A sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Autodesk Inventor 2017 is optimized to take advantage of the SSE2 extended instruction sets supported on Pentium 4, AMD Athlon 64, and AMD Opteron processors. Inventor 2017 will not install on computers that do not support SSE2. Several utilities are available on the Internet that report CPUID including supported instructions sets.
Autodesk recommends settings which allow Microsoft Windows to manage virtual memory as needed. There should always be at least twice as much free hard disk space as system memory (RAM).
DVD-ROM drive is not required if installing from USB or software download.
The multimedia learning components of the Inventor Help system, such as the UI Video Tour, Command Reference, and Show Me animations, require Adobe Flash Player 10. If it is not already installed, you can download it from the Adobe website.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
