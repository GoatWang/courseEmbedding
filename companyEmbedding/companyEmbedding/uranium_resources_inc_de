FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Industry Terms
        



                        Claim
                    

A claim is a tract of land, the right to mine of which is held under the Federal General Mining Law of 1872 and applicable local laws.




                        Concentrates
                    

A product from a uranium production and milling facility, which is commonly referred to as uranium concentrate or U3O8.




                        Conversion
                    

A process whereby uranium concentrates are converted into forms suitable for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.




                        Cut-off grade
                    

Cut-off grade is determined by the following formula parameters: estimates over the relevant period of project costs, ore treatment costs, general and administrative costs, refining costs, royalty expenses, process and refining recovery rates and uranium prices.




                        Gross acres
                    

Total acres under which we have mineral rights and can recover uranium.




                        Indian Country
                    

A term derived from jurisdictional determinations in criminal law enforcement proceedings under 18 U.S.C.  § 1151 and understood to encompass territory situated within Indian reservations, land owned by Indian allottees and land within a dependent Indian community.




                        Mineralized material
                    

A mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support a sufficient tonnage and average grade. Such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve, until a comprehensive evaluation based upon unit cost, grade, recoveries, and other material factors conclude legal and economic feasibility.




                        Net acres
                    

Actual acres under lease which may differ from gross acres when fractional mineral interests are not leased.




                        Ore
                    

Naturally occurring material from which a mineral or minerals of economic value can be extracted at a reasonable profit.




                        Over feeding
                    

Operating enrichment plants in a manner that reduces plant operating costs but increases the amount of uranium required to produce a given quantity of enriched uranium.




                        Probable reserves
                    

Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.




                        Proven reserves
                    

Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.




                        Reclamation
                    

Reclamation involves the returning of the surface area of the recovery and wellfield operating areas to a condition similar to pre-mining.




                        Recoverable reserves
                    

Reserves that are either proven or probable, are physically minable and can be profitably recovered under conditions specified at the time of the appraisal, based on a positive feasibility study. The calculation of usable reserves is adjusted for potential recovery and dilution.




                        Reserve
                    

That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.




                        Restoration
                    

Restoration involves returning an aquifer to a condition consistent with our pre-extraction use and removing evidences of surface disturbance. The restoration of a wellfield can be accomplished by flushing the ore zone with native ground water and/or using reverse osmosis to remove ions to provide clean water for reinjection to flush the ore zone.




                        Resources
                    

A resource is a concentration of naturally occurring minerals in such a form that economic extraction is potentially feasible.




                        Roll front
                    

The configuration of sedimentary uranium ore bodies as they appear within the host sand. A term that depicts an elongate uranium ore mass that is 'C' shaped.




                        Shut in
                    

A term that refers to ceasing production or the absence of production.




                        Shut-in royalty
                    

A lease clause permitting the extension of a lease not held by production by payment of a per-acre royalty.




                        Slurry
                    

Fine particles of uranium concentrated and suspended in water.




                        Spot price
                    

The price at which uranium may be purchased for delivery within one year.




                        Surety obligations
                    

A bond, letter of credit, or financial guarantee posted by a party in favor of a beneficiary to ensure the performance of its or another party's obligations, e.g., reclamation bonds, workers' compensation bond, or guarantees of debt instruments.




                        Tailings
                    

Waste material from a mineral processing mill after the metals and minerals of a commercial nature have been extracted; or that portion of the ore which remains after the valuable minerals have been extracted.




                        Uranium or uranium concentrates
                    

U3O8 or triuranium octoxide.




                        U3O8


Triuranium octoxide equivalent contained in uranium concentrates, referred to as uranium concentrate.




                        Waste

South Texas Properties
Uranium Resources currently controls three production properties and several exploration projects in South Texas.

Uranium Resources began operations in 1977 in the South Texas uranium province. The Company has successfully completed several projects in the region, including completion of full restoration of the Longoria and Benavides projects.  The Company has produced over eight million pounds of uranium over various extended periods beginning in the 1980s until 2009 when production was suspended at the Company’s Kingsville Dome Project due to unfavorable market conditions.
The Company’s Rosita and Kingsville Dome processing facilities remain on standby for a potential restart of production when there is a sustained recovery in uranium prices. The Vasquez Project is depleted and undergoing well field stabilization.
In addition, the Company strengthened its path to production with the addition of five exploration projects in the South Texas uranium province with characteristics amenable for potential in-situ recovery of uranium. All five projects are within 75 miles of the Company’s licensed Rosita and Kingsville Dome processing facilities.
