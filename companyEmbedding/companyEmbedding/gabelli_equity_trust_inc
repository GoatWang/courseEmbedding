Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Gabelli Equity Trust, Inc. (The) (NYSE:GAB) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Fund Overview for Equity Trust








Objective

    The Gabelli Equity Trust is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company whose investment objective is long term growth of capital, with income as a secondary objective. Investments will be made based on management's perception of their potential for capital appreciation. The Fund seeks out undervalued companies with greater than average potential for growth. 
 The Equity Trust maintains a 10% Distribution Policy whereby the Trust pays out to common shareholders 10% of its average net assets each year.  This distribution is paid quarterly.  The distribution rate is not representative of dividend yield or the total return of the Fund and may include a return of capital.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.
