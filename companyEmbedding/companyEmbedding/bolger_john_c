                    Funeral Rule @ John C Bolger Funeral Home


                    A funeral can be one of the most expensive purchases one may ever have to make. Having little to no knowledge of the industry, coupled with the added time pressure and emotional duress a person could easily be fooled and taken advantage of. John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc must comply with the "Funeral Rule" or face the possibility of federal trade commission complaints being filed.
                    The "funeral rule" was enacted in 1984 and is designed to ensure that all funeral homes including John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc provides consumers adequate information with regards to the products and services they are charged for.
                    As part of the "Funeral Rule", John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc will provide you with a General Price List (GPL) that includes but not limited to, the expenses of funeral service items such as transportation to the cemetery and viewing or visitation services.
                    A general price list is available free of charge to any person who inquires in person at John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc about funeral arrangements, regardless of their intent to purchase funeral services or not.
~ The Funeral Rule



Faq's @ John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc
 

 Questions such as "Which of the rituals should I attend?",
                    "When should I visit?",
                    "What should I say, or not say",
                    "Do I make a phone call?", are common questions for most Family and Friends during this time.
                    Understanding terms such as "Funeral Service", "Private Service" or "Memorial Service" can be confusing as well.
                    "Who creates the Eulogy?", "What is an appropriate dress code?", "Can I, or should I bring my Children?" are common questions as well.
                    Contact John C Bolger Funeral Home Inc in Martinsburg, PA to help answer these questions. You may also find that online funeral resources can be helpful as well.
