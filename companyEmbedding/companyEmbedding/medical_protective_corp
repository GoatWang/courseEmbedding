What saw me through those difficult times was the sage guidance of my excellent legal representation and MedPro's compassionate claims manager. I am happy my practice chose MedPro Group."

Part of practitioners' role in patient care includes setting standards and expectations for effective relationships. Pain management contracts are a tool that helps facilitate this process.  Pain contracts should be specific and directly related to the patient's pain management plan/program. Providers also might want to incorporate specific statements about behaviors to avoid. Below are examples of behavioral expectations that might be included in a pain contract. Read more        Opioid Prescribing: Navigating Through a Crisis  In recent years, opioids have become a hot button issue in healthcare. The use of these powerful analgesics has risen dramatically over the past 15 years, and misuse has led to an epidemic of opioid overdoses and a national heroin crisis. Read more   Healthcare's Second Victims: A Problem That Should Not Be Ignored  In any discussion of managing unanticipated outcomes in healthcare, including medical errors, the immediate concern is supporting patients who are affected by these incidents. Patients are considered the "first victims" of unanticipated outcomes, and healthcare organizations and providers have a duty to provide them with truthful information, follow-up care, and emotional support. Read more   Documenting Unanticipated Outcomes: An Essential Part of the Disclosure Process  Documentation is a critical aspect of healthcare delivery because it memorializes patient care, facilitates communication among caregivers, forms the basis for coding and billing, provides data pertinent to quality improvement, and may provide information that is critical to the defense of a legal action. Read more   Risk Strategies for Disclosing an Unanticipated Outcome  Disclosing an unanticipated outcome to a patient/family can be daunting and stressful. Healthcare providers may worry about the possibility of litigation, damage to their reputations, workplace consequences, or even just upsetting patients/families.

In a survey of more than 800 physicians and physician leaders, more than 70 percent of participants said that disruptive physician behavior occurs at least once a month at their organizations, and more than 10 percent of participants said that such incidents occur on a daily basis. Read more   Red Flags for Disruptive Behavior in Healthcare Professionals  Sadly, disruptive behavior among healthcare professionals and staff is not uncommon, and it represents a serious patient safety concern. According to the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the majority of healthcare professionals have encountered colleagues engaging in disruptive behaviors with coworkers, patients, relatives, and others. Read more   Nonverbal Communication as an Essential Element of Patient-Centered Care  Effective verbal communication is the bedrock of quality, patient-centered care. Healthcare providers and staff undoubtedly are aware of the continued emphasis and importance placed on verbal communication through various quality measures and standards.

Value: $825 million
Parties: Kansas City-based GE Insurance Solutions and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. of Omaha




 


Summary: GE Insurance Solutions' sale of Medical Protective Corp., based in Fort Wayne, Ind., to Berkshire Hathaway's National Indemnity division, was announced in May and closed June 30. The deal did not affect any of the insurers' area employees.





Insurance: GE said the transaction will help reduce its position in insurance and let it focus on property and casualty reinsurance and other specialized lines. Berkshire Hathaway obtains an increasing position in medical malpractice insurance. Medical Protective, founded in 1899, is a professional liability insurer serving 75,000 doctors and dentists. The firm recorded 2004 gross written premiums of $737 million and has 330 employees. Medical Protective's products are distributed through a nationwide network of employee market managers and appointed agents.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
