NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Klein Law Firm announces that a class action complaint has been

      filed in the United States District Court for the District of New

      In particular, the complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period,

      misleading investors about DEXTENZA manufacturing issues, including that

      product; (2) such manufacturing issues could impact the approval of 
      DEXTENZA by the FDA; and (3) as a result, defendants’ public statements 
      were materially false and misleading.
    

      Shareholders have until September 5, 2017 to petition the court 
      for lead plaintiff status. Your ability to share in any recovery does 
      not require that you serve as lead plaintiff. You may choose to be an

      additional information, please contact Joseph Klein, Esq. by telephone

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc.  Join Class Action » 

The Pawar Law Group announces a class action lawsuit on behalf of General Cable Corporation (BGC) investors who purchased General Cable stock between May 5, 2017 and July 11, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”). The suit is for recovery of investor losses.
No class has been certified in the above action yet. Until certification occurs, you are not represented by an attorney. You may choose to take no action and remain a passive class member.
Press Release
According to the complaint, throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Ocular’s management has been misleading investors about DEXTENZA manufacturing issues, including that more than 50% of lots manufactured by Ocular contain bad product; (2) such manufacturing issues could imperil the approval of DEXTENZA by the FDA; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On July 6, 2017, Seeking Alpha published an article concerning DEXTENZA manufacturing issues. On that same day, STAT published an article asserting that DEXTENZA could be rejected by the FDA because of product contamination. On this news, shares of Ocular Therapeutix fell $3.06 per share or over 30% over two trading days to close at $7.12 per share on July 7, 2017, damaging investors. On July 11, 2017, Ocular disclosed that it received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA stating “that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form.” On this news, shares of Ocular fell $0.93 per share or over 12% to close at $6.67 per share on July 12, 2017, further damaging investors.

					Full Description



Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., incorporated on September 12, 2006, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using its hydrogel platform technology. The Company's bioresorbable hydrogel based product candidates are designed to provide sustained delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Its lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP, for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which are extended-delivery, drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. It also has an intravitreal hydrogel depot, which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).DEXTENZA incorporates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting insert for intracanalicular use. DEXTENZA is also in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. DEXTENZA is in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease. OTX-TP incorporates travoprost, which is an FDA-approved prostaglandin analogue in eye drop form that reduces elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. It is engaged in the preclinical development of its hydrogel depot administered through intravitreal injection. Its product, ReSure Sealant, is a topical liquid hydrogel that creates a temporary, adherent, soft and lubricious sealant to prevent post-surgical leakage from clear corneal incisions that are made during cataract surgery.

On that same day, STAT published an article asserting that DEXTENZA could be rejected by the FDA because of product contamination. On this news, shares of Ocular Therapeutix fell $3.06 per share or over 30% over two trading days to close at $7.12 per share on July 7, 2017, damaging investors.
