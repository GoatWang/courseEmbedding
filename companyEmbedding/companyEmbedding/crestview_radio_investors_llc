Cumulus Media Inc. and Crestview Partners Announce Formation of 
      Cumulus Radio Investors, L.P.




      Strategic Investment Partnership Will Target $1 Billion in Radio 
      Investments
    





April 07, 2010 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cumulus Media Inc. [NASDAQ: CMLS], the second largest radio broadcast 
      company in the United States based on station count, and Crestview 
      Partners, a $4 billion private equity firm with a strong media focus, 
      today announced the formation of a strategic investment partnership that 
      will seek to invest in premium radio broadcasting companies that present 
      attractive opportunities for significant long-term capital appreciation. 
      The partnership’s objective is to deliver significant value and achieve 
      attractive returns through Cumulus' proven skills in radio station 
      management and operations, as well as its proprietary technology 
      platform.
    

      Under the terms of the partnership, Crestview will lead an investor 
      group that would invest up to $500 million in equity in the partnership, 
      to be called Cumulus Radio Investors, L.P. (“CRI”). Together with debt 
      financing expected to be available through the capital markets, CRI 
      could target acquisitions totaling in excess of $1 billion. Cumulus 
      would provide all management, financial, operational and corporate 
      services to the partnership and its operations pursuant to a management 
      services agreement. Cumulus will be compensated through management fees 
      as well as incentive compensation based on investment returns. Cumulus 
      successfully formed a similar private partnership, Cumulus Media 
      Partners LLC (“CMP”), in 2006 with three other leading private equity 
      funds to acquire the radio broadcasting business of Susquehanna 
      Pfaltzgraff Company in a transaction valued at approximately $1.2 
      billion.
    

      Cumulus Chairman, President and CEO, Lew Dickey, commented: “We are 
      pleased to announce the formation of Cumulus Radio Investors in 
      partnership with Crestview and other investors to uniquely combine the 
      synergies of one of the largest radio broadcast companies with the 
      backing of a strong financial sponsor whose senior partners, Thomas 
      Murphy, Jr. and Jeffrey Marcus, have significant investing and operating 
      experience in the radio industry. We will be deliberate and disciplined 
      in our investment approach, but we are prepared to move quickly to 
      capitalize on the strategic investment opportunities that we believe are 
      available today.”
    

      Jeffrey Marcus and Thomas Murphy, Jr., both partners of Crestview, said: 
      “Crestview is excited to partner with Lew Dickey and the rest of the 
      Cumulus Media management team to pursue investments in the radio 
      industry. The Cumulus Media team has demonstrated the ability to grow 
      radio businesses while achieving significant operational efficiencies. 
      We are confident that our investment and operating experience in the 
      radio industry combined with Cumulus Media’s management capabilities and 
      strong technology platform will lead to compelling investment 
      opportunities.”

Consensus Ratings for Cumulus Media (NASDAQ:CMLS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A
