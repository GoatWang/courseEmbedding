 PTC THERAPEUTICS, INC. (NASDAQ:PTCT) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

 On May 5, 2017, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) entered into a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (MidCap), as administrative agent and MidCap and certain other financial institutions as lenders thereunder (the Credit Agreement) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $60.0 million, of which $40.0 million was drawn by the Company on May 5, 2017. The remaining $20.0 million under the senior secured term loan facility will become available to the Company upon its demonstration (on or prior to December 31, 2018) of net product revenue equaling or exceeding $120.0 million for the trailing 12 month period. Interest Rate. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor rate of 1.00%) plus 6.15%. Amortization and Final Maturity. The Company is obligated to make only interest payments (payable monthly in arrears) through April 30, 2019. Commencing on May 1, 2019 and continuing for the remaining twenty-four months of the facility, the Company will be required to make monthly interest payments and monthly principal payments based on the straight-line amortization schedule set forth in the Credit Agreement, subject to certain adjustments as described therein. The final maturity date under the Credit Agreement is May 1, 2021, unless earlier terminated. Mandatory Prepayments. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to dedicate 50% of certain insurance proceeds to the prepayment of outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions and net of certain expenses and repayments. Voluntary Prepayments. The Company may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement, in whole but not in part, at any time upon 15 days written notice. Prepayment Fees. In connection with both mandatory and voluntary prepayments, the Company will be required to pay a prepayment fee equal to (i) 3.00% of the outstanding principal of such advance, if the prepayment is made within twelve months of the date of such advance, (ii) 2.00% of the outstanding principal of such advance, if the prepayment is made between twelve months and twenty-four months after the date of such advance or (iii) 1.00% of the outstanding principal of such advance, if the prepayment is made later than twenty-four months after the date of such advance. Security. Subject to customary exceptions and exclusions, all obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured to the terms of the Credit Agreement, a Pledge Agreement between the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and MidCap (the Pledge Agreement), and an Intellectual Property and Security Agreement between the Company and MidCap (the IP Security Agreement and together with the Credit Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, the Financing Agreements), each dated May 5, 2017. Under the Financing Agreements, the Company provides to MidCap and the other lenders:






 a perfected, first-priority security interest in all of the Companys personal property, including, without limitation, all of the Companys goods, accounts, equipment, inventory, contract rights or rights of payment of money, leases, license agreements, franchise agreements, commercial tort claims, documents, instruments, chattel paper, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, fixtures, letter of credit rights, securities, and all other investment property, supporting obligations, financial assets and all books and records related to the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions and limitations;









 a perfected, first-priority security interest in all of the Companys intellectual property (except that this security interest will not be perfected in intellectual property located outside the United States unless the Companys cash position falls below a pre-specified threshold), including, without limitation, any and all copyright rights, copyright applications, copyright registrations and like protection, trade secrets, design rights, patents, patent applications and like protections, trademark and servicemark rights, mask works or similar rights and any and all claims for damages, licenses or other rights, and proceeds and products related to the foregoing; and









 a perfected, first-priority pledge of 65% of the equity ownership interests directly held by the Company in PTC Therapeutics Holdings (Bermuda) Corp. Limited.
