The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

HIMSS Las Vegas: First-Time Attendee Impressions

Last week our team had its first introduction to the world of the HIMSS annual conference.   For those who aren’t familiar, HIMSS is the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a large trade organization that brings together tens of thousands of individuals, corporations, and organizations under the banner of “better health through technology.”

Patient Engagement:  Shoulda Put a Ring on It

As a newcomer to the medical technology industry, I went to HIMSS16 with no expectations, or as few as possible (I expected people to talk about technology in medicine, but that was about it). It quickly became clear to me that there are several buzz-phrases that exist in Health Information Technology right now.

Because Tech Isn’t For Poor People Anyways, Right?
I work for a tech company that serves Medicaid.
A simple sentence that reads one part contradiction and one part complete mystery.  On the contradiction: No one in tech works with people or companies concerned with Medicaid. On the complete mystery: In the last week alone, when explaining my work, someone asked if Medicaid and Medicare were the same, someone else if Medicaid was invented by the ACA, and a third asked, “but Medicaid’s not a thing anymore because of Obamacare, right?”

Reflections on a Conference

Two weeks ago, members of our team attended the 2015 NASUAD Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Conference. The conference, focused on in-home care primarily funded through Medicare/Medicaid brought together a diverse set of healthcare players: insurance plan executives, state administrators, nurse care-giver contractors, device vendors and many more. After a multitude of presentations, plenaries, networking sessions, unexpectedly rowdy receptions, and a welcomed long weekend of reflection, here are some stray thoughts from the conference:

Will We Overregulate Ourselves Out of Innovation?

Digital security is one of the most pressing issues on the minds of both the private sector and the public sector. But many technology experts are finding the potential limits that stringent policies on data and encryption might place on innovation even more concerning than the data protection and privacy issues they mean to address. Simple features that feel familiar to us all like searching for something on the web or in an app are threatened not by good security but by oversecurity.

Leadership











Amanda HavardCEOTwitterLinkedInSend an EmailAmanda Havard is a second-generation tech entrepreneur with a passion for finding innovative and disruptive technological solutions that create streamlined user experiences. She has history of using her so-called Zero Interface app architecture for improving upon and recreating established formats and practices in legacy industries. Her ventures have focused on technological evolution by drawing on her background and research in cognitive development to critically consider the logistics, use, and architecture of technology.
She co-founded Health: ELT with her father, a legendary healthcare entrepreneur and disrupter. Quickly renowned in the field, she has spoken on the subject at the national conferences for the Medicaid Health Plans of America, in both 2014 and 2015 at the National Association for States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) annual meetings on Home and Community Based Services, and she is forthcoming a faculty speaker for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) annual conference in 2016. She was recently nominated to the Office of the National Coordinator’s Health IT Strategy committee by Louisiana Medicaid’s Chief Medical Officer, the Executive Director of NASUAD, and a C-suite executive at Centene, the largest Medicaid health plan in the country. She has been invited by state officials and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to talk about innovation, technology, and accountability in public health endeavors.
She is also the Founder and Creative Director for Immersedition, an intelligent interactive book format which draws on her own experience as a fiction writer to help rethink the traditional reader experience by connecting the book to relevant material outside the text itself in a dynamic, intuitive way.
Both of these initiatives draw extensively on her background and training in cognitive development at Vanderbilt University, including her work as a fellow with Vanderbilt’s Peabody Research Institute. She graduated from Vanderbilt with honors with both her Bachelor’s of Science in 2008 and her Master of Education in 2010. She holds two patent-pendings for technology and methodology she has architected and developed as a part of her two entrepreneurial startup endeavors.
L. Cade HavardExecutive ChairmanLinkedInSend an EmailL. Cade Havard is an entrepreneur and visionary who has built and led many companies from startup through high growth phases. Distinguished by his vast knowledge and application of sound operational and management principles, and work with diverse financial models in disruptive spaces, Cade has a history of inciting innovative change in legacy industries.
He currently serves as Executive Chairman of Health: ELT, a company that provides Medicaid engagement, logistics, and technology services and products that aim to tackle the most significant problems facing Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) today. Through the integrated use of web dashboard tools and mobile apps for use in home health and field assessing, Health: ELT offers MCOs a chance to better coordinate care for members, gain detailed insight into their own medical data, and more effectively engage members in their own healthcare.
He has worked with computers since his first job running a mainframe in 1969. His earliest codewriting dates back to 1971. After spearheading small revolutions in programming for a variety of companies, he ventured into investment banking, venture capital, and mergers and acquisitions, garnering extensive experience in each area.
But for the past 20 years, his core focus has been healthcare services and technologies. His start in healthcare began when he founded Sterling National Corporation, which provided factoring services to many types of entities. Learning of the complex procedures and payments of health insurance companies and PPOs, Cade saw a unique opportunity to apply his disruptive vision and expertise to a new industry segment.
Capitalizing on experience gained from this innovative step, Cade founded Electronic Transmission Corporation (ETC) in 1994 to provide computer automation services for medical claims. He successfully pioneered the first automation model fueled by the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on medical claims, which was massively innovative at the time and has gone on to become the industry standard for service companies and healthcare vendors today. The first to apply Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to healthcare information and claims, he was able to automate the process and bring an entire industry into the future. The model he developed was used by such companies as Wal-Mart, MAPCO, Champion International, Reynolds & Reynolds, and Borden’s.
In 1998, Cade founded ECOM-PPO by engineering a better way to select and manage PPO relationships for claims payers. His work resulted in saving billions of dollars on medical spending over the course of a decade while helping patients retain continuity of care. He grew this company out of an investment of $763,000 from two friends who netted over $11 Million from their investment across Cade’s ten-year tenure at ECOM. The company was sold to Goldman Sachs in 2008.
After leaving ECOM, he invested diversely in several ventures across digital media and interactive technologies, Medicaid engagement services, and provider database management. In 2013, Cade had a clear vision of a synergy between these three industries and business models. He would go on to form Health: ELT at this exact intersection, where sleek, consumer-styled mobile apps and web tools could connect sophisticated databases, analytics, and modeling to inform those who served Medicaid populations. Founding Health ELT with his daughter, a young veteran of the most forwardthinking utilization and development of touchscreen technologies, the two have taken great strides to enable health plans to make Medicaid a more effective, streamlined, and accountable form of healthcare.
Clayton GulickChief Technology OfficerLinkedInSend an EmailClayton Gulick is an experienced technical leader and entrepreneur with over 20 years of industry expertise. Clayton has helped guide and develop the technology that drove several startups to success, as well as powering Fortune 500 companies. From embedded systems on 8-bit microcontrollers, to large scale social networks, to medical claims processing and EHR systems, Clayton has demonstrated a depth of technical knowledge rarely seen in the industry.
A military veteran, Clayton learned at a young age important lessons about quality leadership that he continues to apply to his management style today. He believes that high quality software starts with a high quality development team, and he recruits only the finest developers for his projects.
At Health ELT, Clayton has coupled the best developers with the most cutting edge technology available, and the result has been the revolutionary healthcare engagement and logistics platform that Amanda and Cade Havard envisioned. Combining the power of advanced geospatial visualization and analytics with future facing mobile technology, the Coord platform is poised to completely redefine Medicaid and Medicare member management, assessment and care delivery.

Bringing Nashville's "maker movement" to MedicaidIt wouldn’t be surprising to see employees of Health ELT wearing shirts that read “#WhatAboutMedicaid.”
The staff of Health ELT, an engagement and logistics technology firm, may not have those shirts yet, but given the level of devotion to a wonky program from people with non-health-care backgrounds, maybe shirts will come soon. And those shirts would probably be locally made and designed by a local artist.
Read Full StoryJuly 29, 2015•Holly FletcherLet’s Bring “Quantified Health” to Populations That Need ItWearable fitness trackers and their complementary smartphone apps are taking the world by storm. There is breathless media coverage and a growing army of gadgets ranging from glorified pedometers to glucose-monitoring contact lenses. While at least one in five Americans now has a wearable device and two thirds intend to use digital tools to track some aspect of their health, and the trend shows no sign of slowing with 68.1 million wearable devices estimated to be produced in 2015, the actual health benefits of these tools have not materialized for everyone.
Read Full StoryAugust 8, 2015•Imran CronkStartup Focuses On Medicaid Engagement, Logistics, And Technology ServicesPatient engagement is the new buzz word in healthcare, and when it is used in commercial insurance plans it could mean anything from incentives for health behavior to providing consumer pricing and quality tools. But, as Cade Havard, chairman and CEO of Health:ELT explains, “In Medicaid, it means ‘see if you can find me,’” according to MedCity News.
Read Full StoryNovember 26, 2014•Christine KernWant to slash Medicaid waste? Reach those patientsOn any given day, less than 40 percent of those on Medicaid – 72.6 million nationally, at last count – can be located by states and health plans. That’s a pitiful percentage of a population that’s often dealing with significant health issues, from multiple chronic conditions to lack of access to basic healthcare services, and whose typical experience with healthcare is a trip to the emergency room. And that’s why Medicaid represents both a huge healthcare bill and a prime example of waste.

Web Dashboard

Able to run on any current browser, the Dashboard is the tool for any in-office stakeholder: schedulers, supervisors, care coordinators, administrative staff, service coordinators who work both in-field and in-office, and any other relevant personnel. Its main function is to show people moving around on a map in real-time while also providing access to member and employee information, member assessment due dates for triage purposes, scheduling and rescheduling capabilities, and much more. This all-encompassing dashboard improves compliance, reduces frustration, and enables efficiency in the field by making scheduling geo-location based and thus far easier.













Field Assessor Tools

The Coord app arms providers and health care workers in the field with advanced tools for data collection and patient care. The Coord field app can use video, photo, and audio recording functions to assist in risk assessment and ongoing monitoring. It eliminates paperwork. Coordinators and caregivers can add media documenting a patient’s condition from the field, allowing health plans to achieve enhanced case management by reviewing member progress at any given moment.
Coord’s field assessment apps simplify the complicated and often inconsistent process of functional-needs and level-of-care assessment. Complex questions and rigid formats are transformed into simple, fluid, user-directed conversations, helping the patient feel more comfortable, all while streamlined, logical interpretations of tricky systems and score structures yield more honest, more accurate, and more consistent results.
Scoring is automated and done on the back end, eliminating human error and increasing accuracy while curbing fraud, waste, and abuse. Each screen is entirely customizable per a client’s needs, and each checkbox corresponds to the correct score. These scores are linked into Coord’s Rain Barrel database, so that the complete details of each assessment live within a member’s file year after year, facilitating detailed predictive analysis while still meeting any reporting requirements.













Member Profile

All member info is aggregated and arranged intuitively in the Member Profile. If it is accessible, from state databases to Lexis Nexis info, it is able to be incorporated into the Member Profile’s signature UX.  This helps immensely with elevating engagement rates. Then again, so does the mobile engagement conversation at the beginning of every app-based visit. This way, you have more information on your members to better care for them, reach them, educate them, schedule them, and more.
What is our Rain Barrel data approach? 
Exactly what it sounds like: catches data from anywhere, pulls it together to live in a central place, and pipes it out only where it needs to go. Efficient, complete, and where you need it.












Mobile Care Apps

Perfect for personal care and assisting services in the home, our customizable mobile care apps provide any home health worker with a quick checklist and the necessary information they need to complete a visit. More importantly, they serve as automatic, accurate portrayals of who was in each home and when, giving accurate, clear validation of care provided — all in real time.













Hedis Alerts

Housing all of a patient’s information in a central location allows for easy and effortless HEDIS alert systems. The Coord dashboard will automatically generate an alert when a member is due for a HEDIS measure, or even when a Coord-user provider is sending someone to a home or site for other services, facilitating a streamlined system to reach HEDIS compliance. Alerts to Coord mobile apps enable health plans to communicate with those who interface with members, allowing service coordinators to complete HEDIS measures efficiently while other assessments or visits are already scheduled.












Engagement Member Apps & Services

Our Coord engagement tools revolutionize the way members request and receive care, the way health plans provide, assess, and validate care, and most importantly improve the quality of care. Patient information living in the Coord Rain Barrel is a key component. Accessible, complete patient data equates to better decisions for patient care. Better decisions increase care and save costs by making everyone more accountable, which is what Coord is all about.
The Coord team of digital engagement strategists design apps to empower plans and states to coordinate care for specific, often unreachable populations. The right information allows plans to better educate members while fostering a relationship that is both continuous and engaging. Coord tools break down the barriers between those who need care and those who authorize it.












Locating Members

One of the prime obstacles in both logistics management and member engagement is locating members.  Health: ELT has built a hands-on process that assists health plans, healthcare vendors, and providers in managing the process of locating, contacting, and maintaining contact with members who are difficult to find. The process is centered on a complex and effective process of information gathering, which requires input from relevant but often overlooked sources.
Pairing nicely with the suite of Coord tools, Health: ELT provides this separate, optional service of locating members.
Case Study:

Health: ELT’s proven results provide early warning signals to those who need the information (i.e. Case Managers, PCP, Specialists, etc.) on a real-time basis. Health plans establish the business rules around access and control of information among its employees and providers.
Our tools:

Create predictive models that foresee the greatest unnecessary expenditures to contain costs in the most catastrophic cases
Indicate areas of duplication and waste
Determine which vendors are the most cost-effective
Stratify members by risk to see those with highest likely future needs













One Touch Eligibility

The conventionally complicated, multi-step, several-day process of assessing clients’ Medicaid eligibility is now streamlined in web dashboards that can evaluate eligibility for thousands of members with one click. Coord’s One-Touch eligibility check conveys the most current information from participating state databases in minutes instead of days while eliminating the risks of uncompensated care.
Though this breakthrough is useful for many types of clients, the One-Touch Eligibility technology is most beneficial to our partner provider agencies. It can be used as a stand-alone tool apart from other Coord tools. Contact us for more details.













Provider Suite

Many of our tools that schedule, assess, coordinate, verify, and validate care are as useful for home health agencies and providers as they are for plans. Having an accurate portrayal of care and the ability to access data live in the field gives providers a distinct advantage. When health plans use Health: ELT’s tools, many processes that once required faxes, phone calls, or physical claims reports become concentrated and instant.
Some of our provider tools are free of charge to better streamline health plans’ processes, while others are customizable products made to address needs of a specific home health provider agency.

Coordinators and caregivers can add media documenting a patient’s condition from the field, allowing health plans to achieve enhanced case management by reviewing member progress at any given moment.
Coord’s field assessment apps simplify the complicated and often inconsistent process of functional-needs and level-of-care assessment. Complex questions and rigid formats are transformed into simple, fluid, user-directed conversations, helping the patient feel more comfortable, all while streamlined, logical interpretations of tricky systems and score structures yield more honest, more accurate, and more consistent results.
Scoring is automated and done on the back end, eliminating human error and increasing accuracy while curbing fraud, waste, and abuse. Each screen is entirely customizable per a client’s needs, and each checkbox corresponds to the correct score. These scores are linked into Coord’s Rain Barrel database, so that the complete details of each assessment live within a member’s file year after year, facilitating detailed predictive analysis while still meeting any reporting requirements.













Member Profile

All member info is aggregated and arranged intuitively in the Member Profile. If it is accessible, from state databases to Lexis Nexis info, it is able to be incorporated into the Member Profile’s signature UX.  This helps immensely with elevating engagement rates. Then again, so does the mobile engagement conversation at the beginning of every app-based visit. This way, you have more information on your members to better care for them, reach them, educate them, schedule them, and more.
What is our Rain Barrel data approach? 
Exactly what it sounds like: catches data from anywhere, pulls it together to live in a central place, and pipes it out only where it needs to go. Efficient, complete, and where you need it.












Mobile Care Apps

Perfect for personal care and assisting services in the home, our customizable mobile care apps provide any home health worker with a quick checklist and the necessary information they need to complete a visit. More importantly, they serve as automatic, accurate portrayals of who was in each home and when, giving accurate, clear validation of care provided — all in real time.













Hedis Alerts

Housing all of a patient’s information in a central location allows for easy and effortless HEDIS alert systems. The Coord dashboard will automatically generate an alert when a member is due for a HEDIS measure, or even when a Coord-user provider is sending someone to a home or site for other services, facilitating a streamlined system to reach HEDIS compliance. Alerts to Coord mobile apps enable health plans to communicate with those who interface with members, allowing service coordinators to complete HEDIS measures efficiently while other assessments or visits are already scheduled.












Engagement Member Apps & Services

Our Coord engagement tools revolutionize the way members request and receive care, the way health plans provide, assess, and validate care, and most importantly improve the quality of care. Patient information living in the Coord Rain Barrel is a key component. Accessible, complete patient data equates to better decisions for patient care. Better decisions increase care and save costs by making everyone more accountable, which is what Coord is all about.
The Coord team of digital engagement strategists design apps to empower plans and states to coordinate care for specific, often unreachable populations. The right information allows plans to better educate members while fostering a relationship that is both continuous and engaging. Coord tools break down the barriers between those who need care and those who authorize it.












Locating Members

One of the prime obstacles in both logistics management and member engagement is locating members.  Health: ELT has built a hands-on process that assists health plans, healthcare vendors, and providers in managing the process of locating, contacting, and maintaining contact with members who are difficult to find. The process is centered on a complex and effective process of information gathering, which requires input from relevant but often overlooked sources.
Pairing nicely with the suite of Coord tools, Health: ELT provides this separate, optional service of locating members.
Case Study:

Health: ELT’s proven results provide early warning signals to those who need the information (i.e. Case Managers, PCP, Specialists, etc.) on a real-time basis. Health plans establish the business rules around access and control of information among its employees and providers.
Our tools:

Create predictive models that foresee the greatest unnecessary expenditures to contain costs in the most catastrophic cases
Indicate areas of duplication and waste
Determine which vendors are the most cost-effective
Stratify members by risk to see those with highest likely future needs













One Touch Eligibility

The conventionally complicated, multi-step, several-day process of assessing clients’ Medicaid eligibility is now streamlined in web dashboards that can evaluate eligibility for thousands of members with one click. Coord’s One-Touch eligibility check conveys the most current information from participating state databases in minutes instead of days while eliminating the risks of uncompensated care.
Though this breakthrough is useful for many types of clients, the One-Touch Eligibility technology is most beneficial to our partner provider agencies. It can be used as a stand-alone tool apart from other Coord tools. Contact us for more details.













Provider Suite

Many of our tools that schedule, assess, coordinate, verify, and validate care are as useful for home health agencies and providers as they are for plans. Having an accurate portrayal of care and the ability to access data live in the field gives providers a distinct advantage. When health plans use Health: ELT’s tools, many processes that once required faxes, phone calls, or physical claims reports become concentrated and instant.
Some of our provider tools are free of charge to better streamline health plans’ processes, while others are customizable products made to address needs of a specific home health provider agency.
