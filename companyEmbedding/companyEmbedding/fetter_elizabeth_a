Support.com Appoints Lowell Robinson and Elizabeth Fetter to Board of DirectorsExperienced, skilled independent director additions underscore Board’s commitment to delivering value for stockholders
Redwood City, Calif. – March 15, 2016 – Support.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPRT), makers of award-winning, cloud-based Nexus® software for Support Interaction Optimization (SIO) and a leading provider of tech support and turnkey support center services, today announced the appointment of Lowell Robinson and Elizabeth Fetter, both highly regarded and accomplished business executives with substantial public company board experience, to its Board as new independent directors, effective immediately.
“We couldn’t be more excited to add Lowell and Elizabeth – two stellar directors – to our Board,” said Jim Stephens, Chairman of the Board of Support.com. “These significant board additions, as well as our recent addition of Tim Stanley, come at a pivotal time for the Company and represent our commitment to ensuring that Support.com has the best mix of skills and experience to evaluate how best to drive stockholder value.”
Mr. Robinson’s thirty years of global strategic, financial, turnaround and M&A experience coupled with a strong operational background gained as an executive at well-known public companies, including General Foods (former NYSE:GEFO) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), will provide Support.com with well-informed operational guidance. He has served in senior leadership roles at both public and private technology and software services companies, including at HigherOne (NASDAQ:ONE), where he is Chairman of the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk and Compliance Committee, PRT Group (former NASDAQ:PRTG), and HotJobs (former NASDAQ:HOTJ). Mr. Robinson’s depth of experience will help to guide the continued success of Support.com’s strategy.
“Support.com has a strong platform for growth and significant opportunity to capitalize on a market that is rapidly expanding,” said Mr. Robinson. “I look forward to working with Support.com’s Board and management team to advance the Company’s transformation and explore additional avenues for delivering high-quality customer support products to consumers and enhanced returns to stockholders.”
Ms. Fetter, a five-time CEO, brings significant leadership and technology experience to Support.com, having worked for companies in networking, equipment and B2B SaaS spaces. Since 1999 Liz has held numerous public company board directorships including Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QTM) where she chaired the Compensation Committee and McGrath RentCorp (NASDAQ:MGRC) where she serves on the Audit and Compensation Committees. She’s helped several companies, including QRS Corporation (former NASDAQ:QRSI) and Symmetricom, Inc. (former NASDAQ:SYMM), transition their overall business strategies to unlock revenue growth and value for stockholders. Her deep understanding of core business drivers and their ability to impact companies’ margins and market values will be a valuable contribution to the Support.com board.
“Given the dramatic trends that are rapidly changing the customer support market, Support.com’s potential for growth is enormous, and they have the right building blocks in place to become an industry leader,” said Ms. Fetter. “I’m excited to lend my expertise maximizing operational efficiencies and translating company potential into meaningful results and value for stockholders.”
Both Mr. Robinson and Ms. Fetter will join the Audit Committee, where Mr. Robinson will be Chairman. Mr. Robinson will also serve on the Compensation Committee and Ms. Fetter will also serve on the Strategy Committee. Ms. Fetter and Mr. Robinson replace Martin O’Malley and Shawn Farshchi who, following nearly 20 years of combined service to Support.com, have chosen to step down from the Board.
“Martin’s and Shawn’s strong leadership and industry knowledge have been invaluable to the Board,” continued Mr. Stephens. “On behalf of the entire Board and management team, we thank them for their years of dedicated service and numerous contributions, and we wish them all the best.”
The Support.com Board has determined that Mr. Robinson and Ms. Fetter qualify as “independent director(s)” as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
Support.com strives to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of its stockholders and values their input and opinions. Stockholders interested in learning more about the Company’s strategic initiatives for delivering long-term value, or speaking with a member of the management team should contact Jacob Moelter at +1.650.556.8595.
