Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star.

Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
