Great People.

Show passion for work that matters
Dare to ask “why not” and “what if”

Contact your CLA representative to get started.

The benefits of online storage services
Portals are being used more and more every day. When you do online banking‚ you’re using a portal. Portals are a convenient online storage space in which files can be effortlessly uploaded‚ downloaded‚ stored, and shared in a safe and secure environment. 
CLA offers the same online convenience with our document portal.
Our approach
The CLA document portal is a free resource for clients and gives you instant access to your files, including tax returns, financial statements, and source documents. If you are applying for a loan or need documents for legal purposes, you can quickly and easily access your prior years’ tax returns. 
The portal lets you:


 Easily upload documents of all sizes.
Organize documents in electronic folders, which mirror paper documents storage.
Check out documents while updating so others can’t access the previous version.
Share a range of files, including PDF files, Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheets, Microsoft® Word documents, PowerPoint® presentations, and financial software data files.
Grant rights to others or outside advisors, while restricting access to certain folders if you wish.

Upload other documents for easy access and safekeeping
The CLA document portal lets you store your own financial documents in addition to your tax return and audit documents from CLA. Keep all of your important records in our online portal, so you always know where they are.
The portal is also a safe way to exchange documents electronically. With identity theft on the rise, the portal gives you peace of mind knowing that the only person who can access your files is you and anyone you designate.
View documents anytime, anywhere
As long as you have an internet connection, you can log in to the portal using your computer, laptop, phone, or tablet. Tablets and phones use a simpler format, making it easier to navigate the portal on the smaller screen.
