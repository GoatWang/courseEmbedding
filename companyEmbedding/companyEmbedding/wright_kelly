      Description:     

Wright Williams & Kelly, Inc. (WWK) has three interlinked business units; software products, training programs in support of software products, and professional consulting services. WWK's software business unit develops and markets software products and services that measure and enhance productivity in manufacturing and assembly processes and in the employment of capital resources. WWK modeling and simulation software programs are scaled for either a dedicated process station, a multiple-step process line, or full factory-level capacity. Uncertainty associated with escalating capital costs and rapid changes in product technology has created strong demand for the predictive value of WWK's products and services in capital-intensive high technology industries. WWK products are used by semiconductor device manufacturers; manufacturers of semiconductor process, test, sort, assembly and packaging equipment; suppliers of process materials; and manufacturers of printed circuit boards, flat panel displays, solar panels, MEMS, nano-devices, magnetic discs and other data storage products. The Company's software is also licensed and used by universities, national scientific research centers and private laboratories.
