4 Secrets to Meeting Someone
Our events are designed to make it easy to meet someone. No awkward one-on-one pressure, no games. Learn the 4 secrets.

  

                I would like to thank Events and Adventures (E&A) for some of the best travel events I have ever experienced.  I have found that the E&A staff makes every effort to ensure that we the members have as good and safe an experience as can be provided.
I appreciate from first-hand experience how the hosts for the events will make every effort to accommodate any change in plans requested by a member – we don’t have to “stick to the plan” – we can request a different activity to do on our own if we wish to do so.
Signing up for an event is as easy as a click, and the rest, in most cases, is a done deal.  Sometimes airfare may be extra to get to a “gateway” for a trip departure, but I’m in a frequent flier program, so I can benefit the accumulation of air miles to use in the future.
It’s easy to book travel on your own – but when you travel with E&A, you have an instant family – just add fun!  You always have friends to talk to, or you don’t have to say a word; but who can resist the comfort of friendship?  When we travel together, we’re all there for the same reason: to enjoy the company of our peers.
I also want to thank you for the trips to places I likely would never have gone to otherwise.  Now I can say that I have petted a Koala bear and scuba dived at the Great Barrier Reef of Australia; I’ve walked through the cloudy mist in the steps of the Incas at Machu Picchu; I’ve hiked the Great Wall of China and ridden the new Maglev train to the Shanghai airport at 430 kph!  And I’m looking forward more adventures the future.  I can see that joining E&A was a good choice; and I didn’t know that for certain until after I had the experience of being a member for a while.
So thank you and your staff, now and in the future, for a job well done!
            

                Tom C.            

                A Thank You to E&A

                This was a great event!! Lunch, music and unlimited wine were all provided in the cost of the ticket. It was a small select gathering and we all got to stomp grapes. The winery was beautiful and everyone was so helpful. Should definitely do this one again.

Cirque du Soleil “Amaluna”
Wed, Dec 18, 2013 | Mark.Owen
It's time for a moment of truth. While I know that there are many fans and it is generally loved, I'm not a lover of Cirque.  The production values are great and the music always fun and wonderful, but it's never thrilled me. Thankfully, I was able to see it …

The Events and Adventures Story





When was the last time you described a date as relaxing or fun?
 
 When you are at an Events and Adventures event, it doesn’t seem like dating. When you’re having an adventure, all you want to do is share the experience. There’s no better way to meet someone new.
You don’t have to be a social butterfly. Some of us are introverts too… and proud of it! We just want a fun way to get the ball rolling.
That’s where E&A’s expert event staff can point you in the right direction. With 30-50 local events each month, there’s something for every taste, be it horseback riding, wine tasting, trying the trapeze, or jumping out of a plane.

At Events and Adventures, it’s all about taking online dating offline. Step away from the computer screen, keep your hands where we can see them, and start meeting people face-to-face. You’ll never look back.
More diamonds. Less rough.
Events and Adventures Members in India
We have an excellent screening process here at E&A. The reason we are selective in our membership is because we want you to feel safe. And we don’t want to waste your time.

FRANK 
                H. HAMMOND ADVENTURE CLUB STUDENTS PRODUCE WINNING COMMERCIAL
The Adventure Club promotes creative arts through drama, singing, 
                and dancing. Each year, students at each of the TAC's sites actively 
                participate in making a club commercial. The purpose of the commercial 
                is to tell others about all the fun that happens while attending 
                The Adventure Club including activities such as fun-engineering, 
                creative arts, music, drama house, scientific experiments, and 
                outdoor adventures. 

                This year's winning commercial was produced by The Adventure Club 
                students at Frank H. Hammond-- 

THE ADVENTURE CLUB: MAGIC KINGDOM

                Winning actors will enjoy a pizza party and the TAC's traveling 
                trophy will be at their site until the next competition comes 
                along. Big congratulations to Laura Morris (site coordinator), 
                the staff, and all The Adventure Club students.








Thanks 
              to all of the companies 
              who donated to make Biz Town possible!

THE 
                ADVENTURE CLUB'S SCARECROWS WIN!
Students at The Adventure Club participated in an interactive 
                reading competition through Taltree Arboretum & Gardens. The students 
                selected a story, read the book and decided how best to represent 
                the story in scarecrow form, collected items to build their scarecrow, 
                built it, and then composed a 150 word essay about how the scarecrow 
                best reflects the chosen story.
The Scarecrow Project aligned with many of The Adventure Club's 
                core competencies such as language and literacy, creative arts, 
                problem solving, and engineering.
Although all 11 scarecrow entries from The Adventure Club were 
                terrific, there were many contenders and great competition. Hip, 
                Hip, Hooray! The students at Fieler and Frank H. Hammond won third 
                and fourth place with their scarecrows: Cat in the Hat and The 
                Leggo Man.
Congratulations Fieler and Frank H. Hammond students!

Aligning experiences with our summer theme, "Building 
                Excitement", and focusing on the engineering component 
                of STEM, the summer campers enjoyed planning, designing, and constructing 
                cars. At the Adventure Club, we strive to strengthen children's 
                engineering skills to make problem solving and critical thinking 
                a "habit of mind" for all children. Moving through creating 
                cars, children were involved in scientific process of asking, 
                imagining, planning, creating, and improving.

                Obie after listening to a presentation and watching a video on 
                train safety. 
The miniature Canadian National Locomotive along with accompanying 
                flat car and caboose helped children learn about "Operation 
                Lifesaver", a nationwide program that is sponsored by CN 
                Railroad and dedicated to safety around trains especially 
                at railroad crossings.

                and love for self and others at Peifer and Homan Elementary Schools 
                in Schererville.

											Outdoor Adventure Clubs Of Greater Cincinnati Inc

EVENT: Cincinnati Gives Challenge







THE STORY:


Help Get More Urban Teens Out Into Nature!
Outdoor Adventure Clubs (OAC) is a pioneering organization in our region for providing free outdoor recreation opportunities to students living in urban Greater Cincinnati.  Monthly adventures like kayaking, biking, and hiking take place every weekend and engage 19 schools and hundreds of students in our community - students who otherwise would have limited, if any, access to nature and the great outdoors.  OAC adventures are always free for participants, including activity fees, transportation to the activity venue and lunch during the adventure.
Regular engagement with outdoor recreation improves students physical, mental, and emotional health, plus IT'S FUN!  
What outdoor activities do you love most?  Donate to OAC and share that experience with a local urban teen!
$5 gets a student out on the hiking trails at the Cincinnati Nature Center
$10 gets a kid biking on the Little Miami Bike Trail
$20 gets a kid paddling a kayak down the Little Miami River
$50 gets a kid on the slopes for skiing and snowboarding at Perfect North Slopes
$125 gets a student out for each of our NINE MONTHLY ADVENTURES
$1,000 sponsors an ENTIRE OAC SCHOOL 
Thank you for your support!  Now Go Outside and Play!

4 Secrets to Meeting Someone
Our events are designed to make it easy to meet someone. No awkward one-on-one pressure, no games. Learn the 4 secrets.

  

                I would like to thank Events and Adventures (E&A) for some of the best travel events I have ever experienced.  I have found that the E&A staff makes every effort to ensure that we the members have as good and safe an experience as can be provided.
I appreciate from first-hand experience how the hosts for the events will make every effort to accommodate any change in plans requested by a member – we don’t have to “stick to the plan” – we can request a different activity to do on our own if we wish to do so.
Signing up for an event is as easy as a click, and the rest, in most cases, is a done deal.  Sometimes airfare may be extra to get to a “gateway” for a trip departure, but I’m in a frequent flier program, so I can benefit the accumulation of air miles to use in the future.
It’s easy to book travel on your own – but when you travel with E&A, you have an instant family – just add fun!  You always have friends to talk to, or you don’t have to say a word; but who can resist the comfort of friendship?  When we travel together, we’re all there for the same reason: to enjoy the company of our peers.
I also want to thank you for the trips to places I likely would never have gone to otherwise.  Now I can say that I have petted a Koala bear and scuba dived at the Great Barrier Reef of Australia; I’ve walked through the cloudy mist in the steps of the Incas at Machu Picchu; I’ve hiked the Great Wall of China and ridden the new Maglev train to the Shanghai airport at 430 kph!  And I’m looking forward more adventures the future.  I can see that joining E&A was a good choice; and I didn’t know that for certain until after I had the experience of being a member for a while.
So thank you and your staff, now and in the future, for a job well done!
            

                Tom C.            

                A Thank You to E&A

4 Secrets to Meeting Someone
Our events are designed to make it easy to meet someone. No awkward one-on-one pressure, no games. Learn the 4 secrets.

  

                I would like to thank Events and Adventures (E&A) for some of the best travel events I have ever experienced.  I have found that the E&A staff makes every effort to ensure that we the members have as good and safe an experience as can be provided.
I appreciate from first-hand experience how the hosts for the events will make every effort to accommodate any change in plans requested by a member – we don’t have to “stick to the plan” – we can request a different activity to do on our own if we wish to do so.
Signing up for an event is as easy as a click, and the rest, in most cases, is a done deal.  Sometimes airfare may be extra to get to a “gateway” for a trip departure, but I’m in a frequent flier program, so I can benefit the accumulation of air miles to use in the future.
It’s easy to book travel on your own – but when you travel with E&A, you have an instant family – just add fun!  You always have friends to talk to, or you don’t have to say a word; but who can resist the comfort of friendship?  When we travel together, we’re all there for the same reason: to enjoy the company of our peers.
I also want to thank you for the trips to places I likely would never have gone to otherwise.  Now I can say that I have petted a Koala bear and scuba dived at the Great Barrier Reef of Australia; I’ve walked through the cloudy mist in the steps of the Incas at Machu Picchu; I’ve hiked the Great Wall of China and ridden the new Maglev train to the Shanghai airport at 430 kph!  And I’m looking forward more adventures the future.  I can see that joining E&A was a good choice; and I didn’t know that for certain until after I had the experience of being a member for a while.
So thank you and your staff, now and in the future, for a job well done!
            

                Tom C.            

                A Thank You to E&A
