LEBANON, Ohio, April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Palarum, LLC, a new healthcare IoT technology company, announced it has achieved its goal of securing $3.4 million dollars in non-brokered private funding. The financing will fund the ongoing development and market testing of Palarum's proprietary technology platform designed to enhance patient safety protocols in acute care healthcare facilities.  


Led by healthcare expert and former UC Health executive Patrick Baker, Palarum plans to offer an integrated solution that monitors patient movement through the use of a patented smart textile fabric enhanced with various IoT (Internet of Things) technologies.  Palarum's new solution, named PUP™,  will provide healthcare facilities an enhanced monitoring, notification, and data capture platform designed to improve the care and safety for patients determined to be a potential "fall risk".  
"The research shows that between 700,000 and one million people fall in a healthcare environment every year." says Patrick Baker, President and CEO of Palarum, LLC. "And while most facilities have tried to address the issue with traditional motion detection systems, room sitters and enhanced training, it continues to be a quality of care and cost issue.
"At Palarum, we want to help healthcare staff with their capabilities to anticipate, detect, and more quickly respond when a "fall risk" patient may need assistance. Additionally, our system will gather data that can be used by management to optimize both staff and equipment resources."
About Palarum
Based in Lebanon, Ohio, Palarum, LLC joins the rapidly growing marketplace of new healthcare artificial intelligence start-ups using smart technologies and predictive analytics to improve patient care. While Palarum's current focus is to deliver a solution specifically targeted to the hospital environment, the company plans to expand the use of their patented technologies to other healthcare applications.
This media release shall not and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. The securities offered and sold in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration, or an applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

Palm Products LLC is a growing and dynamic ecommerce retailer. We track, analyze, and use our years of experience to manage, market and retail products for some of nation’s top manufacturers. We are committed to a mutual success between us and our brand partners-suppliers through versatility, adaptability, and most importantly…quality relationships.
 

 
 



Our Strategies



There is no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach…especially when it comes to ecommerce. Every product we take on deserves a different approach, tailored ultimately for the consumer seeking the purchase. With online shopping, there is no need for the old marketing methods of “broadcasting” in hopes to build a top-of-mind name recognition for when then consumer is ultimately making a buying decision. We focus on a “narrowcasting” approach that seeks to serve as an informational resource for consumers shopping for that product. This can be done through a mix of search engine optimization, keyword strategies, and channel distribution.
 

 
 



Our Insights



Our years of experience in online retailing have taught us a couple things. First, too many retailers use price as their sole marketing method, especially online. It becomes a race to the bottom with pricing by trying to gain a market share strictly through being the lowest price. This is the easy way to do it and takes the least amount of work, strategy, and know-how. We believe this will ultimately hurt the brand in both perception to consumer and bottom line of the income statement. Second, we “Narrowcast”. This is probably something you will hear us say a lot. When focusing on reaching consumers, we try and be as specific as possible. For instance, instead of building an advertising campaign focused on a generality like women, ages 25 to 40, we believe in building a more focused approach like women, ages 31 to 35, who live in the Northeast, and watch Grey’s...
 

 
 



Our Future



The future is bright! We are excited for the direction that our company is moving and the partnerships that we have built. The dynamics of today’s marketplace mean that we are constantly searching and refining what our strategies, focuses, and channels will be in the future.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.
