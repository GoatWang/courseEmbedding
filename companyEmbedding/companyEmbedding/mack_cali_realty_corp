CLI: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 03/31/2016 settlement date, and Mack Cali Realty Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 13.11 "days to cover" versus the median component at 6.60. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Short Interest Moves 13.2% Lower For CLI
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 11/14/2014 settlement date, which shows a 552,582 share decrease in total short interest for Mack Cali Realty Corp , to 3,622,750, a decrease of 13.23% since 10/31/2014. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Nov 26, 2014 4:04 PM EST













Interesting CLI Put And Call Options For July 2015
Investors in Mack Cali Realty Corp saw new options begin trading today, for the July 2015 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
