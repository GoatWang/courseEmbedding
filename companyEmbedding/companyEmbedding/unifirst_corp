Uniforms and Work Apparel 
Supplying job-fitted work clothes® to 2 million workers daily. 




In the uniform supply business, there's service… and then there's UniFirst service!

 
We manufacture, supply, and service quality work uniforms
UniFirst has a long and proud tradition of providing quality uniforms, Job-Fitted Work Clothes® and other image and safety enhancing workwear to businesses of all sizes and types. From industrial work shirts and pants, to work jackets and coveralls, to polos and executive wear, to lab coats and food service smocks - UniFirst offers work uniforms for virtually every occupation. Beyond a complete selection of the best work uniforms available, UniFirst also provides accessories like gloves, hats, and protective gear—making “single source workwear solutions” more than just a marketing slogan. 
We manufacture our work apparel in ISO certified facilities to ensure we consistently provide the most important garment features, benefits, and fabrics as defined by our customers. That's why the UniFirst family of workwear brands boasts unrivaled styling, comfort, durability, and protection; as well as wearer-friendly features like roomier cuts, more stitches per inch, and premium construction. And we supplement our own workwear product lines with those of other leading brands. So no matter the needs, UniFirst has the solutions customers demand. 
Rent, lease, or buy work uniforms 
UniFirst customers can assume as little or as much responsibility as they wish for their overall uniform program by electing to rent, lease, or buy. With the proper care and ongoing maintenance, customers can be assured their UniFirst workwear (and facility service) products are always in top shape. 

 Work Uniform Rental includes program administration, laundering, delivery, repairs, replacements, and more. Learn more about our Uniform Rental programs. 
 Work Uniform Leasing includes all the facets of a Uniform Rental Program, but employees take care of laundering their own uniform garments. Learn more about our Uniform Leasing programs. 
 Work Uniform Purchase programs allow you to outfit your staff at competitive prices. And if you require occasional laundering or other garment services, we can provide that too. Learn more about our Uniform Purchase programs. 


Not sure which program is for you? Learn about choosing the right uniform program for your needs or give us a call at (800) 455-7654. 
For more information about UniFirst workwear, call (800) 455-7654.

I interviewed at UniFirst (Memphis, TN) in March 2017.InterviewThe interview process was, as I had read, a bit more cumbersome than one would expect. There was an initial interview with both the sales manager and branch manager together, then a follow-up during which I had to give a presentation on material I was given (to test my "stage presence" and comprehension ability). Following that, there were two phone interviews, one of which was much more in depth (quite enjoyable, actually) before I was done with the process and received an offer. None of the interviews were onerous, few of the questions were redundant, and I was able to get a very good feel for the people for whom I would be working during the process, so I knew it would be a good fit from my perspective; my interviewers knew that I was interviewing them, too, and were very forthcoming in offering information and explaining how thing actually worked in the real world, versus just giving me an idealized picture that was all rosy. I accepted the position because I liked what I heard and now that I am into the rather extensive training, I am eager to start selling.Interview Questions How will I adapt to a sales position that is out of the office   Answer Question UniFirst 2017-04-21 07:30 PDT See All 189 Interviews UniFirst Awards & Accolades+ Add Awards50 Best Companies to Sell For(#6), Selling Power Magazine, 2015Best Companies to Work For(#8), Florida Trend, 2015Florida's Best Companies To Work For(Uniforms), Florida Trend, 2014Executive of the Year (Large Companies) - Gold, Best in Biz Awards, 201450 Best Companies to Sell For(#8), Selling Power Magazine, 2014 201550 Best Companies to Sell For(#6), Selling Power Magazine, 2015Best Companies to Work For(#8), Florida Trend, 2015 2014Florida's Best Companies To Work For(Uniforms), Florida Trend, 2014Executive of the Year (Large Companies) - Gold, Best in Biz Awards, 201450 Best Companies to Sell For(#8), Selling Power Magazine, 2014 2013Top 25 Companies for Career Opportunities, Glassdoor, 201350 Best Companies to Sell For, Selling Power Magazine, 2013 201250 Best Companies to Sell For, Selling Power Magazine, 2012Top 50 Apparel Companies(16), Apparel Magazine, 2012Top 150 Public Companies, Boston Business Journal, 2012 2011Platinum 400: Best Big Companies in America, Forbes Magazine, 2011 2010Sales Department of the Year (Services Category), Stevie Awards, 2010Best Performing Company, Boston Globe, 2010 2009America's Top Companies, Forbes, 2009See MoreSee LessWork at UniFirst?
