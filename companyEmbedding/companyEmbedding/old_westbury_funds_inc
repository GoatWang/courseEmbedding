FUND GOALS, STRATEGIES, RISKS AND PERFORMANCE                                   

================================================================================

The Old Westbury Funds offers five portfolios,  including three equity funds and
two income funds. The following describes the investment goals, strategies,  and
principal risks of each Fund. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve
its goal.                                                                       

Equity Funds                                                                    

Old Westbury Core Equities Fund                                                 

Goal: The Fund's goal is to seek above-average long-term capital appreciation.  

Strategy:  The Fund invests in a diversified  portfolio of large-sized companies
that have potential for above-average  earnings growth. The Fund seeks to invest
primarily in companies which are traded on a recognized  national stock exchange
and which, in the Adviser's  opinion,  will be able to increase their net income
by 15%-20% or more annually  over a five year period.  The Fund will also invest
in  "opportunistic"  companies  that the Adviser  believes have strong  earnings
prospects  for a limited  time  period as a result of an economic or new product
cycle or company  restructuring.  The Fund will invest at least 65% of its total
assets in equity securities of companies with market capitalizations of at least
$4 billion.                                                                     

Old Westbury Growth Opportunity Fund                                            

Goal: The Fund's goal is to seek capital appreciation.                          

Strategy: The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of small- and medium-sized
companies  which,  in the  opinion  of the  Adviser,  have  potential  to become
industry  leaders.  The Fund seeks to invest  primarily in equity  securities of
companies  whose market  capitalizations  are less than $4 billion and which, in
the Adviser's opinion, will be able to increase their rate of growth as a result
of a  catalyst,  such as new  products,  changes in  consumer  preferences,  new
management or changes in the economy.                                           

Old Westbury International Fund                                                 

Goal: The Fund's goal is to seek long-term growth of capital.                   

Strategy:  The Fund  invests in a  diversified  portfolio  of foreign  companies
located  outside  of the U.S.,  at least 85% of which are  listed on  recognized
foreign securities exchanges. The Fund will invest at least 65% of its assets in
equity  securities of companies  representing at least three foreign  countries.
The Fund may  invest  25% or more of its  assets in the  securities  of a single
country.  The Fund may invest up to 50% of its assets in securities of companies
in emerging markets countries. Securities are selected for investment based upon
the  Adviser's   analysis  of  (i)  the  economic  prospects  for  a  particular
geographical  region or country;  (ii) the prospects of a particular  industrial
sector  within the  selected  geographical  area;  and (iii) the  prospects of a
particular company within the selected industrial sector.                       

Income Funds                                                                    

Old Westbury Fixed Income Fund                                                  

Goal: The Fund's goal is to seek total return  (consisting of current income and
capital appreciation).                                                          

Strategy:  The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of investment grade bonds
and notes. The Fund will invest at least 65% of its total assets in fixed income
securities  including  corporate,   asset-backed,   mortgage-backed,   and  U.S.
government  securities.  The  Adviser  attempts  to  manage  the  Fund's  "total
performance"  (which  includes  both  changes in  principal  value of the Fund's
securities and income earned) by lengthening or shortening the average  maturity
of the  Fund's  securities  according  to whether  the  Adviser  expects  market
interest rates to increase or decline.                                          

Old Westbury Municipal Bond Fund                                                

Goal: The Fund's goal is to provide  dividend income that is exempt from federal
regular income tax.                                                             

Strategy:  The Fund  invests in  investment-grade  municipal  securities,  which
includes tax-free debt securities of states,  territories and possessions of the
U.S., and in political subdivisions and taxing authorities of these entities. At
least 80% of the Fund's income from investments in municipal  securities will be
exempt from federal regular income tax.

*A  complete  description  of the  risks  can be  found  in  "Specific  Risks of
Investing in the Funds" herein.                                                 

Loss of  money  is a risk of  investing  in any of the Old  Westbury  Funds.  An
investment  in any of the Old  Westbury  Funds is not a deposit of a bank and is
not insured or guaranteed by the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation or any
other government agency.                                                        

Performance Bar Chart and Total Return-International Fund                       

The bar  chart and table  shown  below  provide  an  indication  of the risks of
investing  in the Old  Westbury  International  Fund by  showing  changes in the
Fund's  performance  from year to year over a four  calendar  year period and by
showing how the Fund's average annual total returns for the since  inception and
one year periods  ended  December 31, 1997,  compare to those of MSCI EAFE Index
and MSCI EMF  Index,  two  broad-based  securities  market  indices.  While past
performance does not necessarily  predict future  performance,  this information
provides you with  historical  performance  information  so that you can analyze
whether the Fund's investment risks are balanced by its potential  rewards.  Bar
charts and  performance  tables for the other four Funds are not provided  since
none of these Funds has been in operation  for a full calendar  year.  The total
return for these Funds from  inception  through  October 31,  1998,  is provided
under the section "Financial Highlights" herein.                                

[GRAPHIC]                                                                       
The graphic  presentations  displayed here consists of a bar charts representing
the returns of institutional shares of the International Fund as of the calendar
year-end  for 1994,  1995,  1996 and 1997.  The `y' axis  reflects  the "% Total
Return"  beginning  with  "-15.00%"  and  increasing  in  increments  of 5 up to
"25.00%". The `x' axis represents calculation periods from the earliest calendar
year end of the  Fund's  start of  business  through  the  calendar  year  ended
December 31, 1997. The light gray shaded chart  features four distinct  vertical
bars,  each shaded in charcoal,  and each  visually  representing  by height the
total return  percentages for the calendar year stated directly at its base. The
calculated total return percentage for the Fund for each calendar year is stated
directly at the top of each  respective bar, for the calendar years 1994 through
1997 are -11.26%,  2.37%,  21.29%, and -1.45%,  respectively.  The total returns
displayed  for the Fund do not  reflect  the  payment of  recurring  shareholder
account  fees.  If these  charges or fees had been  included,  the returns shown
would have been lower.

(2) The adviser  voluntarily waived a portion of the management fee. The adviser
    can terminate  this  voluntary  waiver at any time.  The management fee paid

    Core Equities, Growth Opportunity, Fixed Income, International and Municipal
Bond Funds, respectively, for the year ended October 31, 1998.

    Equities,  Fixed  Income,   International  and  the  Municipal  Bond  Funds,
    respectively, absent the voluntary waiver of a portion of the administrative
    fee and  reimbursement  of certain other operating  expenses by the adviser.
    Other expenses would have been 0.50% for the Growth  Opportunity Fund absent
    the  voluntary  waiver  of a  portion  of  the  administrative  fee  by  the
    administrator  for the year ended October 31, 1998.  The  administrator  can
terminate these voluntary waivers at any time at its sole discretion.

The  following  Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in
each Fund's Shares with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example
assumes  that you invest  $10,000  in each  Fund's  Shares for the time  periods
indicated  and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those  periods.  The
Example  also assumes  that your  investment  has a 5% return each year and that
each Fund's Shares operating  expenses are before waivers and  reimbursements as
estimated above and remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or
lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

PRINCIPAL SECURITIES IN WHICH THE FUNDS INVEST                                  

Equity Securities                                                               
Equity securities  represent a share of an issuer's  earnings and assets,  after
the issuer pays its liabilities. The Equity Funds cannot predict the income they
will receive from equity securities because issuers generally have discretion as
to the payment of any dividends or  distributions.  However,  equity  securities
offer greater  potential for  appreciation  than many other types of securities,
because their value increases directly with the value of the issuer's business. 

Common Stocks                                                         
     Common stocks are the most prevalent type of equity security. Common stocks
     receive the issuer's  earnings  after the issuer pays its creditors and any
     preferred  stockholders.  As a  result,  changes  in an  issuer's  earnings
directly influence the value of its common stock.                     

Fixed Income Securities                                                         
Fixed income securities pay interest,  dividends or distributions at a specified
rate.  The  rate  may  be a  fixed  percentage  of  the  principal  or  adjusted
periodically.  In addition, the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the
principal amount of the security, normally within a specified time. Fixed income
securities  provide more regular  income than equity  securities.  However,  the
returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with
the issuer's  earnings.  This limits the potential  appreciation of fixed income
securities as compared to equity securities.                                    

A  security's  yield  measures  the  annual  income  earned on a  security  as a
percentage of its price. A security's yield will increase or decrease  depending
upon whether it costs less (a discount) or more (a premium)  than the  principal
amount. If the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity, the
price and yield on a discount  or  premium  security  may change  based upon the
probability of an early redemption.  Securities with higher risks generally have
higher yields.                                                                  

Tax Exempt Securities                                                           
Tax exempt  securities are fixed income securities that pay interest that is not
subject to regular federal income taxes. Typically, states, counties, cities and
other political  subdivisions and authorities issue tax exempt  securities.  The
market categorizes tax exempt securities by their source of repayment.          

Municipal Notes                                                       
     Municipal notes are short-term tax exempt securities.  Many  municipalities
     issue such notes to fund their current  operations  before collecting taxes
     or other municipal  revenues.  Municipalities  may also issue notes to fund
     capital projects prior to issuing  long-term  bonds. The issuers  typically
     repay the notes at the end of their fiscal year,  either with taxes,  other
revenues or proceeds from newly issued notes or bonds.

Foreign Securities                                                              
Foreign  securities  are  securities of issuers based outside the United States.
The  Funds  consider  an  issuer  to be based  outside  the  United  States  if:
o........it  is organized  under the laws of, or has a principal  office located
in, another country; o........the principal trading market for its securities is
in another  country;  or o........it (or its  subsidiaries)  derived in its most
current fiscal year at least 50% of its total assets, capitalization, gross     
     revenue or profit from goods produced, services performed, or sales made in
another country.                                                                

Foreign securities are primarily  denominated in foreign currencies.  Along with
the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type, foreign
securities are subject currency risks and risks of foreign investing.           

SPECIFIC RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE OLD WESTBURY FUNDS                           

Equity  Securities  Risks.  The EQUITY FUNDS are subject to  fluctuations in the
stock markets,  which have periods of increasing and decreasing  values.  Stocks
have greater volatility than debt securities. While greater volatility increases
risks, it offers the potential for greater reward.                              

Equity risk is also related to the size of the company issuing stock.  Companies
may be categorized as having a small,  medium, or large  capitalization  (market
value).  The  potential  risks are higher with small- and  medium-capitalization
companies and lower with large-capitalization  companies.  Therefore, you should
expect that  investments  in the GROWTH  OPPORTUNITY  FUND will be more volatile
than broad  stock  market  indices  such as the S&P 500 or funds that  invest in
large-capitalization companies such as the CORE EQUITIES FUND.                  

Foreign  Securities  Risks.   Foreign  securities  pose  additional  risks  over
U.S.-based  securities for a number of reasons.  Because the INTERNATIONAL  FUND
invests  primarily in foreign  securities,  and the GROWTH  OPPORTUNITY FUND can
invest in  Canadian  Securities,  you  should  expect  that  these  factors  may
adversely  affect the value of an investment in these Funds.  Foreign  economic,
governmental, and political systems may be less favorable than those of the U.S.
Foreign   governments  may  exercise   greater  control  over  their  economies,
industries,  and  citizen's  rights.  Specific  risk factors  related to foreign
securities  include:  inflation,  structure and regulation of financial markets,
liquidity and volatility of investments,  taxation  policies,  currency exchange
rates and regulations,  and accounting  standards.  The  INTERNATIONAL  FUND and
GROWTH  OPPORTUNITY FUND may incur higher costs and expenses when making foreign
investments, which will affect the Funds' total return.                         

Foreign  securities  may be denominated in foreign  currencies.  Therefore,  the
value of a Fund's  assets and income in U.S.  dollars may be affected by changes
in exchange rates and regulations,  since exchange rates for foreign  currencies
change  daily.  The  combination  of currency risk and market risk tends to make
securities  traded in foreign  markets  more  volatile  than  securities  traded
exclusively in the U.S. Although the INTERNATIONAL  FUND and GROWTH  OPPORTUNITY
FUND value their assets daily in U.S. dollars, they will not convert its holding
of foreign currencies to U.S. dollars daily. Therefore, the Funds may be exposed
to currency risks over an extended period of time.                              

Emerging Market Securities Risks. INTERNATIONAL FUND may invest up to 50% of its
assets in developing or emerging market securities. Investments in developing or
emerging  market  securities are subject to higher risks than those in developed
market  countries  because  there is  greater  uncertainty  in less  established
markets  and  economies.  These  risks  include  political,  social or  economic
systems, smaller securities markets, lower trading volume, and substantial rates
of inflation.                                                                   

Fixed Income Securities Risks. Risks of fixed income securities will affect the 
INCOME FUNDS.                                                                 

Prices of fixed-rate debt securities generally move in the opposite direction of
interest  rates.  The interest  payments on  fixed-rate  debt  securities do not
change  when  interest  rates  change.  Therefore,  since  the  price  of  these
securities  can be expected to decrease when interest  rates  increase,  you can
expect that the value of investments in a Fund may go down. Although the Adviser
attempts to anticipate  interest rate  movements,  there is no guarantee that it
will be able to do so.                                                          

In  addition,   longer-term  debt  securities  will  experience   greater  price
volatility than debt securities with shorter maturities.  You can expect the net
asset values of a Fund to fluctuate accordingly.                                

The credit quality of a debt security is based upon the issuers ability to repay
the  security.  If payments on a debt  security are not paid when due,  that may
cause the net asset value of a Fund holding the security to go down.            

Fixed  income  securities  may also be subject to call risk.  If interest  rates
decline, an issuer may repay (or "call") a debt security held by a Fund prior to
its maturity.  If this occurs,  the Adviser may have to reinvest the proceeds in
debt securities paying lower interest rates. If this happens,  a Fund may have a
lower yield.                                                                    

In  addition,  FIXED INCOME FUND may invest in "inverse  floaters,"  which are a
form of  "derivative"  debt security,  and whose price may be subject to extreme
fluctuation in the event of interest rate movements.                            

Municipal  Securities  Risks.  An investment in the MUNICIPAL  BOND FUND will be
affected by municipal securities risks. Local political and economic factors may
adversely affect the value and liquidity of municipal securities held by a Fund.
The value of municipal securities also may be affected more by supply and demand
factors or the  creditworthiness  of the issuer than by market  interest  rates.
Repayment  of  municipal  securities  depends  on the  ability  of the issuer or
project backing such  securities to generate taxes or revenues.  There is a risk
that the interest on an otherwise  tax-exempt  municipal security may be subject
to federal income tax.                                                          

Asset-Backed/Mortgage-Backed Securities Risks. An investment in the FIXED INCOME
FUND will be subject to asset-backed and mortgage-backed  securities risks which
includes  prepayment  when interest rates fall because many borrowers  refinance
mortgages  to  take   advantage  of  more   favorable   rates.   Prepayments  on
mortgage-backed  securities  are also  affected  by other  factors,  such as the
volume of home  sales.  A Fund's  yield  will be  reduced  if cash from  prepaid
securities is reinvested in securities  with lower interest  rates.  The risk of
prepayment may also decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities.           

Asset-backed  securities  may have a higher level of default and  recovery  risk
than mortgage-backed securities.  However, both of these types of securities may
decline in value because of mortgage  foreclosures or defaults on the underlying
obligations.                                                                    

Futures and Options  Risks.  GROWTH  OPPORTUNITY  FUND,  CORE EQUITIES FUND, and
FIXED  INCOME  FUND may use  financial  and  stock  index  futures  and  options
primarily  to  protect  against  adverse  changes  to  the  value  of  portfolio
securities  due to anticipated  changes in interest rates or market  conditions.
Similarly,  INTERNATIONAL  FUND may use foreign  currency futures and options to
protect  against  adverse  changes to the value of portfolio  securities  due to
anticipated  changes in foreign  currency rates.  The successful use of futures,
options and other  derivative  instruments is based on the Adviser's  ability to
correctly  anticipate  market  movements.  When the direction of the prices of a
Fund's  securities  does not  correlate  with the  changes in the value of these
transactions,  or when the trading market for derivatives  becomes  illiquid,  a
Fund could lose money.                                                          

Risks Related to Company Size. Generally,  the smaller the market capitalization
of a company,  the fewer the number of hsares traded daily, the less liquied its
stock and the more volatile its price.  Market  capitalization  is determined by
multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current market price per
share.                                                                          

Companies with smaller market  capitalizations  also tend to have unproven track
records, a limited product or service base and limited access to capital.  These
factors also increase  risks and make these  companies  more likely to fail than
larger, well capitalized companies.                                             

Securities Lending Risks. When a Fund lends its portfolio securities, it may not
be able to get them back from the  borrower on a timely  basis.  If this occurs,
the Fund may lose certain investment  opportunities.  The Funds are also subject
to the  risks  associated  with  the  investment  of  cash  collateral,  usually
fixed-income securities risk.                                                   

Temporary  Defensive  Investments.  To minimize  potential  losses and  maintain
liquidity  necessary  to meet  shareholder  redemptions  during  adverse  market
conditions,  each of the Old  Westbury  Funds may  temporarily  depart  from its
principal  investment strategy by investing up to 100% of Fund assets in cash or
short-term,  high  quality  money market  instruments  (e.g.  commercial  paper,
repurchase agreements, etc.). This may cause a Fund to temporarily forgo greater
investment returns for the safety of principal.                                 

Investment  Ratings.  Some securities in which the Funds invest will be rated in
the lowest investment grade category (e.g. BBB or Baa).  Securities rated BBB by
Standard and Poor's or Baa by Moody's Investors Services,  Inc. have speculative
characteristics.  Unrated  securities will be determined by the Adviser to be of
like  quality and may have greater risk (but a  potentially  higher  yield) than
comparable  rated  securities.  If a security is  downgraded,  the Adviser  will
re-evaluate  the  security  and  determine  whether  or not the  security  is an
acceptable investment.                                                          

Portfolio Turnover. The Funds do not intend to invest for the purpose of seeking
short-term profits. Securities will be sold without regard to the length of time
they have been held when the Funds' Adviser  believes it is appropriate to do so
in light of a Fund's investment goal. A higher portfolio  turnover rate involves
greater  transaction  expenses which must be borne directly by a Fund (and thus,
indirectly by its  shareholders),  and affect Fund performance.  In addition,  a
high rate of portfolio  turnover may result in the realization of larger amounts
of capital  gains  which,  when  distributed  to that Fund's  shareholders,  are
taxable to them.                                                                

Year 2000  Readiness.  The "Year 2000"  problem is the  potential  for  computer
errors or failures  because certain  computer systems may be unable to interpret
dates after  December  31,  1999.  The Year 2000  problem  may cause  systems to
process  information  incorrectly  and  could  disrupt  businesses  that rely on
computers, like the Funds.                                                      

While it is  impossible  to  determine in advance all of the risks to the Funds,
the Funds could  experience  interruptions  in basic  financial and  operational
functions.  Fund  shareholders  could  experience  errors or disruptions in Fund
share  transactions  or Fund  communications.  The Funds' service  providers are
making  changes  to their  computer  systems  to  attempt  to fix any Year  2000
problems.  In addition,  they are working to gather information from third-party
providers to determine their Year 2000 readiness.                               

Year 2000 problems would also increase the risks of the Funds'  investments.  To
assess the potential effect of the Year 2000 problem,  the investment adviser is
reviewing information regarding the Year 2000 readiness of issuers of securities
the Fund may purchase.  However, this may be difficult with certain issuers. For
example,  funds dealing with foreign  service  providers or investing in foreign
securities  will have  difficulty  determining  the Year 2000 readiness of those
entities. This is especially true of entities or issuers in emerging markets.   

The  financial  impact of these issues for the Funds is still being  determined.
There can be no assurance  that  potential  Year 2000 problems  would not have a
material adverse effect on the Funds.                                           

HOW TO BUY SHARES                                                               
What Do Shares Cost?                                                            

You can buy shares of a Fund at net asset value (NAV),  without a sales  charge,
on any day the New York  Stock  Exchange  (NYSE)  is open for  business.  NAV is
determined at the end of regular  trading  (normally 4 p.m.,  Eastern time) each
day the NYSE is open.  Your  purchase  order must be  received in proper form by
4:00 p.m. (Eastern time) in order to receive that day's NAV.                    

Each Fund's NAV is computed by dividing the value of the  Portfolio's net assets
(i.e.,  the  value  of  a  portfolios  securities  and  other  assets  less  its
liabilities,  including  expenses payable or accred but excluding  capital stock
and surplus) by the total number of shares outstanding. Portfolio securities for
which market  quotations are readily  available are valued at market value.  All
other investment assets of the Portfolios are valued in such manner as the Board
of Directors in good faith deems appropriate to reflect their fair value.  Since
the  International  Fund has portfolio  securities that are primarily  listed on
foreign  exchanges  that may trade on  weekends or other days when the Fund does
not price its shares, the NAV for the International Fund may change on days when
shareholders will not be able to purchase or redeem the Fund's shares.          

To open an account with one of the Funds, your first investment must be at least
$1,000.  However,  you can add to your account for as little as $100. In special
circumstances, these minimums may be waived or lowered at the Funds' discretion.

How Do I Purchase Shares?                                                       
Shares  of each  Portfolio  may be  purchased  by mail  or by wire  through  the
Distributor (Edgewood Services Inc.) or through a Shareholder Servicing Agent or
Broker-Dealer (Authorized Dealer) that has an agreement with the Distributor.   

If you  purchase  shares  directly  from the  Distributor,  your account will be
maintained by the transfer agent of the Funds, Fundamental Shareholder Services,
Inc.  (FSSI  or  the  Transfer  Agent).  For  account  balance  information  and
shareholder services, you may call FSSI at (800) 607-2200.                      

By Mail

Subsequent  investments  in a Fund do not  require a Purchase  Application;  the
shareholder's  account number,  however,  must be clearly marked on the check to
ensure proper credit.                                                           

Subsequent  investments  may also be made by sending a check with the detachable

Investments  may be made directly  through the use of wire  transfers of federal
funds.  Shares  purchased by wire will be effected at the public  offering price

shares directly from the Distributor by federal funds wire.                     

Investors making initial investments by wire must promptly complete the Purchase
Application  accompanying  this Prospectus and forward it to the Funds' Transfer
Agent. No Purchase  Application is required for subsequent  purchases.  Complete

How do I Redeem Shares?                                                         
Shares of each Fund may be  redeemed  by mail or by wire  through an  Authorized
Dealer or through the Funds' Transfer Agent.                                    

Redemptions  will only be made on days when a Fund  computes its NAV.  When your
redemption  request  is  received  in  proper  form  shares  of the Fund will be
redeemed at its next determined NAV.                                            

Redemption  requests must be received by 4:00 p.m.  (Eastern  time) in order for
shares to be redeemed at that day's NAV.  Redemption  proceeds  will normally be
mailed the following  business day, but in no event more than seven days,  after
the request is made.                                                            

By Telephone

Through the Transfer Agent                                                      

For  shareholders  whose accounts are maintained by the Transfer  Agent,  if you
have authorized the telephone redemption privilege in your Purchase Application,
you may redeem shares by calling the Transfer Agent at (800) 607-2200.          

By Mail                                                                         
Through your Authorized Dealer                                                  
Send a letter to your  Authorized  Dealer,  indicating your name, the Fund name,
your  account  number,  and the  number of shares or dollar  amount  you want to
redeem.  Your  request  must be signed in  exactly  the same way the  account is
registered (if there is more than one owner of the shares, all must sign).      

Shareholders  may also redeem Fund shares  through  participating  organizations
holding such shares who have made arrangements with the Funds permitting them to
redeem such shares by telephone or facsimile  transmission  and who may charge a
fee for this service.

Additional Conditions                                                           
Signature Guarantees                                                            
You must have a signature guarantee on written redemption requests:             

o   when you are requesting a redemption of $50,000 or more;          
     o when you want a  redemption  to be sent to an address  other than the one
     you have on record with the Fund; or o when you want the redemption payable
to someone other than the shareholder of record.                      

Your signature can be guaranteed by any federally insured financial  institution
(such as a bank or credit  union) or a  broker-dealer  that is a domestic  stock
exchange member, but not by a notary public.                                    

Limitations on Redemption Proceeds                                              
Redemption  proceeds normally are mailed within one business day after receiving
a request in proper form. However, payment may be delayed up to seven days:     

o   to allow your purchase payment to clear;                          
o   during periods of market volatility; or                           
     o when a shareholder's  trade activity or amount adversely impacts a Fund's
ability to manage its assets.                                                   

How Do I Exchange Shares?                                                       

You may  exchange  shares of a Fund for shares of any of the other Funds free of
charge, provided you meet the $1,000 minimum investment requirement. An exchange
is treated as a redemption and subsequent  purchase,  and is therefore a taxable
transaction.  Signatures  must be  guaranteed  if you request and exchange  into
another Fund with a different shareholder  registration.  The Funds will provide
shareholders  with 60 days'  written  notice prior to any  modification  of this
exchange privilege.                                                             

ACCOUNT AND SHARE INFORMATION                                                   

Confirmations and Account Statements                                            
You will receive  confirmation  of  purchases,  redemptions  and  exchanges.  In
addition,  you will receive periodic statements  reporting all account activity,
including dividends and capital gains paid.                                     

Dividends and Capital Gains                                                     

Dividends (if any) are paid to shareholders  invested in the Funds on the record
date.  In  addition,  each Fund  intends  to pay  dividends  and  capital  gains
distributions,  if any, on a quarterly  basis.  Your dividends and capital gains
distributions  will be automatically  reinvested in additional shares unless you
elect cash payments.                                                            

If you  purchase  shares just before a Fund  declares a dividend or capital gain
distribution,  you will pay the full  price for the  shares  and then  receive a
portion  of the price  back in the form of a  distribution,  whether  or not you
reinvest the  distribution  in shares.  Therefore,  you should  consider the tax
implications of purchasing shares shortly before the Fund declares a dividend or
capital gain.                                                                   

Tax Information                                                                 
The Funds send you an annual statement of your account activity to assist you in
completing  your federal,  state and local tax returns.  Fund  distributions  of
dividends  and  capital  gains  are  taxable  to you  whether  paid  in  cash or
reinvested in a Fund. Capital gains distributions are taxable at different rates
depending upon the length of time a Fund holds its assets.                      

Fund  distributions  for the Core Equities  Fund,  Growth  Opportunity  Fund and
International   Fund  are  expected  to  be  primarily   capital   gains.   Fund
distributions  for the Fixed Income Fund and the Municipal  Fund are expected to
be primarily dividends. Redemptions and exchanges are taxable sales.            

Please  consult your tax adviser  regarding your federal,  state,  and local tax
liability.                                                                      

Municipal Income Fund                                                           

The Fund sends you a timely  statement of your account activity to assist you in
completing  your federal,  state and local tax returns.  It is anticipated  that
Fund  distributions  will be  primarily  dividends  that are exempt from federal
income  tax,  although  a portion  of the  Fund's  dividends  may not be exempt.
Whether or not dividends are exempt from federal income tax, they may be subject
to state and local taxes.  You may have to include certain  dividends as taxable
income if the federal  alternative minimum tax applies to you. Capital gains and
non-exempt dividends are taxable whether paid in cash or reinvested in the Fund.
Redemptions  and exchanges are taxable  sales.  Please  consult your tax adviser
regarding your federal, state and local tax liability.                          

WHO MANAGES THE FUNDS?

Finance.                                                                        

DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES                                                     

Edgewood  Services,  Inc., a subsidiary  of Federated  Investors,  Inc.,  is the
principal  distributor for shares of the Funds and a number of other  investment
companies. In addition, the Adviser acts as a shareholder servicing agent to the
Funds.                                                                          

Rule 12b-1 Plan.  The Funds have  adopted a Rule 12b-1 Plan which allows them to
pay marketing and shareholder  servicing fees to the  Distributor,  the Adviser,
and financial  intermediaries for the sale,  distribution and customer servicing
of the Funds'  shares.  Because  these shares pay  marketing  fees on an ongoing
basis,  your  investment cost may be higher over time than shares with different
sales charges and marketing fees.                                               

FINANCIAL INFORMATION                                                           

Financial Highlights                                                            
The following  financial  highlights  are intended to help you  understand  each
Fund's financial performance for its past five fiscal years, or since inception,
if the life of a Fund is shorter.  Some of the information is presented on a per
share basis.  Total returns represent the rate an investor would have earned (or
lost) on an investment  in a Fund,  assuming  reinvestment  of all dividends and
distributions.                                                                  

This information has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, whose report,  along
with the Funds' audited financial  statements,  is included in the Annual Report
which is available upon request.

SECURITIES DESCRIPTIONS, TECHNIQUES AND RISKS                                   

The following  descriptions,  techniques and risks used by the Funds in addition
to those described in the prospectus.                                           

Asset Backed Securities.  Asset-Backed Securities are issued by non-governmental
entities  and carry no direct or  indirect  government  guarantee.  Asset-Backed
Securities  represent  an  interest  in a pool of  assets  such as car loans and
credit card  receivables.  These  securities may be in the form of  pass-through
instruments or asset-backed bonds.                                              

Payments on  asset-backed  securities  depend upon assets held by the issuer and
collections of the underlying  loans. The value of these  securities  depends on
many factors, including changing interest rates, the availability of information
about the pool and its structure,  the credit quality of the underlying  assets,
the market's  perception of the servicer of the pool, and any credit enhancement
provided. Also, these securities may be subject to prepayment risk.             

Bank Obligations.  Bank Obligations include negotiable  certificates of deposit,
time deposits and bankers acceptances. The Funds will invest in bank instruments
(i) that have been issued by banks and savings and loans and savings  banks that
have more than $2 billion in total  assets and are  organized  under the laws of
the United  States or any state;  (ii) of foreign  branches of these banks or of
foreign banks of equivalent size; and (iii) of U.S. branches of foreign Banks of
equivalent size. The Funds will not invest in obligations for which the Adviser,
or any of its affiliated persons, is the ultimate obligor or accepting bank. The
Funds may also  invest in  obligations  of the  European  Investment  Bank,  the
Inter-American  Development  Bank or the  World  Bank  and  other  such  similar
institutions.                                                                   

Borrowing.  The Funds may borrow money from banks or through reverse  repurchase
agreements  in amounts up to one-third of total assets and pledge some assets as
collateral.  A Fund that  borrows  will pay  interest on borrowed  money and may
incur other transaction  costs.  These expenses could exceed the income received
or capital appreciation  realized by the Fund from any securities purchased with
borrowed money.  With respect to borrowings,  the Funds are required to maintain
continuous  asset  coverage  to 300% of the  amount  borrowed.  If the  coverage
declines to less than 300%, the Fund must sell sufficient  portfolio  securities
to restore the coverage even if it must sell the securities at a loss.          

Commercial  Paper.  The Funds may invest in commercial  paper,  including master
demand obligations. Master demand obligations are obligations that provide for a
periodic  adjustment  in the interest  rate paid and permit daily changes in the
amount  borrowed.  The  commercial  paper in which the Funds may invest  must be
rated A-1 or A-2 by  Standard  & Poor's  (S&P),  Prime-1  or  Prime-2 by Moody's
Investors Service,  Inc.  (Moody's),  or F-1 or F-2 by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch).
Master  demand  obligations  are governed by  agreements  between the issuer and
Bessemer Trust Company,  N.A.,  acting as agent,  for no additional  fee, in its
capacity as  investment  adviser to the Funds and as fiduciary for other clients
for whom it exercises investment  discretion.  The monies loaned to the borrower
come from  accounts  managed  by the  Adviser  or its  affiliates,  pursuant  to
arrangements with such accounts. Interest and principal payments are credited to
such accounts. The Adviser,  acting as a fiduciary on behalf of its clients, has
the right to increase or decrease the amount  provided to the borrower  under an
obligation. The borrower has the right to pay without penalty all or any part of
the principal amount then outstanding on an obligation together with interest to
the date of payment. Since these obligations typically provide that the interest
rate is tied to the Federal Reserve commercial paper composite rate, the rate on
master  demand  obligations  is subject to change.  Repayment of a master demand
obligation to  participating  accounts depends on the ability of the borrower to
pay the accrued  interest  and  principal of the  obligation  on demand which is
continuously monitored by the Adviser. Since master demand obligations typically
are not rated by credit  rating  agencies,  the Funds may invest in such unrated
obligations only if at the time of an investment the obligation is determined by
the  Adviser  to have a  credit  quality  which  satisfies  the  Funds'  quality
restrictions.   Although  there  is  no  secondary   market  for  master  demand
obligations,  such  obligations are considered by the Funds to be liquid because
they are payable  upon  demand.  The Funds do not have any  specific  percentage
limitation on investments in master demand obligations.                         

Common  Stocks  are  the  most  prevalent  type  of  equity   security.   Common
stockholders  receive the  residual  value of the  issuer's  earnings and assets
after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred stockholders. As a result,
changes  in an  issuer's  earnings  directly  influence  the value of its common
stock.                                                                          

Convertible  Securities.  Certain  Funds  may,  as  an  interim  alternative  to
investment  in  common  stocks,   purchase  investment  grade  convertible  debt
securities  having a rating of, or equivalent to, at least "BBB" by S&P or "Baa"
by Moody's,  or if unrated,  judged by the Adviser to be of comparable  quality.
Securities  rated BBB or Baa have  speculative  characteristics.  Although lower
rated bonds generally have higher yields,  they are more speculative and subject
to a greater  risk of default  with  respect  to the  issuer's  capacity  to pay
interest and repay principal than are higher rated debt securities.             

In selecting  convertible  securities,  the Adviser relies  primarily on its own
evaluation  of the issuer and the  potential  for capital  appreciation  through
conversion.  It does not rely on the rating of the security or sell because of a
change in the  rating  absent a change in its own  evaluation  of the  underling
common  stock and the  ability of the issuer to pay  principal  and  interest or
dividends when due without  disrupting its business goals.  Interest or dividend
yield is a factor only to the extent it is reasonably consistent with prevailing
rates for securities of similar quality and thereby provides a support level for
the market  price of the  security.  The Funds  will  purchase  the  convertible
securities  of highly  leveraged  issuers  only  when,  in the  judgment  of the
Adviser,  the  risk of  default  is  outweighed  by the  potential  for  capital
appreciation.  The Funds do not intend to  purchase  convertible  securities  in
excess of 5% of the Fund's total assets.                                        

Corporate Reorganizations. Each Fund may invest in securities for which a tender
or exchange  offer has been made or announced and in securities of companies for
which a merger,  consolidation,  liquidation or reorganization proposal has been
announced if, in the judgment of the Adviser,  there is  reasonable  prospect of
capital  appreciation   significantly  greater  than  the  brokerage  and  other
transaction  expenses involved.  The primary risk of such investments is that if
the contemplated  transaction is abandoned,  revised, delayed or becomes subject
to unanticipated  uncertainties,  the market price of the securities may decline
below the purchase price paid by the Funds.                                     

In general,  securities  which are the subject of such an offer or proposal sell
at  a  premium  to  their  historic  market  price   immediately  prior  to  the
announcement of the offer or proposal.  However,  the increased  market price of
such  securities  may also  discount  what the stated or appraised  value of the
security would be if the contemplated  transaction were approved or consummated.
Such investments may be advantageous when the discount significantly  overstates
the  risk  of  the  contingencies   involved;   significantly   undervalues  the
securities,  assets or cash to be received by  shareholders  of the  prospective
portfolio  company  as a  result  of  the  contemplated  transaction;  or  fails
adequately  to  recognize  the  possibility  that the offer or  proposal  may be
replaced or superseded by an offer or proposal of greater value.  The evaluation
of such  contingencies  requires unusually broad knowledge and experience on the
part of the Adviser which must appraise not only the value of the issuer and its
component  businesses  as well as the assets or  securities  to be received as a
result of the  contemplated  transaction,  but also the financial  resources and
business  motivation  of the  offerer as well as the  dynamics  of the  business
climate when the offer or proposal is in process.                               

In  making   such   investments,   each  Fund  will  not   violate  any  of  its
diversification  requirements or investment restrictions (see below, "Investment
Restrictions")  including the requirement that, with respect to 75% of its total
assets,  not more than 5% of its total assets may be invested in the  securities
of any one issuer.  Since such  investments are ordinarily short term in nature,
they will  increase  the  turnover  ratio of the Funds  thereby  increasing  its
brokerage  and  other  transaction  expenses.  The  Adviser  intends  to  select
investments of the type described which, in its view, have a reasonable prospect
of  capital  appreciation  which is  significant  in  relation  to both the risk
involved and the potential of available alternate investments as well as monitor
the effect of such investments on the tax qualification  tests of the Code. Each
Fund does not intend to purchase these securities in excess of 5% of that Fund's
total assets.                                                                   

Credit  Quality.  The fixed  income  securities  in which a Fund invests will be
rated at least investment grade by a nationally  recognized  statistical ratings
organization  (NRSRO).  Investment  grade  securities  have  received  one of an
NRSRO's four highest  ratings.  Securities  receiving the fourth  highest rating
(Baa by Moody's or BBB by S&P or Fitch)  have  speculative  characteristics  and
changes in the market or the  economy  are more  likely to affect the ability of
the  issuer to repay  its  obligations  when  due.  The  Adviser  will  evaluate
downgraded  securities  and  will  sell  any  security  determined  not to be an
acceptable   investment.   International   Fund,  Core  Equities  Fund,   Growth
Opportunity  Fund and the  Fixed  Income  Fund may  invest up to 5% of their net
assets in  securities  rated  below  investment  grade,  but not below the sixth
highest rating  category.  The Growth  Opportunity  Fund, Core Equities Fund and
Municipal Bond Fund will not invest in securities rated below investment  grade.
(See "High Yield Securities")                                                   

Debt  Obligations.  The Funds may invest in debt  obligations,  including bonds,
notes, and debentures of corporate issuers or governments,  which may have fixed
or floating rates of interest.                                                  

       Fixed  Rate Debt  Obligations.  The Funds may  invest in fixed  rate debt
       obligations,   including  fixed  rate  debt  securities  with  short-term
       characteristics.  Fixed rate securities  with short-term  characteristics
       are long-term  debt  obligations  but are treated in the market as having
       short  maturities  because call features of the  securities may make them
       callable  within a short  period  of time.  A fixed  rate  security  with
       short-term  characteristics  would include a fixed income security priced
       close to call or redemption price or a fixed income security  approaching
maturity, where the expectation of call or redemption is high.    

       Fixed rate  securities  exhibit  more price  volatility  during  times of
       rising or falling  interest rates than  securities with floating rates of
       interest.  This is because floating rate securities,  as described below,
       behave like short-term  instruments in that the rate of interest they pay
       is subject to periodic  adjustments  based on a designated  interest rate
       index.  Fixed rate  securities  pay a fixed rate of interest and are more
       sensitive to fluctuating  interest  rates.  In periods of rising interest
       rates the value of a fixed rate  security  is likely to fall.  Fixed rate
       securities  with short-term  characteristics  are not subject to the same
       price volatility as fixed rate securities  without such  characteristics.
       Therefore, they behave more like floating rate securities with respect to
price volatility.                                                 

       Floating  Rate Debt  Obligations.  The Funds may invest in floating  rate
       debt  obligations  including  increasing rate  securities.  Floating rate
       securities are generally  offered at an initial interest rate which is at
       or  above  prevailing  market  rates.  The  interest  rate  paid on these
       securities  is then  reset  periodically  (commonly  every  90 days to an
       increment over some predetermined interest rate index). Commonly utilized
       indices include the three-month  Treasury bill rate, the 180-day Treasury
       bill rate, the one-month or  three-month  London  Interbank  Offered Rate
       (LIBOR),  the prime rate of a bank,  the commercial  paper rates,  or the
       longer-term   rates  on  U.S.   Treasury   securities.   Increasing  rate
       securities'  rates  are  reset  periodically  at  different  levels  on a
       predetermined  scale.  These  levels of interest  are  ordinarily  set at
       progressively   higher   increments   over  time.  Some  increasing  rate
       securities  may,  by  agreement,  revert to a fixed  rate  status.  These
       securities may also contain features which allow the issuer the option to
       convert the increasing rate of interest to a fixed rate under such terms,
       conditions, and limitations as are described in each issuer's prospectus.

Derivative Contracts and Securities.  The term derivative has traditionally been
applied to certain contracts (futures,  forward, option and swap contracts) that
derive  their  value  from  changes  in the  value  of an  underlying  security,
currency,  commodity  or  index.  Derivatives  also  refer  to  securities  that
incorporate  the performance  characteristics  of these contracts and securities
derived  from the cash  flows from  underlying  securities,  mortgages  or other
obligations.  While the response of certain  derivatives  to market  changes may
differ  from  traditional  investments  like  stocks  and  bonds,  they  do  not
necessarily   present  greater  market  risks  than   traditional   investments.
Derivative  contracts  and  securities  can be used to  reduce or  increase  the
volatility of an investment portfolio's total performance.                      

Depositary Receipts. American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are receipts, issued by
a  U.S.  bank,   that  represent  an  interest  in  shares  of  a  foreign-based
corporation.  ADRs provide a way to buy shares of foreign-based companies in the
U.S. rather than in overseas markets.  European  Depositary  Receipts (EDRs) and
Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) are receipts, issued by foreign banks or trust
companies,  or foreign  branches of U.S.  banks,  that  represent an interest in
shares of either a foreign or U.S.  corporation.  Depositary Receipts may not be
denominated  in the same currency as the underlying  securities  into which they
may be converted, and are subject to currency risks. Depositary Receipts involve
many of the same risks of investing directly in foreign securities.             

Emerging  Growth  Companies.  Emerging  Growth  Companies are companies that are
beyond  their  initial  start-up  periods  but have not yet  reached  a state of
established  growth or  maturity.  The nature of  investing  in emerging  growth
companies  involves  a  greater  level of risk  than  would be  associated  when
investing in more  established  seasoned  companies.  The rate of growth of such
companies may at times be dramatic; such companies often provide new products or
services that enable them to capture a dominant or important market position, or
have a special area of  expertise,  or are able to take  advantage of changes in
demographic  factors  in a more  profitable  way  than  other  companies.  These
companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may
lack  management  depth  since  they  have  not  been  tested  by  time  or  the
marketplace.  The  securities of emerging  growth  companies  often have limited
marketability  and  may be  subject  to  more  volatile  market  movements  than
securities of larger,  more established  growth companies or the market averages
in general. Shares of the Growth Opportunity Fund, therefore,  may be subject to
greater  fluctuation  in value than funds  investing  entirely in proven  growth
stocks.                                                                         

Foreign Currency Transactions.  Foreign currency transactions are generally used
to obtain foreign currencies to settle securities transactions. They can also be
used as a hedge to protect assets against  adverse  changes in foreign  currency
exchange rates or regulations.  When the Fund uses foreign currency exchanges as
a hedge,  it may also limit potential gain that could result from an increase in
the value of such  currencies.  The Fund may be  affected  either  favorably  or
unfavorably  by  fluctuations  in the  relative  rates of  exchange  between the
currencies of different nations.                                                

         Foreign  Currency  Hedging   Transactions.   Foreign  currency  hedging
         transactions are used to protect against foreign currency exchange rate
         risks.  These transactions  include:  forward foreign currency exchange
         contracts,  foreign currency futures  contracts,  and purchasing put or
call options on foreign currencies.                           

         Forward Foreign Currency  Exchange  Contracts  (Forward  Contracts) are
         used to minimize the risks  associated with changes in the relationship
         between the U.S. dollar and foreign  currencies.  They are used to lock
         in the U.S. dollar price of a foreign security. A Forward Contract is a
         commitment to purchase or sell a specific  currency for an agreed price
at a future date.                                             

         If the Adviser  believes a foreign  currency  will decline  against the
         U.S.  dollar,  a Forward  Contract may be used to sell an amount of the
         foreign currency  approximating  the value of a Fund's security that is
         denominated  in the  foreign  currency.  The  success  of this  hedging
         strategy is highly  uncertain due to the difficulties of predicting the
         values of foreign  currencies,  of precisely  matching Forward Contract
         amounts, and because of the constantly changing value of the securities
         involved.  The Fund will not enter into Forward  Contracts  for hedging
         purposes in a particular  currency in an amount in excess of the Fund's
         assets  denominated  in  that  currency.  Conversely,  if  the  Adviser
         believes that the U.S. dollar will decline against a foreign  currency,
         a Forward Contract may be used to buy that foreign currency for a fixed
dollar amount, otherwise known as cross-hedging.              

         In these  transactions,  the Fund will  segregate  assets with a market
         value equal to the amount of the foreign currency purchased. Therefore,
         the Fund will always have cash,  cash  equivalents or high quality debt
         securities  available  to  cover  Forward  Contracts  or to  limit  any
potential risk. The segregated assets will be priced daily.   

         Forward  Contracts may limit  potential gain from a positive  change in
         the  relationship  between  the U.S.  dollar  and  foreign  currencies.
         Unanticipated  changes in currency  prices may result in poorer overall
      performance for a Fund than if it had not engaged in such contracts.

         Purchasing  and Writing Put and Call Options on foreign  currencies are
         used to  protect  the Fund's  portfolio  against  declines  in the U.S.
         dollar value of foreign  portfolio  securities and against increases in
         the dollar cost of foreign securities to be acquired. Writing an option
         on foreign currency  constitutes only a partial hedge, up to the amount
         of the premium received. The Fund could lose money if it is required to
         purchase or sell foreign currencies at disadvantageous  exchange rates.
         If exchange rate movements are adverse to the Fund's position, the Fund
         may forfeit the entire  amount of the premium plus related  transaction
         costs.  These  options  are traded on U.S.  and  foreign  exchanges  or
         over-the-counter.  The Fund may write  (sell)  covered call options and
         secured put options on up to 25% of net assets and may purchase put and
         call  options  provided  that no  more  than  5% of net  assets  may be
invested in premiums on such options.                         

Foreign Securities. The Funds, other than the Municipal Bond Fund, may invest in
certain  foreign  securities;  however,  the only foreign  securities the Growth
Opportunity  Fund may invest in are  securities  of  Canadian  based  companies.
Investment  in  securities  of foreign  issuers  and in  obligations  of foreign
branches of domestic banks involves  somewhat  different  investment  risks from
those  affecting  securities  of U.S.  domestic  issuers.  There may be  limited
publicly  available  information  with respect to foreign  issuers,  and foreign
issuers are not generally subject to uniform accounting,  auditing and financial
standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic companies.
Dividends and interest paid by foreign issuers may be subject to withholding and
other foreign taxes which may decrease the net return on foreign  investments as
compared to dividends and interest paid to the Funds by domestic companies.     

Investors  should  realize that the value of the Funds'  investments  in foreign
securities  may  be  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  political  or  social
conditions,   diplomatic  relations,   confiscatory   taxation,   expropriation,
nationalization,  limitation on the removal of funds or assets, or imposition of
(or change in) exchange  control or tax regulations in those foreign  countries.
In  addition,  changes in  government  administrations  or  economic or monetary
policies  in the  United  States  or abroad  could  result  in  appreciation  or
depreciation of portfolio  securities and could favorably or unfavorably  affect
the Funds' operations.  Furthermore, the economies of individual foreign nations
may differ from the U.S.  economy,  whether  favorably or unfavorably,  in areas
such  as  growth  of  gross  national  product,   rate  of  inflation,   capital
reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments position; it may
also be more  difficult  to  obtain  and  enforce a  judgment  against a foreign
issuer.  Any foreign  investments  made by the Funds must be made in  compliance
with U.S. foreign currency restrictions and tax laws restricting the amounts and
types of foreign investments.                                                   

Investments  are made  primarily in those regions  where,  in the opinion of the
Funds' Adviser,  there are opportunities to achieve superior  investment returns
relative  to other  investment  opportunities  outside  the United  States.  The
International  Fund  does  not,  however,  generally  invest  in debt or  equity
securities of U.S. issuers.  The International  Fund emphasizes those industrial
sectors of the world's  market which,  in the opinion of its Adviser,  offer the
most attractive  risk/reward  relationships.  Securities of any given issuer are
evaluated on the basis of such  measures as  price/earnings  ratios,  price/book
ratios, cash flows and dividend and interest income.                            

Since  investments in foreign  securities may involve  foreign  currencies,  the
value of a Fund's assets as measured in U.S.  dollars may be affected  favorably
or unfavorably by changes in currency  rates and exchange  control  regulations,
including currency blockage.                                                    

In  addition,  while the  volume  of  transactions  effected  on  foreign  stock
exchanges has increased in recent  years,  in most cases it remains  appreciably
below that of  domestic  security  exchanges.  Accordingly,  the Funds'  foreign
investments  may be less  liquid  and their  prices  may be more  volatile  than
comparable investments in securities of U.S. companies. Moreover, the settlement
periods for foreign securities, which are often longer than those for securities
of  U.S.  issuers,  may  affect  portfolio  liquidity.  In  buying  and  selling
securities on foreign exchanges,  purchasers normally pay fixed commissions that
are  generally  higher  than the  negotiated  commissions  charged in the United
States.  In  addition,  there  is  generally  less  government  supervision  and
regulation  of  securities  exchanges,  brokers and  issuers  located in foreign
countries than in the United States.                                            

         Canadian  Companies.  The Growth  Opportunity Fund may invest more than
         10% of its total assets in Canadian Securities. Canadian securities are
         sensitive to conditions within Canada, but also tend to follow the U.S.
         market.  The country's  economy  relies  strongly on the production and
         processing of natural resources.  Also, the government has attempted to
         reduce  restrictions   against  foreign   investment,   and  its  trade
         agreements  with the U.S.  and Mexico are  expected to increase  trade.
         Also,  demand by many  citizens in the Province of Quebec for secession
         from Canada may significantly impact the Canadian economy. In addition,
         the value in U.S. dollars of the Fund's assets  denominated in Canadian
       currency may be affected b changes in exchange rates and regulations.

Futures and Options Transactions. As a means of reducing fluctuations in its net
asset value,  a Fund may buy and sell futures  contracts  and options on futures
contracts,  and buy put and call options on portfolio  securities and securities
indices  to hedge its  portfolio.  A Fund may also  write  covered  put and call
options on portfolio  securities to attempt to increase its current income or to
hedge its portfolio.  There is no assurance that a liquid  secondary market will
exist for any particular  futures contract or option at any particular time. The
Fund's ability to establish and close out futures and options  positions depends
on this secondary market.                                                       

       Futures  Contracts.  A futures  contract is a  commitment  by two parties
       under which one party  agrees to make  delivery of an asset  (seller) and
       another  party agrees to take  delivery of the asset at a certain time in
       the future.  A futures contract may involve a variety of assets including
       commodities (such as oil, wheat, or corn) or a financial asset (such as a
       security).  A Fund may purchase and sell financial  futures  contracts to
       hedge against  anticipated  changes in the value of its portfolio without
       necessarily  buying or selling the  securities.  Although some  financial
       futures  contracts  call for making or taking  delivery of the underlying
       securities,  in most cases  these  obligations  are closed out before the
       settlement  date. The closing of a futures  contract is  accomplished  by
       purchasing or selling an identical  offsetting  futures  contract.  Other
financial futures contracts call for cash settlements.            

       A Fund may  purchase  and sell stock  index  futures  contracts  to hedge
       against  anticipated price changes with respect to any stock index traded
       on a recognized  stock  exchange or board of trade. A stock index futures
       contract  is an  agreement  in which  two  parties  agree to take or make
       delivery of an amount of cash equal to the  difference  between the price
       of the  original  contract and the value of the index at the close of the
       last trading day of the contract.  No physical delivery of the underlying
       securities  in the  index  is  made.  Settlement  is made  in  cash  upon
termination of the contract.                                      

       Margin In  Futures  Transactions.  Since a Fund  does not pay or  receive
       money upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract,  it is required to
       deposit an amount of initial margin in cash, U.S.  government  securities
       or highly-liquid  debt securities as a good faith deposit.  The margin is
       returned to the Fund upon termination of the contract.  Initial margin in
       futures   transactions   does  not  involve   borrowing  to  finance  the
transactions.                                                     

       As the value of the underlying  futures  contract changes daily, the Fund
       pays or receives cash, called variation margin, equal to the daily change
       in value of the  futures  contract.  This  process is known as marking to
       market.  Variation  margin does not  represent a borrowing or loan by the
       Fund. It may be viewed as  settlement  between the Fund and the broker of
       the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract expired.  When
       the Fund  purchases  futures  contracts,  an amount of cash  and/or  cash
       equivalents,  equal to the  underlying  commodity  value  of the  futures
       contracts  (less any related  margin  deposits),  will be  deposited in a
       segregated  account  with  the  Fund's  custodian  to  collateralize  the
       position and insure that the use of futures contracts is unleveraged. The
       Fund is also required to deposit and maintain  margin when it writes call
options on futures contracts.                                     

       A Fund  will not enter  into a futures  contract  or  purchase  an option
       thereon for other than hedging  purposes if  immediately  thereafter  the
       initial margin  deposits for futures  contracts held by it, plus premiums
       paid by it for open options on futures contracts,  would exceed 5% of the
       market value of its net assets,  after taking into account the unrealized
       profits and losses on those  contracts it has entered into.  However,  in
       the case of an option that is in-the-money  at the time of purchase,  the
in-the-money amount may be excluded in computing such 5%.

       Put Options on Financial  and Stock Index Futures  Contracts.  A Fund may
       purchase  listed  put  options  on  financial  and  stock  index  futures
       contracts to protect  portfolio  securities  against  decreases in value.
       Unlike  entering  directly into a futures  contract,  which  requires the
       purchaser  to buy a  financial  instrument  on a set date at a  specified
       price, the purchase of a put option on a futures  contract  entitles (but
       does not  obligate)  its  purchaser  to decide on or before a future date
whether to assume a short position at the specified price.        

       Generally,  if the hedged portfolio  securities  decrease in value during
       the term of an option,  the related futures  contracts will also decrease
       in value and the option  will  increase in value.  In such an event,  the
       Fund will normally  close out its option by selling an identical  option.
       If the hedge is  successful,  the proceeds  received by the Fund upon the
       sale of the second option will be large enough to offset both the premium
       paid by the Fund for the  original  option plus the  decrease in value of
the hedged securities.                                            

       Alternatively,  a Fund may  exercise  its put  option  to  close  out the
       position. To do so, it would simultaneously enter into a futures contract
       of the type underlying the option (for a price less than the strike price
       of the option) and exercise  the option.  The Fund would then deliver the
       futures  contract in return for payment of the strike price.  If the Fund
       neither closes out nor exercises an option, the option will expire on the
       date provided in the option  contract,  and only the premium paid for the
contract will be lost.                                            

       A Fund may also write  (sell)  listed put options on  financial  or stock
       index  futures  contracts  to hedge its  portfolio  against a decrease in
       market  interest  rates or an increase in stock  prices.  A Fund will use
       these  transactions  to purchase  portfolio  securities  in the future at
       price levels existing at the time it enters into the transaction.  When a
       Fund sells a put on a futures  contract,  it  receives a cash  premium in
       exchange  for  granting to the buyer of the put the right to receive from
       the Fund, at the strike price, a short position in such futures contract.
       This is so even  though the strike  price upon  exercise of the option is
       greater than the value of the futures  position  received by such holder.
       As market  interest rates decrease or stock prices  increase,  the market
       price of the underlying  futures contract  normally  increases.  When the
       underlying  futures contract  increases,  the buyer of the put option has
       less  reason  to  exercise  the put  because  the buyer can sell the same
       futures  contract at a higher  price in the  market.  If the value of the
       underlying futures position is not such that exercise of the option would
       be  profitable to the option  holder,  the option will  generally  expire
       without  being  exercised.  The premium  received by the Fund can then be
       used to offset the higher prices of portfolio  securities to be purchased
in the future.                                                    

       In order to avoid the exercise of an option sold by it,  generally a Fund
       will cancel its  obligation  under the option by entering  into a closing
       purchase  transaction,  unless  it is  determined  to be  in  the  Fund's
       interest to deliver the underlying  futures position.  A closing purchase
       transaction  consists of the purchase by the Fund of an option having the
       same term as the option sold by the Fund, and has the effect of canceling
       the Fund's  position as a seller.  The premium which the Fund will pay in
       executing a closing  purchase  transaction may be higher than the premium
       received  when the  option  was sold,  depending  in large  part upon the
       relative  price of the  underlying  futures  position at the time of each
       transaction.  If the hedge is  successful,  the cost of buying the second
       option will be less than the premium received by the Fund for the initial
option.                                                           

       Call Options on Financial and Stock Index Futures  Contracts.  A Fund may
       write (sell)  listed and  over-the-counter  call options on financial and
       stock  index  futures  contracts  to hedge its  portfolio.  When the Fund
       writes a call  option  on a futures  contract,  it  undertakes  to sell a
       futures  contract  at the fixed  price at any time during the life of the
       option.  As stock prices fall or market interest rates rise,  causing the
       prices of futures to go down,  the  Fund's  obligation  to sell a futures
       contract  costs less to  fulfill,  causing  the value of the Fund's  call
       option position to increase.  In other words,  as the underlying  futures
       price goes down below the  strike  price,  the buyer of the option has no
       reason to exercise the call, so that the Fund keeps the premium  received
       for the option.  This premium can substantially  offset the drop in value
of the Fund's portfolio securities.                               

       Prior to the expiration of a call written by a Fund, or exercise of it by
       the  buyer,  the Fund may  close out the  option  by buying an  identical
       option. If the hedge is successful, the cost of the second option will be
       less than the premium  received by the Fund for the initial  option.  The
       net  premium  income  of the Fund  will  then  substantially  offset  the
decrease in value of the hedged securities.                       

       A Fund may buy a listed call option on a financial or stock index futures
       contract to hedge against decreases in market interest rates or increases
       in stock price. A Fund will use these  transactions to purchase portfolio
       securities  in the future at price levels  existing at the time it enters
       into the transaction. When a Fund purchases a call on a financial futures
       contract,  it receives in exchange  for the payment of a cash premium the
       right,  but not the  obligation,  to enter  into the  underlying  futures
       contract at a strike price determined at the time the call was purchased,
       regardless of the  comparative  market value of such futures  position at
       the time the option is  exercised.  The  holder of a call  option has the
       right to receive a long (or buyer's)  position in the underlying  futures
       contract.  As market  interest rates fall or stock prices  increase,  the
       value  of  the  underlying   futures  contract  will  normally  increase,
       resulting in an increase in value of the Fund's option position. When the
       market  price of the  underlying  futures  contract  increases  above the
       strike price plus premium  paid,  the Fund could  exercise its option and
       buy the futures  contract  below market  price.  Prior to the exercise or
       expiration  of the call  option,  the Fund could sell an  identical  call
       option and close out its position.  If the premium  received upon selling
       the offsetting call is greater than the premium originally paid, the Fund
has completed a successful hedge.                                 

       Limitation  on Open  Futures  Positions.  A Fund will not  maintain  open
       positions in futures contracts it has sold or call options it has written
       on futures  contracts if together the value of the open positions exceeds
       the  current  market  value of the  Fund's  portfolio  plus or minus  the
       unrealized  gain  or loss  on  those  open  positions,  adjusted  for the
       correlation of volatility  between the hedged  securities and the futures
       contracts. If this limitation is exceeded at any time, the Fund will take
       prompt action to close out a sufficient number of open contracts to bring
its open futures and options positions within this limitation.    

       Purchasing  Put and Call Options on  Securities.  A Fund may purchase put
       options on portfolio securities to protect against price movements in the
       Fund's  portfolio.  A put option gives the Fund, in return for a premium,
       the right to sell the  underlying  security  to the writer  (seller) at a
       specified  price during the term of the option.  A Fund may purchase call
       options on securities  acceptable  for purchase to protect  against price
       movements by locking in on a purchase price for the underlying  security.
       A call option gives the Fund,  in return for a premium,  the right to buy
       the underlying  security from the seller at a specified  price during the
term of the option.                                               

       Writing  Covered  Call and Put  Options on  Securities.  A Fund may write
       covered  call and put  options to  generate  income and  thereby  protect
       against price movements in the Fund's portfolio securities.  As writer of
       a call option,  the Fund has the obligation,  upon exercise of the option
       during the option period, to deliver the underlying security upon payment
       of the  exercise  price.  The Fund may only sell call  options  either on
       securities held in its portfolio or on securities  which it has the right
       to obtain  without  payment of further  consideration  (or has segregated
       cash  or U.S.  government  securities  in the  amount  of any  additional
       consideration).  As a writer of a put option, the Fund has the obligation
       to purchase a security from the purchaser of the option upon the exercise
       of the option.  In the case of put options,  the Fund will segregate cash
       or U.S.  Treasury  obligations  with a value equal to or greater than the
exercise price of the underlying securities.                      

       Stock Index  Options.  A Fund may purchase or sell put or call options on
       stock indices  listed on national  securities  exchanges or traded in the
       over-the-counter  market.  A stock index  fluctuates  with changes in the
       market values of the stocks  included in the index.  Upon the exercise of
       the option, the holder of a call option has the right to receive, and the
       writer of a put option has the  obligation  to  deliver,  a cash  payment
       equal to the  difference  between the closing  price of the index and the
       exercise price of the option. The effectiveness of purchasing stock index
       options  will  depend  upon the extent to which  price  movements  in the
       Fund's  portfolio  correlate  with  price  movements  of the stock  index
       selected.  The value of an index  option  depends  upon  movements in the
       level  of  the  index  rather  than  the  price  of a  particular  stock.
       Accordingly, successful use by a Fund of options on stock indices will be
       subject to the Adviser correctly  predicting  movements in the directions
       of the stock market generally or of a particular industry.  This requires
       different  skills and techniques than predicting  changes in the price of
individual stocks.                                                

       Over-the-Counter   Options.   Over-the-counter   options  are   two-party
       contracts with price and terms  negotiated  between buyer and seller.  In
       contrast,   exchange-traded   options  are  third-party   contracts  with
       standardized  strike prices and expiration dates and are purchased from a
       clearing  corporation.  Exchange-traded  options have a continuous liquid
       market  while  over-the-counter  options  may not.  A Fund may  generally
       purchase and write  over-the-counter  options on portfolio  securities or
       securities indices in negotiated  transactions with the buyers or writers
       of the  options  when  options  on the  Fund's  portfolio  securities  or
       securities indices are not traded on an exchange.  The Fund purchases and
       writes  options  only  with   investment   dealers  and  other  financial
institutions deemed creditworthy by Adviser.                      

       Risks.  When a Fund uses  futures  and  options  on  futures  as  hedging
       devices,  there is a risk that the  prices of the  securities  or foreign
       currency  subject to the futures  contracts may not  correlate  perfectly
       with the prices of the  securities  or currency in the Fund's  portfolio.
       This may cause the  futures  contract  and any  related  options to react
       differently  to market  changes than the portfolio  securities or foreign
       currency. In addition, the Adviser could be incorrect in its expectations
       about the  direction  or extent of  market  factors  such as stock  price
       movements  or  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  In these
events, the Fund may lose money on the futures contract or option.

       When a Fund  purchases  futures  contracts,  an  amount  of cash and cash
       equivalents,  equal to the  underlying  commodity  value  of the  futures
       contracts  (less any related  margin  deposits),  will be  deposited in a
       segregated   account  with  the  Fund's  custodian  or  the  broker,   to
       collateralize  the  position  and  thereby  insure  that  the use of such
       futures contract is unleveraged.  When the Fund sells futures  contracts,
       it will either own or have the right to receive the underlying  future or
       security,  or  will  make  deposits  to  collateralize  the  position  as
discussed above.                                                  

High Yield  Securities.  The  issuers  of debt  obligations  having  speculative
characteristics may experience  difficulty in paying principal and interest when
due in the  event  of a  downturn  in the  economy  or  unanticipated  corporate
developments.  The market  prices of such  securities  may  become  increasingly
volatile in periods of economic uncertainty.  Moreover, adverse publicity or the
perceptions of investors  over which the Adviser has no control,  whether or not
based on  fundamental  analysis,  may decrease the market price and liquidity of
such investments.  Although the Adviser will attempt to avoid exposing each Fund
to such risks, there is no assurance that it will be successful or that a liquid
secondary  market will  continue to be  available  for the  disposition  of such
securities.  International  Fund,  Core  Equities Fund and Fixed Income Fund may
purchase  or hold not more than 5% of its net assets in  securities  rated below
investment  grade  (but  not  lower  than  the  sixth  highest  rating).  Growth
Opportunity  Fund  may  purchase  or hold  not  more  than 5% or its  assets  in
convertible  debt  securities  regardless of their ratings.  Municipal Bond Fund
will not invest in securities rated below investment grade.                     

The market for unrated  securities  may not be as liquid as the market for rated
securities,  which may result in depressed  prices for the Funds in the disposal
of such nonrated securities.  There is no established  secondary market for many
of these  securities.  The Adviser cannot  anticipate  whether these  securities
could be sold other than to  institutional  investors.  There is  frequently  no
secondary  market for the resale of those debt  obligations that are in default.
The limited market for these securities may affect the amount actually  realized
by each Fund upon such sale. Such sale may result in a loss to each Fund.  There
are certain risks involved in applying  credit ratings as a method of evaluating
high yield  securities.  For example,  while credit rating agencies evaluate the
safety of principal and interest payments,  they do not evaluate the market risk
of the securities and the securities may decrease in value as a result of credit
developments.                                                                   

Lower rated and  nonrated  securities  tend to offer  higher  yields than higher
rated securities with the same maturities  because the  creditworthiness  of the
obligors of lower rated  securities may not have been as strong as that of other
issuers.  Since  there is a general  perception  that  there are  greater  risks
associated with the  lower-rated  securities in each Fund, the yields and prices
of such securities tend to fluctuate more with changes in the perceived  quality
of the credit of their  obligors.  In  addition,  the market value of high yield
securities may fluctuate  more than the market value of higher rated  securities
since high yield securities tend to reflect short-term market  developments to a
greater  extent than higher  rated  securities,  which  fluctuate  primarily  in
response to the general level of interest rates, assuming that there has been no
change  in the  fundamental  credit  quality  of  such  securities.  High  yield
securities  are also more  sensitive  to  adverse  economic  changes  and events
affecting specific issuers than are higher rated securities. Periods of economic
uncertainty  can be expected to result in increased  market price  volatility of
the high  yield  securities.  High yield  securities  may also be  directly  and
adversely  affected by variables  such as interest  rates,  unemployment  rates,
inflation  rates and real growth in the economy and may be more  susceptible  to
variables such as adverse  publicity and negative  investor  perception than are
more highly rated securities,  particularly in a limited secondary market. Lower
rated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal
than higher rated  securities.  The obligors of lower rated  securities  possess
less creditworthy  characteristics than the obligors of higher rated securities,
as is evidenced by those  securities  that have  experienced  a  downgrading  in
rating or that are in default. The evaluation of the price of such securities is
highly  speculative and volatile.  As such, these evaluations are very sensitive
to the latest available public information  relating to developments  concerning
such securities.                                                                

Illiquid and Restricted Securities.  The Funds may purchase securities which are
subject  to legal or  contractual  delays,  restrictions,  and costs on  resale.
Because  of time  limitations,  the Funds  might not be able to dispose of these
securities at reasonable  prices or at times  advantageous to the Fund. The Fund
intends  to limit the  purchase  of  restricted  securities  which have not been
determined  by  the  Adviser  to  be  liquid,  together  with  other  securities
considered  to  be  illiquid,  including  repurchase  agreements  providing  for
settlement  in more than seven days  after  notice,  to not more than 15% of its
assets.                                                                         

Inverse Floaters.  Certain securities issued by agencies of the U.S.  government
(agency  securities)  that include a class  bearing a floating  rate of interest
also may include a class whose yield floats inversely  against a specified index
rate. These "inverse  floaters" are more volatile than conventional fixed income
or floating rate classes of an agency security and the yield thereon, as well as
the value thereof,  will fluctuate in inverse proportion to changes in the index
on which  interest  rate  adjustments  are based.  As a result,  the yield on an
inverse floater class of an agency security will generally  increase when market
yields (as  reflected by the index)  decrease and  decrease  when market  yields
increase. The extent of the volatility of inverse floaters depends on the extent
of anticipated changes in market rates of interest.  Generally, inverse floaters
provide for interest  rate  adjustments  based upon a multiple of the  specified
interest  index,  which  further  increases  their  volatility.  The  degree  of
additional  volatility will be directly proportional to the size of the multiple
used in determining interest rate adjustments.                                  

Lending of Portfolio Securities.  In order to generate additional income, a Fund
may  lend  portfolio  securities  to  securities   broker-dealers  or  financial
institutions  if: (1) the loan is  collateralized  in accordance with applicable
regulatory requirements including collateralization continuously at no less than
100% by marking to market  daily,  (2) the loan is subject to  termination  by a
Fund at any time, (3) a Fund receives reasonable interest or fee payments on the
loan,  (4) a Fund is able to  exercise  all voting  rights  with  respect to the
loaned  securities  and (5) the loan  will not  cause  the  value of all  loaned
securities to exceed one-third of the value of a Fund's assets.                 

If the borrower fails to maintain the requisite  amount of collateral,  the loan
automatically  terminates  and a Fund could use the  collateral  to replace  the
securities  while holding the borrower liable for any excess of replacement cost
over the value of the  collateral.  As with any  extension of credit,  there are
risks of delay in recovery  and in some cases even loss of rights in  collateral
should the borrower of the securities fail financially.  The International  Fund
does not currently  intend to lend  portfolio  securities in excess of 5% of its
total assets. The Core Equities Fund, Growth Opportunity Fund, Fixed Income Fund
and Municipal Bond Fund do not currently intend to lend portfolio securities.   

Money  Market  Instruments.  The Funds may  invest in money  market  instruments
including   obligations   of  the  U.S.   government   and  its   agencies   and
instrumentalities,  other short-term debt  securities,  commercial  paper,  bank
obligations and money market mutual funds.                                      

Mortgage-Backed  Securities.  Fixed  Income  Fund may invest in  mortgage-backed
securities.  Generally,  homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages at
any time without penalty.  Homeowners  frequently  refinance high rate mortgages
when mortgage  rates fall.  This results in the  prepayment  of mortgage  backed
securities,  which  deprives  holders of the  securities  of the higher  yields.
Conversely,  when  mortgage  rates  increase,  prepayments  due to  refinancings
decline.  This extends the life of mortgage backed securities with lower yields.
As a result, increases in prepayments of premium mortgage backed securities,  or
decreases in  prepayments of discount  mortgage  backed  securities,  may reduce
their yield and price.                                                          

This  relationship  between  interest rates and mortgage  prepayments  makes the
price of mortgage backed securities more volatile than most other types of fixed
income securities with comparable credit risks.  Mortgage backed securities tend
to pay higher yields to compensate for this volatility.                         
       Collateralized   Mortgage   Obligations  (CMOs).  The  following  example
       illustrates how mortgage cash flows are prioritized in the case of CMOs -
       most of the CMOs in which  the Fixed  Income  Fund  invests  use the same
       basic  structure:  (1) Several classes of securities are issued against a
       pool of mortgage collateral.  A common structure may contain four classes
       of securities.  The first three (A, B, and C bonds) pay interest at their
       stated rates  beginning with the issue date, and the final class (Z bond)
       typically  receives  any excess  income from the  underlying  investments
       after payments are made to the other classes and receives no principal or
       interest  payments until the shorter  maturity classes have been retired,
       but then receives all remaining principal and interest payments;  (2) The
       cash  flows  from  the  underlying  mortgages  are  applied  first to pay
       interest and then to retire securities; (3) The classes of securities are
       retired  sequentially.  All principal  payments are directed first to the
       shortest-maturity class (or A bond). When those securities are completely
       retired,   all   principal   payments  are  then  directed  to  the  next
       shortest-maturity  security (or B bond). This process continues until all
of the classes have been paid off.                                

       Because the cash flow is distributed sequentially instead of pro rata, as
       with  pass-through  securities,  the cash flows and average lives of CMOs
       are more  predictable,  and  there is a period of time  during  which the
       investors in the  longer-maturity  classes receive no principal paydowns.
       The interest  portion of these  payments is  distributed  by the Funds as
income, and the capital portion is reinvested.                    

Municipal  Securities.  Municipal  Securities  are  generally  issued to finance
public works such as  airports,  bridges,  highways,  housing,  hospitals,  mass
transpiration  projects,  schools,  streets, and water and sewer works. They are
also  issued  to repay  outstanding  obligations,  to raise  funds  for  general
operating  expenses,  and  to  make  loans  to  other  public  institutions  and
facilities.                                                                     

P-->485APOS11th�"Page"�of�23TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
Municipal securities include industrial development bonds issued by or on behalf
of public authorities to provide financing aid to acquire sites or construct and
equip facilities for privately or publicly owned corporations.  The availability
of this financing  encourages these corporations to locate within the sponsoring
communities and thereby increases local employment.                             

The  two  principal   classifications  of  municipal   securities  are  "general
obligation" and "revenue"  bonds.  General  obligation  bonds are secured by the
issuer's pledge of its full faith and credit and taxing power for the payment of
principal and interest. Interest on and principal of revenue bonds, however, are
payable only from the revenue  generated by the facility financed by the bond or
other specified  sources of revenue.  Revenue bonds do not represent a pledge of
credit or  create  any debt of or  charge  against  the  general  revenues  of a
municipality or public  authority.  Industrial  development  bonds are typically
classified as revenue bonds.                                                    

       Municipal  Leases.  Municipal leases are obligations  issued by state and
       local  governments or authorities to finance the acquisition of equipment
       and facilities and may be considered illiquid.  They may take the form of
       a  lease,  an  installment  purchase  contract,  or a  conditional  sales
contract.                                                         

       Lease  obligations  may be limited by municipal  charter or the nature of
       the appropriation for the lease. In particular,  lease obligations may be
       subject to periodic  appropriation.  If the entity  does not  appropriate
       funds for future lease  payments,  the entity cannot be compelled to make
       such  payments.  Furthermore,  a lease may provide that the  participants
       cannot accelerate lease  obligations upon default.  The participant would
       only be able to enforce  lease  payments as they became due. In the event
       of a default  or  failure  of  appropriation,  unless  the  participation
       interests are credit enhanced, it is unlikely that the participants would
be able to obtain an acceptable substitute source of payment.     

       Variable  Rate  Municipal  Securities.  The Fund may  purchase  municipal
       securities that have variable interest rates. Variable interest rates are
       ordinarily stated as a percentage of a published interest rate,  interest
       rate index, or some similar  standard,  such as the 91-day U.S.  Treasury
bill rate.                                                        

       Many  variable  rate  municipal  securities  are  subject  to  payment of
       principal on demand by the Fund usually in not more than seven days.  All
       variable rate municipal  securities  will meet the quality  standards for
the Fund.                                                         

       Municipal Bond Insurance.  The Municipal Bond Fund may purchase municipal
       securities  covered by insurance  which  guarantees the timely payment of
       principal  at maturity  and interest on such  securities.  These  insured
       municipal  securities  are either  (1)  covered  by an  insurance  policy
       applicable to a particular  security,  whether  obtained by the issuer of
       the  security  or by a third  party  (Issuer-Obtained  Insurance)  or (2)
       insured  under  master  insurance   policies  issued  by  municipal  bond
       insurers,  which may be  purchased  by the  Fund.  The  premiums  for the
       Policies may be paid by the Fund and the yield on the Fund's  investments
may be reduced thereby.                                           

       The Fund may require or obtain  municipal bond insurance when  purchasing
       municipal  securities  which would not otherwise  meet the Fund's quality
       standards.  The Fund may also require or obtain  municipal bond insurance
       when purchasing or holding specific  municipal  securities,  when, in the
       opinion of the Fund's Adviser, such insurance would benefit the Fund (for
       example,  through improvement of portfolio quality or increased liquidity
       of  certain   securities).   Issuer-Obtained   Insurance   policies   are
       noncancellable and continue in force as long as the municipal  securities
       are outstanding and their  respective  insurers remain in business.  If a
       municipal  security is covered by  Issuer-Obtained  Insurance,  then such
 security need not be insured by the Policies purchased by the Fund.

Participation  Interests.  The  Municipal  Bond Fund may purchase  participation
interests  from  financial   institutions  such  as  commercial  banks,  savings
associations,  and insurance companies.  These participation  interests give the
Fund an undivided interest in municipal securities.  The financial  institutions
from which the Fund  purchases  participation  interests  frequently  provide or
secure  irrevocable   letters  of  credit  or  guarantees  to  assure  that  the
participation  interests are of high quality.  The Directors will determine that
participation interests meet the prescribed quality standards of the Fund.      

Preferred Stocks have the right to receive specified  dividends or distributions
before the payment of dividends or distributions on common stock. Some preferred
stocks also  participate  in dividends and  distributions  paid on common stock.
Preferred  stocks may  provide for the issuer to redeem the stock on a specified
date.  The Fund may treat  such  redeemable  preferred  stock as a fixed  income
security.                                                                       

Repurchase  Agreements.  A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the
purchaser (i.e., a Fund) acquires a debt security and the seller agrees,  at the
time of the sale, to repurchase  the  obligation at a mutually  agreed upon time
and price,  thereby determining the yield during the purchaser's holding period.
This results in a fixed rate of return insulated from market fluctuations during
such period.  The underlying  securities are ordinarily  U.S.  Treasury or other
government  obligations  or high quality money market  instruments.  A Fund will
require that the value of such  underlying  securities,  together with any other
collateral  held by the  Fund,  always  equals  or  exceeds  the  amount  of the
repurchase  obligations  of the vendor.  While the  maturities of the underlying
securities in repurchase  agreement  transactions may be more than one year, the
term of such  repurchase  agreement  will always be less than one year. A Fund's
risk  is  primarily  that,  if  the  seller  defaults,  the  proceeds  from  the
disposition  of  underlying  securities  and other  collateral  for the seller's
obligation are less than the repurchase  price. If the seller becomes  bankrupt,
the Fund  might be  delayed  in selling  the  collateral.  Under the  Investment
Company Act of 1940,  as amended (the "1940  Act"),  repurchase  agreements  are
considered loans.  Repurchase  agreements usually are for short periods, such as
one week or less, but could be longer.  The Funds will not enter into repurchase
agreements  of a duration of more than seven days if, taken  together with other
illiquid  securities,  more  than  15% of that  Fund's  net  assets  would be so
invested.  Under normal market  conditions,  the Funds do not intend to purchase
repurchase agreements in excess of 5% of that Fund's net assets.                

Shares of Other  Investment  Companies.  The Funds may  invest  their  assets in
securities of other  investment  companies as an efficient means of carrying out
their investment policies.  Investment companies incur certain expenses, such as
management fees, and, therefore,  any investment by the Funds in shares of other
investment companies may be subject to such duplicate expenses.                 

Small  and  Mid  Capitalization   Stocks.   Small  market  companies  (Small-Cap
Companies)  are those with market  capitalizations  of $4 billion or less at the
time of Growth Opportunity Fund's investment. Many Small-Cap Companies will have
had their securities publicly traded, if at all, for only a short period of time
and will not have had the  opportunity to establish a reliable  trading  pattern
through economic cycles.  Investing in small and mid  capitalization  stocks may
involve  greater  risk than  investing in large  capitalization  stocks and more
established  companies,  since they can be subject  to greater  volatility.  The
price volatility of Small-Cap  Companies is relatively higher than larger,  more
mature companies. The greater price volatility of Small-Cap Companies may result
from the fact that there may be less market liquidity, less information publicly
available  or few  investors  who monitor  the  activities  of these  companies.
Further, in addition to exhibiting greater  volatility,  the stocks of Small-Cap
Companies may, to some degree,  fluctuate  independently  of the stocks of large
companies.  That is, the stocks of Small-Cap  Companies  may decline in price as
the price of large company  stocks rise or vice versa.  In addition,  the market
prices of these  securities may exhibit more  sensitivity to changes in industry
or general economic  conditions.  Some Small-Cap Companies will not have been in
existence long enough to experience  economic cycles or to know whether they are
sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or inflationary periods. Further,
a variety of factors may affect the success of a company's  business  beyond the
ability of its management to prepare or compensate for them,  including domestic
and international political developments,  government trade and fiscal policies,
patterns of trade and war or other military conflict which may affect particular
industries or markets or the economy generally.                                 

Mid  capitalization   companies  (Mid-Cap   Companies)  are  those  with  market
capitalizations  between $1 billion and $4 billion.  The risks  associated  with
investments in Mid-Cap  Companies are similar to those associated with Small-Cap
Companies as discussed above.                                                   

Short Sales. Core Equities Fund may make short sales. A short sale occurs when a
borrowed  security  is sold in  anticipation  of a decline in its price.  If the
decline  occurs,  shares equal in number to those sold short can be purchased at
the lower price.  If the price  increases,  the higher  price must be paid.  The
purchased shares are then returned to the original  lender.  Risk arises because
no loss  limit can be placed on the  transaction.  When the Fund  enters  into a
short sale, assets equal to the market price of the securities sold short or any
lesser price at which the Fund can obtain such securities, are segregated on the
Fund's records and  maintained  until the Fund meets its  obligations  under the
short sale.                                                                     

The Fund will not sell  securities  short unless it (1) owns,  or has a right to
acquire, an equal amount of such securities,  or (2) has segregated an amount of
its other assets equal to the lesser of the market value of the securities  sold
short or the amount required to acquire such securities.  The segregated  amount
will not exceed 25% of the Fund's net  assets.  While in a short  position,  the
Fund will retain the securities, rights, or segregated assets. Short selling may
accelerate the recognition of gains.                                            

U.S. Government  Securities.  The Funds may invest in U.S. government securities
which include:                                                                  

   o   direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, such as U.S. Treasury bills,
notes, and bonds;                                             
     o   notes,   bonds,  and  discount  notes  issued  or  guaranteed  by  U.S.
         government  agencies and  instrumentalities  supported y the full faith
and credit of the United States;                              
o   notes bonds,  and discount  notes of U.S.  government  agencies or
instrumentalities  which receive or have access to federal    
funding; and                                                  
o   notes, bonds and discount notes of other U.S. government          
     instrumentalities supported by the credit of the instrumentalities.

Some obligations  issued or guaranteed by agencies or  instrumentalities  of the
U.S. government are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. No
assurances can be given that the U.S.  government will provide financial support
to other  agencies or  instrumentalities,  since it is not  obligated  to do so.
These instrumentalities are supported by:                                       

     o the  issuer's  right to borrow an amount  limited to a  specific  line of
     credit from the U.S.  Treasury;  o the discretionary  authority of the U.S.
     government to purchase certain obligations of an agency or instrumentality;
or o the credit of the agency or instrumentality.                     

Temporary Investments.  Each Fund may maintain up to 100% of its assets in Money
Market  Instruments for temporary,  defensive  purposes.  This reserve  position
provides  flexibility in meeting  redemptions,  expenses,  and the timing of new
investments, and serves as a short-term defense during periods of unusual market
volatility.   The  Money  Market  Instruments  for  the  Core  Equities,  Growth
Opportunity  and Fixed Income Funds include  obligations of the U.S.  government
and its agencies and  instrumentalities,  other short-term debt securities which
are rated in the two top  categories  by Moody's or S&P or, if  unrated,  are of
comparable  quality  as  determined  by  the  Adviser,  commercial  paper,  bank
obligations  and money market mutual  funds.  The Money Market  Instruments  for
International  Fund include domestic and foreign  government  obligations,  bank
obligations,  commercial paper and short-term  securities which are rated in the
top two categories by Moody's or S&P or, if unrated,  are of comparable  quality
as determined by the Adviser.  The Money Market  Instruments  for Municipal Bond
Fund include  taxable or tax-exempt  obligations of the U.S.  government and its
agencies  and  instrumentalities,  short-term  debt  securities  of municipal or
corporate   issuers,   domestic  and  foreign   government   obligations,   bank
obligations,  commercial paper and short-term  securities which are rated in the
two top  categories by Moody's or S&P or, if unrated,  of comparable  quality as
determined  by the Adviser.  Although  Municipal  Bond Fund is permitted to take
temporary,  taxable  investments,  there is no current  intention of  generating
income subject to federal regular income tax.                                   

Variable Rate Demand Notes.  Variable rate demand notes are long-term  corporate
debt  instruments  that have variable or floating  interest  rates and provide a
Fund  with the  right to  tender  the  security  for  repurchase  at its  stated
principal amount plus accrued interest.  Such securities typically bear interest
at a rate that is intended to cause the securities to trade at par. The interest
rate may float or be  adjusted  at  regular  intervals  (ranging  from  daily to
annually),  and is  normally  based on an  interest  rate  index or a  published
interest  rate.  Many  variable  rate  demand  notes  allow a Fund to demand the
repurchase of the security on not more than seven days prior notice. Other notes
only  permit a Fund to tender the  security  at the time of each  interest  rate
adjustment or at other fixed intervals.                                         

Warrants  give a Fund the  option  to buy the  issuer's  stock  or other  equity
securities  at a  specified  price.  The Fund may buy the  designated  shares by
paying the  exercise  price  before the  warrant  expires.  Warrants  may become
worthless  if the price of the stock does not rise above the  exercise  price by
the expiration date. Rights are the same as warrants,  except they are typically
issued to existing  stockholders.  The Fund's do not intend to purchase warrants
and rights in excess of 5% of each Fund's total assets.                         

When-Issued and Delayed Delivery  Transactions.  These  transactions are made to
secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield. Settlement dates
may be a month or more after  entering into these  transactions,  and the market
values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices. Other than
normal  transaction  costs,  no fees or expenses are incurred.  However,  liquid
assets of a Fund are  segregated  on a Fund's  records  at the trade  date in an
amount  sufficient to make payment for the  securities  to be  purchased.  These
assets are marked to market daily and are maintained  until the  transaction has
been settled.                                                                   

Zero Coupon Bonds.  Fixed Income Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds. These are
bonds  which are sold at a  discount  to their  stated  value and do not pay any
periodic interest.

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 

Fundamental Limitations                                                         

The  following  investment  limitations  are  fundamental  and cannot be changed
without shareholder approval. The Funds may not:                                

1. Purchase  securities  on margin or borrow  money,  except  (a) from banks for
   extraordinary or emergency purposes (not for leveraging or investment) or (b)
   by engaging in reverse  repurchase  agreements,  provided that (a) and (b) in
   the  aggregate do not exceed an amount equal to one-third of the value of the
   total  assets  of a Fund  less its  liabilities  (not  including  the  amount
   borrowed) at the time of the borrowing,  and further provided that 300% asset
   coverage is maintained at all times,  and except that a deposit or payment by
   such Fund of initial or variation margin in connection with futures contracts
   or related options  transactions is not considered the purchase of a security
on margin.                                                                

2. Lend portfolio  securities of value  exceeding in the aggregate  one-third of
   the  market  value of a Fund's  total  assets  less  liabilities  other  than
obligations created by these transactions;                                

3. Mortgage,  pledge or hypothecate any assets except that a Fund may pledge not
   more  than  one-third  of its  total  assets  to  secure  borrowings  made in
   accordance with paragraph 1 above. With respect to Core Equities Fund, Growth
   Opportunity  Fund,  Fixed  Income Fund and  Municipal  Bond Fund,  initial or
   variation margin for futures  contracts will not be deemed to be pledges of a
Fund's assets.                                                            

4.   Act as an underwriter  of securities of other issuers,  except insofar as a
     Fund may be deemed an  underwriter  under  the 1933 Act in  disposing  of a
portfolio security.                                                   

5. Purchase or otherwise acquire interests in real estate,  real estate mortgage
   loans or interests,  including limited partnership interests,  in oil, gas or
other mineral exploration, leasing or development programs.               

6. Purchase or acquire  commodities,  commodity  contracts or futures except for
   International Fund which may purchase and write options on foreign currencies
   or enter into forward delivery  contracts for foreign currencies and may also
   purchase foreign index contracts,  and Core Equities Fund, Growth Opportunity
   Fund,  Fixed  Income Fund and  Municipal  Bond Fund may enter into  financial
futures contracts.                                                        

7. Issue senior  securities,  except  insofar as the Funds may be deemed to have
issued a senior security in connection with any permitted borrowing.            

8. With respect to Core Equities Fund,  Growth  Opportunity  Fund,  Fixed Income
   Fund and Municipal Bond Fund, will not invest 25% or more of the value of its
   total assets in any particular industry or groups of related industries;  and
   Municipal  Bond Fund will not invest  25% or more of its total  assets in any
   one industry or in  industrial  development  bonds or other  securities,  the

2. Invest in securities of other investment  companies,  except (a) with respect

   merger,  consolidation  or  acquisition  of  assets  and  further  except  as
   permitted by Section 12(d) of the 1940 Act or by the  Securities and Exchange

is adhered to at the time an  investment  is made, a later change in  percentage
resulting from changes in the value of a Fund's  investment  securities will not
be considered a violation of a Fund's restrictions.

may be effected by the Adviser.  Neither a Fund nor the Adviser has entered into
agreements  or  understandings  with any  brokers  regarding  the  placement  of
securities transactions because of research services they provide. To the extent
that such persons or firms supply investment  information to the Adviser for use
in rendering investment advice to a Fund, such information may be supplied at no
cost to the Adviser and, therefore, may have the effect of reducing the expenses
of the Adviser in rendering advice to that Fund. While it is impossible to place
an actual  dollar  value on such  investment  information,  its  receipt  by the
Adviser  probably  does not reduce the  overall  expenses  of the Adviser to any
material  extent.  Consistent  with the Rules of Fair  Practice of the  National
Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc., and subject to seeking best execution,
the Adviser may consider  sales of shares of a Fund as a factor in the selection
of brokers to execute portfolio transactions for the Funds.                     

The investment  information  provided to the Adviser is of the type described in
Section 28(e) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 and is designed to augment
the  Adviser's  own internal  research  and  investment  strategy  capabilities.
Research  services   furnished  by  brokers  through  which  each  Fund  effects
securities  transactions  are used by the Adviser in carrying out its investment
management responsibilities with respect to all its clients' accounts. There may
be occasions where the transaction  cost charged by a broker may be greater than
that which  another  broker may charge if the Adviser  determines  in good faith
that the amount of such  transaction cost is reasonable in relation to the value
of brokerage and research services provided by the executing broker. The Adviser
may consider the sale of shares of a Fund by brokers  including the  Distributor
as a factor in its selection of brokers of Fund transactions.                   

A Fund may deal in some  instances  in  securities  which  are not  listed  on a
national securities exchange but are traded in the  over-the-counter  market. It
may also purchase listed securities through the third market. Where transactions
are executed in the over-the-counter market or third market, that Fund will seek
to deal with the primary  market  makers;  but when necessary in order to obtain
best execution,  it will utilize the services of others. In all cases, each Fund
will attempt to negotiate best execution.                                       

For the fiscal  year  ended,  October  31,  1998,  the Fund's  adviser  directed
brokerage  transactions  to  certain  brokers  due  to  research  services  they
provided. The total amount of these transactions was $______, for which the Fund
paid $______ in brokerage commissions.                                          

Distribution and Service Plan                                                   
The Corporation  has adopted a distribution  and service plan (the Plan) for the
Funds pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Pursuant to
the Plan,  the Funds  entered into a  distribution  agreement  and a shareholder
servicing  agreement  with  the  Funds'  distributor,  Edgewood  Services,  Inc.
(Edgewood)  and a shareholder  servicing  agreement with Bessemer Trust Company,
N.A. (Bessemer). Under the shareholder servicing agreement, Bessemer may receive
payments  from the Funds to permit it to make  payments  to  broker-dealers  for
providing shareholder  services.  Bessemer is permitted (i) to receive a payment
from the Funds  attributable  to  Bessemer's  clients (and its  affiliates)  for
providing  shareholder  services to such clients and (ii) to receive payments to
permit  it to make  payments  to other  financial  institutions  as  shareholder
servicing agents. Under its shareholder  servicing agreement,  Edgewood receives
payments  from the Funds' to permit it to make  payments to  broker-dealers  for
providing shareholder services.                                                 

The distribution  agreement with Edgewood provides for reimbursement to Edgewood
by the Funds for its distribution, promotional and advertising costs incurred in
connection with the distribution of the Funds' shares.                          

In addition, each Fund will pay for telecommunications  expenses incurred by the
distributor in carrying out its obligations under the distribution agreement and
shareholder  servicing agreement and for costs incurred for preparing,  printing
and delivering the Funds' prospectus to existing  shareholders and preparing and
printing subscription application forms for shareholder accounts.

HOW DO THE FUNDS MEASURE PERFORMANCE?                           

The Funds may advertise each Fund's share  performance by using the Security and
Exchange   Commission's  (SEC)  standard  method  for  calculating   performance
applicable to all mutual funds.  The SEC also permits this standard  performance
information to be accompanied by non-standard performance information.          

Unless otherwise  stated,  any quoted share  performance  reflects the effect of
non-recurring  charges, such as maximum sales charges,  which, if excluded would
increase the total return and yield. The performance of shares depends upon such
variables as: portfolio quality;  average portfolio maturity;  type and value of
portfolio  securities;  changes in interest rates; changes or differences in the
Fund's expenses; and various other factors.                                     

Share  performance  fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings and
offering price per share fluctuate  daily.  Both net earnings and offering price
per share are factors in the computation of yield and total return.             

Total Return                                                                    
Total return  represents the change  (expressed as a percentage) in the value of
Shares over a specific period of time, and includes the investment of income and
capital gains distributions.                                                    

The average  annual total return for a Fund's  shares is the average  compounded
rate of return for a given period that would equate a $1,000 initial  investment
to the ending  redeemable value of that investment.  The ending redeemable value
is computed by  multiplying  the number of Shares owned at the end of the period
by the NAV per Share at the end of the period. The number of Shares owned at the
end of the period is based on the number of Shares purchased at the beginning of
the period with $1,000,  less any  applicable  sales  charge,  adjusted over the
period  by any  additional  Shares,  assuming  the  annual  reinvestment  of all
dividends and distributions.                                                    

When  shares  of a Fund  are in  existence  for less  than a year,  the Fund may
advertise  cumulative total return for that specific period of time, rather than
annualizing the total return.                                                   

Yield                                                                           
The yield of a Fund's shares is calculated by dividing:  (i) the net  investment
income per share  earned by the shares  over a  thirty-day  period;  by (ii) the
maximum  offering price per share on the last day of the period.  This number is
then annualized  using  semi-annual  compounding.  This means that the amount of
income  generated  during the thirty-day  period is assumed to be generated each
month  over  a  12-month  period  and  is  reinvested  every  six  months.   The
tax-equivalent  yield of Municipal Income Fund's shares is calculated  similarly
to the yield,  but is adjusted to reflect  the taxable  yield that shares  would
have had to earn to equal the actual  yield,  assuming a specific tax rate.  The
yield and tax-equivalent yield do not necessarily reflect income actually earned
by shares because of certain adjustments required by the SEC and, therefore, may
not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.     

To  the  extent  financial   institutions  and  broker/dealers  charge  fees  in
connection with services  provided in conjunction with an investment in a Fund's
shares,  the Fund's share  performance  is lower for  shareholders  paying those
fees.

for  illustrative  purposes  only and is not  representative  of past or  future
performance of the Fund. The interest earned by the municipal  securities  owned
by the Fund generally  remains free from federal regular income tax and is often
free from state and local taxes as well. However,  some of the Fund's income may
be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and state and/or local taxes.

ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PRICING OF SHARES                       

Net Asset Value                                                                 
For  purposes of  determining  each  Fund's net asset  value per share,  readily
marketable  portfolio  securities  listed on an exchange  are valued,  except as
indicated  below,  at the last sale price  reflected at the close of the regular
trading  session of the  exchange on the  business day as of which such value is
being  determined.  If there has been no sale on such day,  the  securities  are
valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such day. If no bid or
asked prices are quoted on such day,  then the security is valued by such method
as the Board of  Directors  shall  determine  in good faith to reflect  its fair
market  value.  Fund  securities  traded  on more than one  national  securities
exchange  are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such
value is being  determined as reflected on the tape at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities.                          

Readily marketable securities traded in the over-the-counter  market,  including
listed  securities  whose  primary  market  is  believed  by the  Adviser  to be
over-the-counter are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked prices from
such sources as the Board of Directors  deems  appropriate to reflect their fair
value.                                                                          

United States  government  obligations and other debt  instruments  having sixty
days or less  remaining  until  maturity  are  stated at  amortized  cost.  Debt
instruments  having a greater  remaining  maturity will be valued at the highest
bid price  obtained from a dealer  maintaining an active market in that security
or on the basis of prices obtained from a pricing  service  approved as reliable
by the Board of Directors. All other investment assets, including restricted and
not readily marketable  securities,  are valued under procedures  established by
and under the general  supervision  and  responsibility  of the Fund's  Board of
Directors designed to reflect in good faith the fair value of such securities.  

As  indicated  in the  prospectus,  the net asset value per share of each Fund's
shares will be determined as of the close of the regular  trading session of the
New  York  Stock  Exchange  (the  "NYSE")  on each day that the NYSE is open for
trading.  The NYSE annually  announces the days on which it will not be open for
trading; the most recent announcement  indicates that it will not be open on the
following  days: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day,  Presidents'  Day, Good
Friday,  Memorial  Day,  Independence  Day,  Labor Day,  Thanksgiving  Day,  and
Christmas  Day.  However,  the NYSE  may  close  on days  not  included  in that
announcement.                                                                   

Trading in Foreign Securities                                                   
Trading in foreign  securities  may be  completed  at times  which vary from the
closing of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In computing its net asset value,
the International  Fund values foreign securities at the latest closing price on
the  exchange on which they are traded  immediately  prior to the closing of the
NYSE.  Certain  foreign  currency  exchange  rates may also be determined at the
latest  rate prior to the  closing  of the NYSE.  Foreign  securities  quoted in
foreign   currencies  are  translated  into  U.S.   dollars  at  current  rates.
Occasionally,  events  that affect  these  values and  exchange  rates may occur
between the times at which they are  determined  and the closing of the NYSE. If
such  events  materially  affect  the  value  of  portfolio  securities,   these
securities  may be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the
Directors, although the actual calculation may be done by others.               

Voting Rights                                                                   
Each share of a Fund gives the  shareholder  one vote in Director  elections and
other matters  submitted to shareholders for vote. All Shares of the Corporation
have equal voting  rights,  except that in matters  affecting  only a particular
Fund, only shares of that Fund or class are entitled to vote.                   

Directors  may be  removed  by the  Directors  or by  shareholders  at a special
meeting.  A special meeting of shareholders will be called by the Directors upon
the written  request of shareholders  who own at least 10% of the  Corporation's
outstanding shares of all series entitled to vote.                              

HOW ARE THE FUNDS TAXED?                                        

Federal Income Tax                                                              
The Funds intend to meet  requirements  of Subchapter M of the Internal  Revenue
Code applicable to regulated investment companies. If these requirements are not
met, they will not receive  special tax  treatment  and will pay federal  income
tax.                                                                            

Each Fund will be treated as a single,  separate  entity for federal  income tax
purposes so that  income  earned and  capital  gains and losses  realized by the
Corporation's  other  portfolios  will be separate  from those  realized by each
Fund.                                                                           

Foreign Investments                                                             
Investment  income on certain foreign  securities  purchased by the Funds may be
subject to foreign  withholding  or other taxes that could  reduce the return on
these securities.  Tax treaties between the United States and foreign countries,
however,  may reduce or eliminate the amount of foreign taxes to which the Funds
would be subject.  The effective  rate of foreign tax cannot be predicted  since
the amount of the Funds'  assets to be  invested  within  various  countries  is
uncertain.   However,  the  Funds  intend  to  operate  so  as  to  qualify  for
treaty-reduced tax rates when applicable.                                       

Distributions  from the Funds may be based on  estimates  of book income for the
year. Book income  generally  consists solely of the coupon income  generated by
the portfolio, whereas tax basis income includes gains or losses attributable to
currency fluctuation.  Due to differences in the book and tax treatment of fixed
income securities denominated in foreign currencies,  it is difficult to project
currency  effects on an interim  basis.  Therefore,  to the extent that currency
fluctuations  cannot be anticipated,  a portion of distributions to shareholders
could later be designated as a return of capital, rather than income, for income
tax purposes, which may be of particular concern to simple trusts.              

The Funds may invest in the stock of certain  foreign  corporations  which would
constitute a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC). The Funds may be subject
to federal income taxes upon disposition of PFIC investments.                   

If more than 50% of the value of the Funds' assets at the end of the tax year is
represented by stock or securities of foreign corporations, the Fund may qualify
for certain Code stipulations  that would allow  shareholders to claim a foreign
tax credit or deduction on their U.S.  income tax returns.  The Code may limit a
shareholder's  ability to claim a foreign tax credit.  Shareholders who elect to
deduct their  portion of the Funds'  foreign  taxes rather than take the foreign
tax credit must itemize deductions on their income tax returns.

APPENDIX                                                        

Standard and Poor's Long-Term Debt Rating Definitions                           
AAA--Debt  rated AAA has the  highest  rating  assigned  by  Standard  & Poor's.
Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.               

AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.                  

A--Debt  rated A has a strong  capacity  to pay  interest  and  repay  principal
although it is somewhat more  susceptible  to the adverse  effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.     

BBB--Debt  rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate  capacity to pay interest
and  repay  principal.   Whereas  it  normally  exhibits   adequate   protection
parameters,  adverse  economic  conditions  or changing  circumstances  are more
likely to lead to a weakened  capacity to pay interest and repay  principal  for
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

BB--Debt  rated  BB has less  near-term  vulnerability  to  default  than  other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse  business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions  which  could  lead  to
inadequate  capacity to meet timely  interest  and  principal  payments.  The BB
rating  category  is also  used for debt  subordinated  to  senior  debt that is
assigned an actual or implied BBB-rating.                                       

B--Debt  rated B has a greater  vulnerability  to default but  currently has the
capacity to meet interest payments and principal  repayments.  Adverse business,
financial,  or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to
pay interest and repay  principal.  The B rating  category is also used for debt
subordinated  to  senior  debt that is  assigned  an  actual  or  implied  BB or
BB-rating.                                                                      

CCC--Debt rated CCC has a currently  identifiable  vulnerability to default, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet
timely  payment of interest and repayment of principal.  In the event of adverse
business,  financial,  or  economic  conditions,  it is not  likely  to have the
capacity to pay interest and repay  principal.  The CCC rating  category is also
used for debt  subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied
B or B-rating.                                                                  

CC--The rating CC typically is applied to debt  subordinated to senior debt that
is assigned an actual or implied CCC debt rating.                               

C--The rating C typically is applied to debt  subordinated  to senior debt which
is assigned an actual or implied  CCC-debt  rating.  The C rating may be used to
cover a situation where a bankruptcy  petition has been filed,  but debt service
payments are continued.                                                         

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Long-Term Bond Rating Definitions               
AAA--Bonds which are rated AAA are judged to be of the best quality.  They carry
the smallest  degree of investment  risk and are  generally  referred to as gilt
edged.  Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change,  such changes as can be  visualized  are most  unlikely to impair the
fundamentally strong position of such issues.                                   

AA--Bonds  which are rated AA are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
Together with the AAA group,  they  comprise  what are  generally  known as high
grade  bonds.  They are rated  lower  than the best  bonds  because  margins  of
protection may not be as large as in AAA securities or fluctuation of protective
elements  may be of greater  amplitude  or there may be other  elements  present
which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in AAA securities.   

A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment  attributes and are
to be considered as upper medium grade  obligations.  Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.                  

BAA--Bonds  which are  rated BAA are  considered  as medium  grade  obligations,
(i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured).  Interest payments
and principal  security appear  adequate for the present but certain  protective
elements may be lacking or may be  characteristically  unreliable over any great
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding  investment  characteristics  and in
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

BA--Bonds  which are BA are judged to have  speculative  elements;  their future
cannot be  considered  as well  assured.  Often the  protection  of interest and
principal  payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during
both good and bad times over the future.  Uncertainty of position  characterizes
bonds in this class.                                                            

B--Bonds  which are rated B  generally  lack  characteristics  of the  desirable
investment.  Assurance of interest and principal  payments or of  maintenance of
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

CAA--Bonds  which are  rated CAA are of poor  standing.  Such  issues  may be in
default or there may be present  elements of danger with respect to principal or
interest.                                                                       

CA--Bonds  which are rated CA represent  obligations  which are speculative in a
high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.

C--Bonds  which are rated C are the lowest  rated class of bonds,  and issues so
rated can be regarded as having  extremely  poor prospects of ever attaining any
real investment standing.                                                       

Fitch IBCA, Inc. Long-Term Debt Rating Definitions                              
AAA--Bonds  considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
The  obligor  has an  exceptionally  strong  ability to pay  interest  and repay
principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.   

AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality. The
obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,  although
not quite as strong as bonds  rated AAA.  Because  bonds rated in the AAA and AA
categories are not significantly  vulnerable to foreseeable future developments,
short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated F-1+.                       

A--Bonds  considered  to be  investment  grade and of high credit  quality.  The
obligor's  ability to pay  interest  and repay  principal  is  considered  to be
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                                   

BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality.
The  obligor's  ability to pay interest and repay  principal is considered to be
adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are
more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds,  and therefore  impair timely
payment.  The  likelihood  that the  ratings  of these  bonds  will  fall  below
investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings.                  

BB--Bonds are considered speculative.  The obligor's ability to pay interest and
repay principal may be affected over time by adverse economic changes.  However,
business and financial  alternatives  can be  identified  which could assist the
obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements.                            

B--Bonds  are  considered  highly  speculative.  While  bonds in this  class are
currently meeting debt service requirements, the probability of continued timely
payment of principal  and  interest  reflects the  obligor's  limited  margin of
safety and the need for reasonable business and economic activity throughout the
life of the issue.                                                              

CCC--Bonds have certain identifiable characteristics which, if not remedied, may
lead to  default.  The  ability to meet  obligations  requires  an  advantageous
business and economic environment.                                              

CC--Bonds  are  minimally  protected.  Default  in payment  of  interest  and/or
principal seems probable over time.                                             

C--Bonds are imminent default in payment of interest or principal.              

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Commercial Paper Ratings                        
Prime-1--Issuers  rated  Prime-1 (or  related  supporting  institutions)  have a
superior capacity for repayment of short-term  promissory  obligations.  Prime-1
repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics: 

o        Leading market positions in well established industries.               

o        High rates of return on funds employed.                                

o        Conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt   
and ample asset protection.                                 

o        Broad margins in earning coverage of fixed financial charges and high  
internal cash generation.                                     

o        Well established access to a range of financial markets and assured    
sources of alternate liquidity.                               

Prime-2--Issuers  rated  Prime-1 (or  related  supporting  institutions)  have a
strong capacity for repayment of short-term  promissory  obligations.  This will
normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser
degree.  Earnings trends and coverage ratios,  while sound, will be more subject
to variation.  Capitalization  characteristics,  while still appropriate, may be
more affected by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.

Standard and Poor's Commercial Paper Ratings                                    
A-1--This  designation  indicates  that the  degree of safety  regarding  timely
payment is strong.  Those issues  determined to possess  extremely strong safety
characteristics are denoted with a plus sign (+) designation.                   

A-2--Capacity   for  timely   payment  on  issues  with  this   designation   is
satisfactory.  However,  the  relative  degree  of  safety is not as high as for
issues designated A-1.

FITCH-1--(Highest  Grade)  Commercial  paper assigned this rating is regarded as
having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment.                    

FITCH-2--(Very  Good Grade) Issues  assigned this rating reflect an assurance of
timely payment only slightly less in degree than the strongest issues.

The Old Westbury Funds, Inc. (the "Fund Company"), BNY Mellon Distributors Inc.1 ("Distributor"), and The Bank of New York Mellon (together with the Fund Company and Distributor, the "Applicants"), hereby request an order (the "Order") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Sections 6(c), 10(f) and 17(b) of the Investment Company Act that would exempt Applicants from the provisions of Sections 17(a) and 10(f) of the Investment Company Act (the "Application").��The requested relief would permit principal transactions ("Transactions") effected in the ordinary course of business between series of the Fund Company (each, a "Portfolio" and collectively, the "Portfolios") and The Bank of New York Mellon and/or any entity controlled by, controlling, or under
common control with The Bank of New York Mellon, including the Distributor (collectively, "BNY Mellon").

Applicants request that the Order also apply (a) to any registered open-end management investment company, whether now existing or organized in the future, including any future Portfolios and their wholly owned subsidiaries, if any (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds") (i) for which officers or employees of BNY Mellon may in the future act as officers as described in this Application, or (ii) for which BNY Mellon will in the future serve as Limited-Purpose Underwriter (as defined below) as described in this Application,2 and (b) any successor to all or substantially all of the business, assets, or property of BNY Mellon and to any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with any such successor, provided that any such succession shall be solely by means of a change of organization, such as incorporation, reincorporation,

INTRODUCTION
�
PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively, "PNCGIS") are in the business of providing "back office" processing and related services to clients, including the Funds.3��Pursuant to services agreements dated April 3, 2006, PNCGIS serves as administrator, fund accounting agent, and transfer agent to the Fund Company and its Portfolios.��Certain employees of PNCGIS serve as officers of the Fund Company.��Pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated July 1, 2010, Distributor serves as the principal underwriter to the Fund Company and its Portfolios.
Pursuant to a Custody Agreement dated July 8, 1994, between the Fund Company's custodian, Bessemer Trust Company, and The Bank of New York Mellon, The Bank of New York Mellon provides certain sub-custodial services to the Fund Company and all but one of its Portfolios.4
�







2


Certain Funds currently employ Distributor or a subsidiary of Distributor as principal underwriter, but do not currently engage in Transactions, but may do so in the future.��Additionally, certain Funds do not currently employ Distributor or a subsidiary of Distributor as principal underwriter, but may do so in the future.��The relief requested by this Application would also apply to future Transactions with such Funds.
�

In connection with the transaction described below, PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. was renamed BNY Mellon Distributors Holdings Inc. effective July 1, 2010. The servicing activities described above are currently provided by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. (formerly known as PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc.).��The name PNCGIS is used herein for ease of reference.
�

The Fund Company has engaged Citibank, N.A. to serve as sole custodian for one Portfolio, the Old Westbury Global Opportunities Fund and co-custodian for two other Portfolios, the Old Westbury Global Small & Mid Cap Fund and the Old Westbury Real Return Fund.



�

� 


Prior to July 1, 2010, BNY Mellon was not affiliated with the Fund Company, Distributor, or PNCGIS.��Before such date, from time to time, BNY Mellon engaged in certain principal transactions with the Portfolios.��For example, BNY Mellon engaged in foreign currency transactions ("FX Transactions") with the Portfolios.��In addition, BNY Mellon, through its Global Markets Group, from time to time may have acted as counterparty with respect to certain derivatives transactions with the Portfolios.��Moreover, BNY Mellon from time to time may have engaged in other principal transactions with the Portfolios and served as a principal underwriter to issuers of which the Portfolios could have purchased securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate.
������ On February 2, 2010, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ("Stock Purchase Agreement") with The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation ("BNY Mellon Corp.").��Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. agreed to sell to BNY Mellon Corp. 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (the "Stock Sale").��The Stock Sale included PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc., PFPC Trust Company and Distributor, among other entities.��The Stock Sale was completed on July 1, 2010 (the "Closing Date").
�


� 


- 5 -





� 


As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement and Stock Sale, effective July 1, 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon and Distributor are under the common control of BNY Mellon Corp., and therefore may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other for purposes of Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act.��As of such date, BNY Mellon may be deemed to be prohibited from engaging in certain Transactions pursuant to Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act because BNY Mellon is an affiliated person of the Fund Company's principal underwriter.��In addition, BNY Mellon could be deemed to be prohibited from engaging in certain Transactions pursuant to Section 10(f) of the Investment Company Act, because officers and employees of BNY Mellon serve as officers of the Fund Company.
�� ����Distributor and BNY Mellon are not directly or indirectly affiliated with the investment adviser or sub-adviser to any Portfolio.
� ����When the Investment Company Act was enacted, the principal underwriter to an investment company almost invariably wielded enormous power over the company because the company was entirely dependent on the principal underwriter for access to investors.��This power was particularly pronounced with respect to open-end investment companies, because such companies often are dependent on the constant sale of new securities to replace assets lost through shareholder redemptions.��Similarly, in 1940, officers of a fund typically were affiliated with an entity that controlled the investment decisions or distribution of the fund generally or, at a minimum, were in a position to control or influence investment decisions made on behalf of the fund.��Accordingly, Congress chose to include principal underwriters and officers of a fund within the class of persons subject
to the restrictions of Sections 17(a) and 10(f) of the Investment Company Act.
�




�


� 


- 6 -





� 




�

Unlike the situation that was contemplated when the Investment Company Act was enacted, neither BNY Mellon nor its officers and employees are in any position to control or influence the selection of securities brokers or dealers for the Portfolios, which decisions are made by an unaffiliated investment adviser and sub-advisers.��Moreover, BNY Mellon has little ability to influence the sale of Portfolio shares � the competitive market for distribution services has created the situation where if BNY Mellon and its subsidiary were replaced as principal underwriter, the Fund Company would not lose access to the channels through which its Portfolio shares are sold.��Rather, another broker-dealer simply would assume the responsibility for performing the distribution activities.��To this extent, BNY Mellon, as underwriter, is like the many other service providers to the Fund Company, who similarly have no meaningful power to control
or influence investment adviser decisions.��In any event, the shares of the Portfolios are used as asset allocation vehicles for fiduciary clients of Bessemer Trust Company, N.A. and its affiliates.
Notwithstanding the lack of affiliation between BNY Mellon and the persons responsible for making investment decisions, the absence of leverage that BNY Mellon has over the Fund Company as its underwriter, and the lack of any opportunity for BNY Mellon to influence the securities activities of the Fund Company and its Portfolios, as of the completion of the Stock Sale, the Portfolios are prohibited from engaging in Transactions with BNY Mellon.��


� 


- 7 -





� 


�
Applicants submit that it does not serve the best interests of the Fund Company or the Portfolios by prohibiting them from engaging in Transactions with BNY Mellon and, therefore, seek the relief requested in this Application.
��������The Fund Company has, on behalf of the Portfolios, independently decided to retain BNY Mellon to provide distribution services, as well as the other services provided to the Fund Company by BNY Mellon.��As with all business relationships, the retention of the Distributor was based on a number of factors, including: the confidence that the Fund Company's adviser and board have in BNY Mellon based on several years of regular business dealings with BNY Mellon; the nature of the services required; BNY Mellon's ability to perform the required services; and the cost of the services.��In this regard, the Fund Company and Portfolios have been in operation for a number of years and have utilized the Distributor as their principal underwriter since 2006.
������� The board of the Fund Company, including all of the disinterested members, has determined that the distribution arrangements with BNY Mellon are in the best interests of the Portfolios.��That determination was based on an evaluation of several factors, including the ones described above.���Certainly, it would be possible for the Portfolios to employ an underwriter that is unaffiliated with BNY Mellon.��This would obviate the need for the requested relief with respect to the Transactions.��However, the Fund Company's board and adviser, which both have no incentive to select BNY Mellon as principal underwriter but do have incentives to select the most effective underwriter for the benefit of the Portfolios,
have selected BNY Mellon, based on an evaluation of the factors described above.

The six Sub-Advisers are: Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P., which is responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Small & Mid Cap Fund's portfolio; Champlain Investment Partners, LLC, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Small & Mid Cap Fund's portfolio; Mondrian Investment Partners Limited, which is also responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Small & Mid Cap Fund's portfolio; Franklin Advisers, Inc., which is responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Opportunities Fund's portfolio; Shenkman Capital Management, Inc., which is responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Opportunities Fund's portfolio; and BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., which is also responsible for the day-to-day management of a portion of the Global Opportunities Fund's portfolio.��Applicants request that the
exemptive order cover the Sub-Advisers, provided that any Sub-Adviser that relies on the order complies with the conditions of the order.

PNCGIS, as administrator, also provides administrative officers who are responsible for performing certain functions as more fully discussed below.��No administrative officer of the Fund Company who is an affiliated person of PNCGIS serves as a director of the Fund Company, sets fund policies, or is affiliated with any investment adviser to any Portfolio of the Fund Company.��Such administrative officers have no involvement in, or influence over, the selection of any investment for the Portfolios or any broker or dealer through whom transactions may be effected.
(ii)�����������Custodians
Citibank, N.A. and Bessemer Trust Company each acts as custodian or co-custodian for certain of the Portfolios.9��Bessemer Trust Company, an affiliate of the Fund Company's investment adviser, has entered into a Custody Agreement with BNY Mellon.��In addition, BNY Mellon serves as foreign custody manager for the Portfolios.

�
II.�����������THE TRANSACTIONS
�
As noted above, prior to the Closing Date BNY Mellon engaged in certain principal transactions with the Portfolios.��Effective as of the Closing Date, such Transactions may be deemed to be prohibited due to the affiliation between the Distributor and BNY Mellon.��For the reasons discussed below, Applicants believe that it is in the interest of the Portfolios for the Portfolios to be permitted to engage in the Transactions.
�

Specifically, Bessemer Trust Company serves as sole custodian or co-custodian for each of the Portfolios, other than the Old Westbury Global Opportunities Fund.��It serves as co-custodian for the Old Westbury Global Small & Mid Cap Fund and the Old Westbury Real Return Fund.��As noted above, Citibank, N.A. serves as sole custodian for the Old Westbury Global Opportunities Fund and co-custodian, with Bessemer Trust Company, for the Old Westbury Global Small & Mid Cap Fund and the Old Westbury Real Return Fund.��See supra note 4.

�
A.�����������The FX Transactions
�
From time to time, at the direction of BIM or the Sub-Advisers, a Portfolio enters into FX Transactions in connection with its assets held by BNY Mellon.��Broadly speaking, FX Transactions are effected where the Portfolio holds positions, or engages in transactions, which involve a currency other than the U.S. dollar ("Foreign Currency").��In connection with such transactions, the Portfolio will effect an FX Transaction to convert the Foreign Currency into the U.S. dollar, or vice versa.��For example, an FX Transaction is effected where a Portfolio receives payments in a Foreign Currency with respect to securities held by the Portfolio, or where a Portfolio requires Foreign Currency to settle transactions in securities denominated in a Foreign Currency.��As described more fully below, it is customary within the mutual fund industry that certain FX Transactions are directed to an entity providing custodial services to a
fund ("Custodial Service Provider") due to its expertise, resources, or because of administrative convenience.
A fund's investment adviser or sub-adviser can direct FX Transactions on behalf of the fund in one of two ways: (a) entering into FX Transactions with non-Custodial Service Provider third parties; and (b) entering into FX Transactions with Custodial Service Providers, acting as a principal, either by directly negotiating such transactions with a Custodial Service Provider or by giving standing instructions to a Custodial Service Provider to act as principal in certain FX Transactions with the fund.��The size and nature of the FX Transaction typically factor into the investment adviser's determination in this regard.��For example, to the extent that the investment adviser determines to hedge a fund's currency exposure through the use of a Foreign Currency forward transaction, or to enter into a particular FX Transaction that affects a significant portion of the fund's holdings, the investment adviser may determine to directly
negotiate the FX Transaction with the counterparty, which may or may not be a Custodial Service Provider.
�


� 


- 14 -





� 


In contrast, it is common for investment advisers or sub-advisers to direct other types of FX Transactions � in addition to the FX Transactions described immediately above � to a Custodial Service Provider.��These other types of FX Transactions may include the following: (a) transactions that are of relatively low value, and that have relatively high administrative burdens associated with them, such as the conversion of dividends paid in a Foreign Currency, foreign tax reclaims, or corporate actions such as rights subscriptions or dividend reinvestment plans; and (b) transactions in so-called "regulated markets," such as Malaysia, India, Brazil, and Korea, among others.��These are jurisdictions where local restrictions present hurdles to effecting transactions on a timely basis.��The use of a Custodial Service Provider, which may have staff resident in the local market as well as expertise with respect to local restrictions,
often is the most effective means of executing such transactions.��For these types of transactions, the use of non-Custodial Service Provider third parties may present additional cost, additional administrative burdens, and expose the fund to certain operational risks, all of which may serve to limit the investment adviser's ability to efficiently and successfully execute the transaction for the fund.10
�
Prior to the Closing Date, the Portfolios engaged in FX Transactions with BNY Mellon acting as principal.
�
����





10


There are inherent efficiencies from centralizing, to the extent feasible, a fund's FX transactions.��The use of a non-Custodial Service Provider requires coordination among the adviser or sub-adviser, the custodian, and the counterparty.��In addition, a non-Custodial Service Provider may not have the same capability, in terms of global reach, as the custodian.��The greater the number of counterparties with which a fund engages in FX transactions, the greater the oversight burden, and the greater the number of parties to be contacted to reconcile any transaction discrepancies.

B.�����������The Derivative Transactions
BNY Mellon, through its Global Markets Group, enters into certain derivative transactions as principal with its customers.��The derivative instruments include interest rate swaps; equity options; and instruments relating to Foreign Currency.��The Global Markets Group does not engage in credit- or commodity- related derivative instruments.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Portfolios from time to time may have engaged in such derivative transactions with BNY Mellon.11
C.�����������Other Principal Transactions
The Portfolios may from time to time seek to engage in other Transactions with BNY Mellon acting as: (i) a dealer with respect to equity and fixed-income instruments, including municipal securities, bank loans, and loan participations; or (ii) a lender or borrower of securities.��For example, Pershing LLC ("Pershing"), a registered broker-dealer and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BNY Mellon Corp., provides clearance, custody and execution services to financial intermediaries.��In connection with these services, Pershing performs certain activities that may involve engaging in Transactions directly or indirectly with the Portfolios.��Such activities, include, but are not limited to: acting as a market maker with respect to over 7,500 equity securities; acting as dealer with respect to fixed-income instruments; and acting as a lender of securities.��Pershing may also borrow securities from Funds that participate
in securities lending programs.12��A Fund may pursue short sales as part of their investment strategies and, therefore, be in a position in which the Fund's adviser or sub-adviser would cause the Fund to borrow securities from BNY Mellon.
�







11


The derivative instruments consist principally of interest rate swaps, equity options, and instruments relating to Foreign Currency.��Funds engage in these transactions for portfolio-management reasons, to protect or enhance a Fund's return.��These instruments are part of the adviser's or sub-adviser(s) investment strategy and, therefore, are deemed by the adviser or sub-adviser necessary for better Fund performance.��The Funds could engage in the Derivative Transactions with an entity that is unaffiliated with BNY Mellon.��This would obviate the need for the requested relief with respect to the Derivative Transactions.��However, the Funds' adviser or sub-adviser(s) have no incentive to benefit BNY Mellon but do have strong incentives to direct Derivative Transactions for the benefit of the Funds, would choose to direct these transactions to BNY Mellon based on BNY Mellon's minimal counterparty risk and the costs incurred, and quality
of service received, by the Funds in choosing BNY Mellon.



�





12


The Portfolios do not engage in securities lending activities.

� 


D.�����������The Underwriting Transactions
BNY Mellon, through its subsidiaries, provides underwriting services to entities seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of their securities.��As an underwriter, BNY Mellon facilitates an issuing entity's capital-raising activities by identifying and locating potential investors, and then also arranging for the purchase of the entity's securities by such investors during the offering or syndication period.
�
The Portfolios may from time to time seek to acquire securities during their underwriting or syndication period where BNY Mellon serves as underwriter to the securities.
�
III.�����������RELIEF REQUESTED AND APPLICABLE LAW
�
Pursuant to Sections 6(c), 10(f), and 17(b), Applicants request the Order from the Commission exempting them from Sections 17(a) and 10(f) of the Investment Company Act and allowing BNY Mellon and the Portfolios to enter into Transactions in the ordinary course of business, subject to the representations and conditions contained in this Application.
�
A.�����������Section 17(a)
�
Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act, respectively, generally prohibit any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to such registered investment company and from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.��In addition, Section 17(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, acting as principal, from borrowing money or other property from such registered investment company.����Lastly, Section 17(a)(4) of the Investment Company Act prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter
for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, acting as principal, from loaning money or other property to such registered investment company in contravention of such rules, regulations, or orders as the Commission may prescribe or issue consistent with the protection of investors.13��Because, as of the completion of the Stock Sale, BNY Mellon is an affiliate of the Fund Company's underwriter, Distributor, BNY Mellon may not knowingly engage in principal transactions with the Portfolios absent an exemptive order.
�







13


To date, the Commission has not prescribed or issued any such rules, regulations, or orders.��The Applicants are not seeking exemptive relief from Section 17(a)(4).



�




�


� 


- 17 -





� 


Although officers and employees of BNY Mellon act as officers of the Fund Company as of the completion of the Stock Sale, BNY Mellon believes that it is not a second-tier affiliate of the Fund Company by virtue of such relationships.��Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act provides that:
�
"Affiliated Person" of another person means (A) any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with the power to vote, 5 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person; (B) any person 5 per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person; (C) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person; (D) any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person; (E) if such other person is an investment company, any investment adviser thereof or member of an advisory board thereof; and (F) if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors, the depositor thereof.
�
The officers of the Fund Company are affiliated persons of the Fund Company pursuant to Section 2(a)(3)(D).��Such persons also are affiliated persons of BNY Mellon under Section 2(a)(3)(D) � but the opposite is not true: BNY Mellon is not an affiliated person of its employees or officers.��Section 2(a)(3)(D) states that an officer is an affiliated person of his company, and that an employee is an affiliated person of its employer.��No portion of Section 2(a)(3) provides the opposite, i.e., that an employer is an affiliated person of its employees, or that a company is an affiliated person of its officers.��The fact that the drafters of the Investment Company Act knew that affiliation could run in a single direction is evidenced by the fact that subsections (A) and (B) were both included � each of which covers the opposite side of the same set of relationships.
�


� 


- 18 -





� 


Of course, BNY Mellon could be an affiliated person of its employees or officers by virtue of Section 2(a)(3)(C) if it were deemed to control such persons, in which case it would be a second-tier affiliated person of the Fund Company.��However, Section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act defines the term in the context of control over companies, providing in relevant part that:
�
"Control" means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.
�
To underscore the fact that control is a concept primarily intended to be applied outside of the context of natural persons, Section 2(a)(9) further provides that a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
�
B.�����������Sections 17(b) and 6(c)
�
Section 17(b) of the Investment Company Act authorizes the Commission to issue an order of exemption from one or more of the provisions of Section 17(a) if evidence establishes that: (1) the terms of the proposed transaction "are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned"; (2) "the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned"; and (3) "the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of [the Investment Company Act]."
�


� 


- 19 -





� 


�
To the extent that Applicants seek relief for a series of future transactions, the Commission has the authority under Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act to exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Investment Company Act or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent such exemption is: (1)�"necessary or appropriate in the public interest"; (2)�"consistent with the protection of investors"; and (3)�"consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Investment Company Act]."
�
C.�����������Section 10 (f)
�
Section 10(f) of the Investment Company Act, in relevant part, prohibits a registered investment company from knowingly purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security, during its underwriting or syndication, the principal underwriter of which is (a) an officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or employee of the investment company or (b) a person of which such officer, director, member of any advisory board, investment adviser, or employee is an affiliated person.��As of the Stock Sale, officers and employees of BNY Mellon serve as officers of the Fund Company.��Currently, no such person is an affiliated person of a BNY Mellon entity that provides underwriting services.��To the extent that such person in the future is an affiliated person of a BNY Mellon entity that provides underwriting services, Section 10(f) may be deemed to prohibit the Portfolios from acquiring securities from BNY Mellon during
the securities' underwriting or syndication period when BNY Mellon serves as underwriter of the securities.��Section 10(f) also authorizes the Commission to exempt any transactions or classes of transactions from its restrictions.
�

� 


�
IV.�����������REASONS FOR REQUESTED RELIEF
�
A.�����������Section 17(a)
�
Applicants respectfully submit that the abuses that Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act was designed to redress are not implicated by the Transactions.��Section 17(a) was fashioned by Congress to prevent an underwriter or other party with the power to influence the investment decisions of a registered investment company from inducing the investment company to engage in transactions that unfairly benefit the underwriter, but are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders.��Although BNY Mellon, through Distributor, serves as underwriter for the Fund Company and its Portfolios and has employees that are officers (but not directors) of the Fund Company, BNY Mellon does not exercise influence or control over the investment decisions and investment policies of the Portfolios, and is not in a position to exert pressure on the Portfolios or their investment advisers to engage in transactions
that are not in the Portfolios' best interests.��Applicants also submit that the trading bar between BNY Mellon and the Portfolios imposed by Section 17(a) disadvantages the Portfolios by preventing them from engaging in transactions with a reputable and well regarded firm and, in particular with respect to FX Transactions, preventing the Portfolios from realizing the benefits of directing FX Transactions to BNY Mellon, a leading provider of FX Transaction-related services.��Section 17(a)(3)'s bar prevents a Fund from lending securities to BNY Mellon in securities lending transactions.

1.


The Proposed Principal Transactions Between the Funds and
BNY Mellon Do not Raise the Concerns that Section 17(a) Was
Designed to Address



�




� 


a.


The "Domination of Distribution"



�
Congress passed Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act to address the problems associated with transactions of affiliated persons and underwriters or distributors who are able to control or influence the investment decisions of mutual funds.��As explained by David Schenker, Chief Counsel of the Commission study that led to the enactment of the Investment Company Act, the purpose of this provision was to ensure that, if you are a person or entity providing services to a mutual fund, you would not be in a situation in which you are "sitting on one side representing yourself where you have a pecuniary interest, and you are sitting on the other side representing the investment trust."��Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580 Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 131 (1940) (testimony of Chief Counsel Schenker).
Congress applied the prohibitions of Section 17(a) to underwriters of investment company shares because, at the time of the enactment of the Investment Company Act, underwriters possessed enormous control over investment companies.��The Commission, in its exhaustive Investment Trust Study of the then-largely unregulated investment company industry, devoted over 300 pages exclusively to the problems associated with underwriter control of open-end and closed-end investment company shares.��The Commission encapsulated these problems with the ominous heading: "The Domination of Distribution."��SEC, Investment Trusts and Investment Companies 812 (1940).
�


� 


- 22 -





� 


The Commission's study, which served as the foundation for the Investment Company Act, noted that in the 1930s most open-end investment companies were sponsored by persons closely connected with the subsequent distribution of their shares and practically all these companies were managed by the same persons.��Id. at 823.��The contracts between the parties reflected that relationship between the underwriter and the fund, containing terms that strongly favored the underwriter.��The Commission highlighted a typical distribution contractual relationship that, among other things, appointed the underwriter as the "exclusive selling agent" for more than 10 years and, thereafter, from year-to-year until terminated upon 12 months' notice; entitled the underwriter to a sales load of 9.5 percent of the retail price of shares; and mandated that the investment company provide current fund information for the use
of the underwriter.��Id. at 825.
�
As this contract shows, investment companies frequently were captives of underwriters and their affiliated persons.��Yet the control of the underwriter went beyond the terms of the contract because, as the Commission noted, the underwriter was "the focal point for the purchase and sale of shares."��Id. at 857.��This concern was particularly pronounced for open-end investment companies, because such companies must constantly sell new securities to replace assets lost through shareholder redemptions.
�
Sales of investment company shares could not be accomplished without the underwriter's aid, for it was underwriters and their dealers that provided the large nationwide organizations that would actively promote funds.��Vigorous sales efforts � employing almost every merchandising device from door-to-door sales to extensive advertisements in newspapers, magazines and radios � were utilized 


� 


- 23 -





� 


�
by dealers and underwriters, see id. at 829, and funds lacking such distribution support would not be viable for very long.��Accordingly, funds could be pressured to embark on many devices or practices that favored the underwriter to assure the continued sale of their securities.��Id. at 826-29.
In enacting the Investment Company Act, Congress recognized that this underwriter domination and control of investment funds could result in abuses against mutual funds and their investors.��Congress addressed this domination in part when it enacted Section 15 of the Investment Company Act to, among other things, limit the ability of a principal underwriter to impose long-term distribution agreements on investment companies.��Section 15, however, did not and could not eliminate the de facto power of then-existing underwriters over mutual funds arising from their control over the sale of fund shares.��To assure that this power was not abused, Congress applied to underwriters the trading proscription of Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act, subject to the ability of the Commission to grant exemptions from that proscription.
�




� 


b.


BNY Mellon Lacks Influence or Control Over the
Funds to Cause Them to Engage in the Type of Conduct
that Section 17(a) Sought to Bar



�
Although as of the Stock Sale, BNY Mellon through its subsidiary, Distributor, serves as underwriter for the Fund Company and its Portfolios and its employees function as officers of the Fund Company, BNY Mellon does not have the type of control or influence that concerned Congress and the Commission in 1940, at the time of the passage of the Investment Company Act.
�


� 


- 24 -





� 


�
Section 12(b) of the Investment Company Act prohibits a mutual fund (except a fund meeting the requirements of Section 10(d) of the Investment Company Act) from distributing its shares, except through an underwriter, in contravention of rules prescribed by the Commission. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), associated persons of a mutual fund issuer, who participate in the sale of the fund's shares, normally would be deemed to be brokers subject to the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act14��Therefore, most funds contract with a principal underwriter, as defined in Section 2(a)(29) of the Investment Company Act, to avoid this problem.��However, the scope of services provided by the typical mutual fund underwriter, providing the usual range of distribution-related services as
contemplated by the drafters of the Investment Company Act (a "Full-Service Underwriter") and Limited-Purpose Underwriters, such as the Distributor, differs significantly.
�
In 1997, the staff considered an application for exemption from Sections 17(a) and 10(f) of the Investment Company Act on behalf of the Benchmark Funds, the Commerce Funds and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "Benchmark Application").15���As explained in the Benchmark Application, the applicant Funds retained Goldman Sachs & Co. ("Goldman") as "nominal" underwriter because then-applicable�






14


Rule 3a4-1 under the Exchange Act provides an exception to this registration requirement.��However, Rule 3a4-1's limits on the activities that a person seeking to rely on the Rule may undertake is restrictive.��Accordingly, most fund families choose to contract with a "principal underwriter," as defined in Section 2(a)(29) of the Act, which is a registered broker-dealer under the Exchange Act, to effect the distribution of fund shares.
�

provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act and federal banking regulations were interpreted as prohibiting the bank sponsors of the Benchmark Funds and the Commerce Funds, and the banks' parents/holding companies from distributing shares of the applicant Funds.16��While the Glass-Steagall Act and federal banking restrictions underlying the Benchmark Application do not apply to the Applicants, the services that the Distributor provides to the Funds do not extend beyond those performed by Goldman.��As discussed below, the policy rationale that led the Commission to issue the order requested in the Benchmark Application also supports the issuance of the Order.

�
** Service is provided by an affiliate of the Distributor.

In the case of the Distributor, these activities principally consist of registering with FINRA those employees of a Fund's adviser or its affiliates whose activities require FINRA registration, and providing supervision of these persons with respect to understanding and complying with FINRA rules.��However, the Fund's adviser controls and directs the��sales activities of these persons.��In the case of the Fund Company, there are no employees of BIM, the Sub-Advisers or any of their affiliates who are registered with the Distributor as sales personnel.



�
�


� 


- 27 -





� 




It is important to note that in no sense are the Funds "captives" of the Distributor, either as a matter of contract or, as discussed below, influence.��As the next section demonstrates, the Distributor's limited scope of services means that the Distributor is not a Full-Service Underwriter as understood by the drafters of the Investment Company Act, and, therefore, the Distributor's provision of these Limited-Purpose Underwriter services does not give rise to the policy concerns associated with Full-Service Underwriters, which underlie the inclusion of "principal underwriter" within the scope of Section 17(a) of the Act, and which are described below.
�




� 


c.


Distinguishing Full-Service Underwriters from
Limited-Purpose Underwriters



�
As described above, most funds contract with a principal underwriter, as defined in Section 2(a)(29) of the Investment Company Act, to avoid broker registration issues under the Exchange Act.��However, the scope of services provided by Full-Service Underwriters and Limited-Purpose Underwriters, such as the Distributor, differs dramatically.
�
Both a Full-Service Underwriter and a Limited-Purpose Underwriter usually offer the following services to a family of funds:
�




� 


�


Entering into agreements with financial intermediaries (broker-dealers, banks), which will offer fund shares to their respective customers (each, an "Intermediary");



�




� 


�


Facilitating the payments of sales loads, Rule 12b-1 fees and shareholder servicing compensation to the Intermediaries; and



�
�


� 


- 28 -





� 


�




� 


�


Reviewing advertisements and other promotional material to help assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and providing regulatory supervision of sales personnel, to the extent there are sales personnel.



�
However, in contrast to a Full-Service Underwriter, a Limited-Purpose Underwriter does not, as a matter of contract or practice, take responsibility for the sale of fund shares.18��Because a Full-Service Underwriter does take such responsibility, a Full-Service Underwriter typically will, as examples, provide salespersons who (i) call upon each Intermediary's sales representatives to provide information about the family of funds; (ii) create and provide sales materials and software applications to assist the Intermediary's sales representatives in the sale of the funds' shares to the intermediary's customers and, (iii) in general, service the needs of the Intermediary's sales representatives.
In addition to salespersons who call upon the intermediary's sales representatives, a Full-Service Underwriter often will provide so-called internal wholesalers, who provide back-up sales support by staffing phones and responding to requests from each intermediary's sales representatives.
�
�







18


As was the case in the Benchmark Application, the distribution agreement with the Fund Company does not specifically preclude the Distributor from soliciting purchases of shares of the Portfolios.��The distribution agreement also provides that the Distributor will use efforts deemed appropriate by the Distributor to solicit orders for shares and will undertake promotion or advertising as requested by the Portfolios.��However, Applicants do not interpret the distribution agreement as imposing any requirement on the Distributor to locate investors for the Portfolios.



�


� 


- 29 -





� 


A Full-Service Underwriter is typically a dedicated business unit that is an affiliated person of the fund adviser.��Thus, Full-Service Underwriters are directly involved with the sales and promotion of the fund's shares.
In contrast, a Limited-Purpose Underwriter plays no role in promoting the funds to retail or institutional customers, and does not employ sales personnel.��Instead, when a fund contracts with a Limited-Purpose Underwriter, the funds' investment adviser is responsible for marketing fund shares to investors and Intermediaries.��Because the activities of the employees of the adviser would require that these persons be associated persons of a registered broker-dealer, these individuals are associated persons of, and are supervised by, the funds' Limited-Purpose Underwriter with respect to compliance with FINRA requirements and applicable laws and regulations.��However, the Limited-Purpose Underwriter is not responsible for controlling or directing the sales activities of these associated persons.
As a Limited-Purpose Underwriter, BNY Mellon is consequently not in a position vis-�-vis the Portfolios to perpetrate the type of abuse that Section 17(a) was designed to prevent.��As described below, these concerns exist with respect to Full-Service Underwriters, who are in a position to abuse the power they possess over funds due to their role as the focal point for the purchase and sale of funds' shares.��The Applicants believe that these policy concerns do not exist with respect to Limited-Purpose Underwriters, such as the Distributor, whose role in the sale of funds' shares is limited to regulatory compliance and administrative matters.

BNY Mellon Does Not Control Fund Investment
Decisions



�
Neither BNY Mellon nor, as discussed in greater detail below, its officers and employees are in any position to control or influence the investment activities of any Portfolio of the Fund Company.��Investment decisions for each of the Portfolios are made exclusively by the investment adviser to the Portfolio, or its Sub-Advisers, which are unaffiliated with BNY Mellon.��The Fund Company has entered into an investment advisory contract with BIM to act as investment adviser to the Portfolios.��It is not the intent of the Fund Company to also engage BNY Mellon as an investment adviser for any Portfolio relying on this Application.
�
BNY Mellon does not play any role in determining which categories of securities or specific securities are purchased or sold by the Portfolios, or the counterparty to any Portfolio, in any securities lending transaction.��There is no express or implied understanding that BIM will cause any of the Portfolios to enter into purchase or sale transactions with BNY Mellon, and neither the Portfolios nor BIM would give any preference to BNY Mellon as a broker or dealer when effecting purchase or sale transactions for the Portfolios or securities lending transactions for the Portfolios.
�
Given this lack of any influence or control, there is no policy reason for precluding the Portfolios from engaging in transactions with BNY Mellon.19��As stated by the staff in a 1995 no-action letter to Salomon Brothers concerning whether to apply the so-called "collapsing entity" doctrine to treat Salomon Brothers and an advisory affiliate as a single entity:
�
�







19


The Commission has noted that Section 17(a) is intended primarily to proscribe "a purchase or sale transaction when a party to the transaction has both the ability and the pecuniary incentive to influence the actions of the investment company." See Investment Company Act Release No. 10886 (Oct. 2, 1979), citing Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580 Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., at 256�259 (1940).��Applicants submit that the Distributor has neither the ability nor the incentive to influence the actions of the Funds.



�


� 


- 31 -





� 


�
Moreover, we agree that, under the circumstances presented, there do not appear to be any policy reasons that would require that Salomon and the Salomon entities be treated as a single entity.��Section 17 was intended to prevent insiders from using an investment company to benefit themselves to the detriment of the company and its shareholders.��You represent that, because Salomon will engage in principal transactions with funds and portfolios that are advised by persons not affiliated with Salomon or any Salomon Adviser, Salomon will not be in a position to cause these funds and portfolios to engage in the Proposed Transactions.20
�
Although the foregoing statement was made in a slightly different context, Applicants submit that the same policy applies equally to the instant situation.21

BNY Mellon's Officers and Employees Play No
Role in Investment Decisions



�
Although BNY Mellon's officers and employees serve as officers of the Fund Company, none of those persons are employed or otherwise affiliated with the Portfolios' investment adviser or Sub-Advisers, serve as directors of the Fund Company, or participate in any aspect of the adviser's or Sub-Advisers' selection of investments, broker-dealers, or securities lending counterparty, or the purchase and sale of securities.
None of BNY Mellon's officers or employees are responsible for the formulation or establishment of the Portfolios' investment objectives, policies, or restrictions.��The officers and employees function only as administrative officers of the Fund Company, handling administrative tasks necessary to maintain the Fund Company as a going concern, such as preparing the agendas and minutes of board meetings, drafting correspondence, signing routine regulatory filings, and supervising as needed recordkeeping and accounting.��The performance of these functions by BNY Mellon's personnel does not result in any opportunity for underwriter control of the Portfolios and/or Fund Company.��We note that the Federal Reserve reached this very conclusion, albeit in a somewhat different statutory context.��In approving a bank's acquisition of a fund administrator, the Federal Reserve wrote: "permitting a bank holding company .�.�.�to provide the
essentially ministerial or supporting functions as administrator to (a) fund would not significantly increase the ability of the bank holding company to control the mutual fund."22

The Commission subsequently codified this position by adopting Rule 17a-10 and by amending Rule 10f-3, both under the Investment Company Act.��See Transactions of Investment Companies with Portfolio and Subadviser Affiliates, Investment Company Act Release No. 25888 (Adopting Release, January 14, 2003); Investment Company Act Release No. 25557 (Proposing Release, April 30, 2002).

meetings, drafting correspondence, signing routine regulatory filings, and supervising as needed recordkeeping and accounting.��The performance of these functions by BNY Mellon's personnel does not result in any opportunity for underwriter control of the Portfolios and/or Fund Company.��We note that the Federal Reserve reached this very conclusion, albeit in a somewhat different statutory context.��In approving a bank's acquisition of a fund administrator, the Federal Reserve wrote: "permitting a bank holding company .�.�.�to provide the essentially ministerial or supporting functions as administrator to (a) fund would not significantly increase the ability of the bank holding company to control the mutual fund."�
The policy-making functions of the Fund Company rest with their independent board of directors, which has been and will continue to be responsible for the selection and review of the major contractors to the Fund Company, including the advisers and the underwriter.��BNY Mellon's officers and employees do not and will not serve as members of the Fund Company's board of directors and consequently will not be engaged in considering and approving the Fund Company's advisory and distribution arrangements.
�




�

Additional Fund Services do not Result in BNY
Mellon's Control of Fund Investment Decisions



�
BNY Mellon, through its affiliated persons, provides certain fund services ("Additional Services") to the Portfolios,23 but the Additional Services do not increase BNY Mellon's power or ability to influence the Portfolios or the Portfolios' independent adviser and the Sub-Advisers.��This conclusion is supported by the fact that their status as providers of Additional Services does not: (i) place these BNY Mellon service providers within the provisions of Section 17 of the Investment Company Act: (ii) make these service providers "affiliated persons" of the Funds as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act; or (iii) subject the service providers to a fiduciary duty under Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act.
�











23


BNY Mellon or its affiliated persons serve as fund administrator, accounting agent, transfer agent, or custodian.
�





� 


- 33 -





� 



The Portfolios' adviser, BIM, and the Sub-Advisers have no incentive to benefit BNY Mellon, and faces strong incentives to direct Transactions to BNY Mellon only when the adviser and/or the Sub-Advisers believe the Transactions are in the Portfolios' best interests.��Moreover, there is vigorous competition in the fund services industry among BNY Mellon and its competitors to provide Limited-Purpose Underwriter services, fund administration services and the Additional Services.��If the services provided by BNY Mellon to a Fund are not priced competitively, BIM or the other advisers have every incentive to negotiate lower prices and/or change service providers.
BIM and the Sub-Advisers are unaffiliated with BNY Mellon and lack any incentive to disadvantage the Portfolios simply to benefit BNY Mellon.��In fact, BIM and the Sub-Advisers have a strong incentive to see that the Portfolios are not overreached by the Distributor or the Additional Services providers, in order to enhance each Portfolio's respective investment performance.��Enhanced performance may lead to asset growth for the Portfolios, which may result in greater advisory fees to BIM and the Sub-Advisers because they are compensated based upon the Portfolios' assets under management.
The fund services business in which the BNY Mellon Additional Services providers compete consists of very large and well-financed institutions that provide a similar suite of services to fund families.��The fund services industry is a competitive industry, and this competition effectively prevents fund services providers from obtaining heightened power or ability to influence the Portfolios or the Portfolio's adviser or Sub-Advisers.

�


� 


- 34 -





� 


The facts described above demonstrate that BNY Mellon's provision of Limited- Purpose Underwriting services, together with the Additional Services, does not heighten BNY Mellon's power or ability to influence the Portfolios or the Portfolios' adviser.
�




� 


2.


The Ability to Engage in Principal Transactions with BNY
Mellon Would Benefit the Funds



�
Because the Transactions would not implicate any of the concerns that led to the enactment of Section 17(a), the inability of the Portfolios to engage in the Transactions does not serve the Fund Company's or its Portfolios' best interests.��By applying the Section 17(a) restriction to Transactions with BNY Mellon after the Stock Sale, the Portfolios may be prevented from effecting transactions on the most favorable terms for the Portfolios and with the least amount of administrative burdens.
As described above, certain types of FX Transactions are typically directed to a fund's Custodial Service Provider due to compelling factors including cost, administrative convenience, and resources and expertise.��If the Portfolios cannot engage BNY Mellon, as principal to effect an FX Transaction, the Portfolios may be disadvantaged, for the reasons discussed in Section II above.
�


� 


- 35 -





� 


In the case of the derivative transactions and other principal transactions described in Section II above, Applicants submit that BIM should not be foreclosed from engaging, on behalf of the Portfolios, in such Transactions with BNY Mellon as principal, where Section 17(a)'s policy concerns are not implicated, and (i) an independent party, with a vested interested in Portfolio performance, is making all investment decisions for the Portfolio; and (ii) the Fund Company and its Portfolios are in no way dependent on the distribution services of BNY Mellon.
�
B.�����������Section 10(f)
�
To the extent that an affiliated person of a BNY Mellon entity that provides underwriting services to issuers serves as an officer of the Portfolios, under Section 10(f), the Portfolios would be restricted from acquiring securities from BNY Mellon during the securities' underwriting or syndication period.��Unlike Section 17(a), which at least nominally applies to transactions with the principal underwriter of an investment company, the only reason that Section 10(f) would apply is because officers of the Fund Company are affiliated persons of the BNY Mellon entity that participates in the underwriting.��Section 10(f) applies to any person "of which" an officer of a fund is an affiliated person.��Yet the reason for applying this prohibition to officers of the Fund Company � the control and influence that an officer may have over the investment decisions of a Portfolio � simply does not apply.��Fund Company officers employed
by BNY Mellon perform purely administrative, non-advisory functions.��Nonetheless, the Fund Company and its Portfolios would be deprived of full access to the securities of which BNY Mellon is an underwriter.��As described in detail above in connection with Section 17(a), BNY Mellon exercises no control or influence over the investment decisions or policies of the Portfolios, and it is not in a position to exert pressure on the Portfolios to buy securities that it is underwriting.
�


� 


- 36 -





� 


�
V.�����������PROPOSED CONDITIONS
�
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
�
1.�����������The Distributor will provide only the services of a Limited-Purpose Underwriter to any Fund relying on the Order.
�
2.�����������Personnel of the Distributor and of each BNY Mellon entity that provides administrative, transfer agency, fund accounting, or custody services to a Fund will not directly or indirectly consult with any Fund's adviser, sub-adviser(s) or any portfolio manager of the adviser or sub-adviser(s) concerning securities purchases or sales or the selection of a broker or dealer for any transaction placed or to be placed on behalf of a Fund, or otherwise seek to influence such purchases or sales or the choice of broker or dealer for any transaction by a Fund.��Such services providers will adopt compliance policies and procedures designed to assure compliance with this condition.
�
3.�����������Each Fund's board, including a majority of its disinterested directors/trustees, shall approve, and the Fund shall implement, compliance policies and procedures governing all Transactions pursuant to the Order.��Such policies and procedures shall require that the board receive at each regularly scheduled quarterly meeting a report by the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, which reviews Transactions effected during the previous quarter and confirms that the conditions of the Order have been satisfied.
�


� 


- 37 -





� 



������������
������������ 4.�����������Neither BNY Mellon nor its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a Fund for which BNY Mellon or any of its affiliated persons act as investment adviser or sub-adviser except to the extent permitted by an exemptive order separate from the Order or by statute, rule, or no-action letter.
������������ 5.�����������BNY Mellon and its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a Fund in reliance on the Order only if neither BNY Mellon nor any affiliated person of BNY Mellon is (i) affiliated with any investment adviser or sub-adviser to the series, or (ii) responsible for the selection of particular securities to be acquired for the series, or (iii) responsible for the selection of any particular broker-dealer or other counterparty for transactions effected by the series.
����������� 6.�����������BNY Mellon and its affiliated persons will engage in principal transactions with any series of a Fund in reliance on the Order only if no affiliated person of BNY Mellon serves as a director of the Fund.
����������� 7.�����������Each Transaction between BNY Mellon or its affiliated persons and a Fund made in reliance on the Order will be effected only in an arm's-length transaction with the Fund, acting through its investment adviser, sub-adviser(s) or other person unaffiliated with BNY Mellon, and will be consistent with the policy of the Fund.

� 


On the basis of the foregoing, Applicants submit that the terms and conditions set forth herein are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person; that they are consistent with the policy of the Fund Company and its Portfolios; that they are consistent with the general purposes of the Investment Company Act, in general, and Sections 17(a) and 10(f), in particular; and that the requested exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Investment Company Act.
�
VI.�����������PRECEDENT
�
The requested relief is substantially similar to relief previously granted by the Commission.��See, e.g., The Benchmark Funds, Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 22882 (November 12, 1997) (notice) and 22929 (December 9, 1997) (order).��In addition, analogous relief from the provisions of Section 17(a) has been granted by the Commission to allow certain series or portfolios of investment companies to engage in principal transactions in the ordinary course of business with securities dealers that may be deemed to be affiliated persons of affiliated persons of the investment companies solely because of the investment companies' downstream affiliation (i.e., through ownership of 5 percent or more) with a fund, which has an adviser that is under
common control with the securities dealers, see, Goldman Sachs & Co., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 25466 (March 19, 2002) (order) and 25424 (February 20, 2002) (notice), and because of a sub-advisory relationship with one or more of those investment companies' series or portfolios��See, e.g., Hercules Funds��Inc., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 21144 (June 19, 1995) (notice) and 21207 (July 18, 1995) (order); Goldman, Sachs & Co., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 19709 (Sept. 14, 1993) (notice) and 19786 (Oct. 13, 1993) (order); State
Street Bank and Trust Co., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 19784 (Oct. 13, 1993) (notice) and 19844 (Nov. 9, 1993) (order); North American Security Trust, Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 18860 (July 22, 1992) (notice) and 18899 (Aug. 18, 1992) (order).
