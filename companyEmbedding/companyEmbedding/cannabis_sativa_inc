Judge Jim GrayIndependent Director
Judge Jim GrayIndependent DirectorCited on numerous occasions for his work in the areas of both social reform and civic philanthropy, Judge James P. Gray currently presides over the civil trial calendar for the Superior Court of Orange County.Judge Gray was appointed to the Santa Ana Municipal Court in 1983 by Governor George Deukmejian, and in 1989, Deukmejian elevated Gray to his post with the Superior Court.Throughout his 29-year career within the legal and judicial community, Jim Gray has not only donated hundreds of hours of volunteer time to existing community service-oriented activities, he also has created and implemented a number of innovative programs of his own, each one a success story in itself.For instance, it was Jim Gray who introduced Orange County to the Peer Court System, where juvenile defendants travel to a school outside their district to have their actual cases tried by other teenagers.Gray, who also has worked closely with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, helped form a MADDDUI panel in 1987 whereby defendants were made to listen as victims of drunk driving told their heartbreaking stories. This program is ongoing and has been recognized as one of the most effective within the MADD organization and the court system. Along these lines, as a member of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Program’s Drinking Driving Program Advisory Committee, he recommended treatment programs to combat the DUI problem. To that end, he helped establish a program whereby youthful offenders of drunk driving laws were sentenced to visit the Western Medical Trauma Center. Still today, these youngsters are made to witness the devastating injuries of drunk driving victims. This program is also cosponsored by the Volunteer Center of Orange County, where Gray has served as a board member.Other such related efforts include his work as a co-founder of “Drive Alive” — along with the Orange County Health Care Agency and MADD — a promotional publicity campaign for students who were invited to compete in writing Public Service Announcements to deter their fellow teens from drunk driving. Students, who win prizes for their efforts, also produced bumper stickers and other promotional materials aimed at the same theme.Other civic contributions include his work with the “Stay In School” program at both Willard Intermediate and Santa Ana High Schools. Not long ago, Gray was also lauded for his contributions as a co-founder of BLAST (Bert Bylevens Leagues, After School Time) — a program providing children with after school athletics and recreation through the Garden Grove School District, the Garden Grove Police Department, the Orange County Probation Department, and the ministry of the Crystal Cathedral.Other organizations Judge Jim Gray has helped to found include: the Association of Former U.S. Attorneys, which is a group that meets yearly to share ideas and present keynote speakers; and the William P. Gray / Legion Lex Inn of Court in conjunction with USC Law School, which was founded to increase ethics, education, and professionalism for judges and lawyers.The son of a highly regarded federal judge, “Judge William P. Gray“, Gray was raised in the Los Angeles area and attended schools in both La Canada and Pasadena. He received his undergraduate degree from UCLA in 1966 and a Juris Doctor from USC in 1971.Gray served in the Peace Corps in Costa Rica for two years and also served as a staff judge advocate and criminal defense attorney for the U.S. Navy JAG Corps in both Guam and Lemore, California. He was awarded a National Defense Ribbon, a Vietnam Service Ribbon, and a Combat Action Ribbon during his tour of duty. He also worked as a federal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles, where he received numerous letters of commendation from federal agencies, and in private practice in civil litigation in Newport Beach for five years.Judge Jim Gray has won a host of awards over the years, including “Judge of the Year” in 1992 from the Business Litigation Section of the Orange County Bar Association, and in 1995, was given that same honor by the Orange County Constitutional Rights Foundation. He has also received the Drug Policy Foundation’s prestigious “Justice Gerald Le Dain Award” for achievements in the field of law.Gray has also received letters of commendation from the Orange County Board of Supervisors for his creation of a successful drinking-driver sentencing program, and from the Judge Advocate General of the Navy for his work in handling claims resulting from a Medivac airplane crash in the Marshall Islands.Additionally, Judge Jim Gray has been a member of the California Judicial Council, as well as the California Judicial Council’s Advisory Committee on Juvenile Law, the Alcohol Advisory Board to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, the Advisory Board of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, the Republican Finance Committee of Orange County, and the Orange County Law Library. He has also been a member of the Board of Councilors of the USC Law School.Although Judge Jim Gray has championed many causes, none has been more bold than his work to combat the illegal drug problem in America. Gray continues to mobilize civic leaders, government officials, corporations, non-profit organizations, the media, and the public around the country to join him in exploring alternate solutions to reduce this chronic problem.In addition to his ongoing civic activities and philanthropic work, Jim Gray has been an adjunct professor at Chapman University, the College of Trial Advocacy for new Orange County attorneys, and the Continuing Legal Education of the Bar.Judge Jim Gray is married to Grace Walker Gray and has 4 children, Bill, Jennifer, Morgan and Ky, the latter of Vietnamese descent whom Gray adopted as a 13-month old. Gray lives in Newport Beach, California, and is a member of the Garden Grove Methodist Church.Profile detailsCategories:Board Member, TeamComments:0Like:7

Cannabis Sativa Hi Products Featured In LA Times Article Regarding Cannabis Trademarks And Branding04On January 9, 2017January 9, 2017In Press Release, UncategorizedTags branding, cannabis sativa inc, Hi Brands International, LA Times, OTCQB:CBDS, patent, press release, trademarkMESQUITE, NV / ACCESSWIRE / January 9, 2017 / Cannabis Sativa, Inc. (CBDS) announces that its hi product line was featured in the Los Angeles Times business section in an article detailing trademarking and branding issues in the cannabis industry, on January 7, 2017. The link below leads to the article by James Koren and photo by Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times:http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-marijuana-trademarks-20170104-story.htmlThe story showcases the hi product line and the current United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) stance that although cannabis is widely being legalized by states, it is still federally illegal, thereby precluding trademark registration for cannabis products. The article covers the tactic of cannabis companies trademarking ancillary products as the only course they can take to protect their intellectual property (IP).The USPTOs stance on cannabis trademarks appears to differ somewhat from their stance on cannabis patents. On December 20, 2016, Cannabis Sativa was awarded Patent PP27,475 fora Cannabis Plant. The plant, Ecuadorian Sativa, is also known as CTA. This is one of the few cannabis strains allowed by the USPTO and was the result of seven years of legal effort. The Company plans to market or license the patented strain using the names Ecuadorian Sativa and CTA. The stance of the USPTO on whether Cannabis Sativa will be awarded the trademark Ecuadorian Sativa or CTA, or whether it is implied in the patent is the quandary.“We would hope that the USPTO recognizes Cannabis Sativa’s ownership of the Equadorian Sativa and CTA names, as they appear to be implicitly granted in the patent”, Tobias said. As stated in Koren’s article, “The goal of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion, and different companies can use the same name for products as long as their products are in different categories and wouldn’t cause confusion”, and that “trademark protection can apply not only to products a company makes now, but to products that a company might reasonably be expected to make later on — what trademark lawyers call the zone of natural expansion”. We are hopeful that industry awareness and articles such as Mr. Koren’s will help shift the USPTO’s stands on the issuance of trademarks for cannabis related products.Cannabis Sativa has been active in pursuing IP and has successfully acquired a growing portfolio of Intellectual Property.Forward-Looking Statements:This press release contains “forward-looking statements.” Although the forward-looking statements in this release reflect the good faith judgment of management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.

Cannabis Sativa, Inc. Awarded US Patent for “Ecuadorian Sativa” Cannabis Plant (aka CTA)08On December 21, 2016December 21, 2016In Company News, Press ReleaseTags Cannabis, cannabis sativa, cannabis sativa inc, CBDS, CTA, ecuadorian sativa, OTCQB:CBDS, patentCannabis Sativa, Inc. Awarded US Patent for Ecuadorian Sativa Cannabis Plant (aka CTA) MESQUITE, NV / ACCESSWIRE / December 21, 2016 / Cannabis Sativa, Inc. (OTCQB: CBDS) announced that on December 20, 2016, the company’s subsidiary was awarded Patent PP27,475 for a Cannabis Plant named Ecuadorian Sativa and deemed “CTA”.Equadorian Sativa has been shown in laboratory testing by Steephill Labs to have a Limonene level that is extraordinarily high at a level of 4.53, 10 to 20 times the usual range. This sets Equadorian Sativa apart from other varieties in its odor, the effects on mood and mentation and its medical qualities.The objective of the breeding, which produced this novel plant strain, was primarily to develop a plant having the following characteristics: (a) medicinal properties that included hypotensive activity; (b) psychoactive properties that motivated and energized, rather than creating lethargy, sleepiness, and (c) increased food consumption.Anecdotally, there are indications that its use may prevent some cancers and may cause apoptosis of cancer cells in vivo. There is a good possibility that the high levels of limonene may slow down the build-up of plaque in the arteries and reduce the effect of low-density lipo-proteins on the circulatory system. Indications are that Ecuadorian Sativa has many medical qualities that make it an important tool to maintain health and deal with illness.“Our patience is now rewarded with the issuance of Patent PP27,475”. “This patent will open up new areas for research and opportunities for CBDS”, said CEO Mike Gravel.This plant was derived from a female said to be of a strain called colloquially, “Celestial Temple Sativa” an individual grown in Ecuador that as a solitary plant reached a height of 23 feet. The male parent is said to have been of a strain known colloquially as “Island Sweet Skunk”.The Company’s President David Tobias said, ”This is a major accomplishment and is a tribute to the foresight and perseverance of management to solidify Cannabis Sativa’s contribution to the maturing Cannabis industry.Forward-Looking Statements:This press release contains “forward-looking statements.” Although the forward-looking statements in this release reflect the good faith judgment of management, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.

Marijuana brands can trademark almost anything, except marijuana - LA Times

Marijuana brands can trademark almost anything, except marijuana

James Rufus KorenContact Reporter




Hi is a cannabis brand. Its logo — “hi” in white letters inside an orange circle — can be found above the front door of a Portland, Ore., marijuana shop and on a handful of cannabis products, including massage oil and Hi Releaf pain-relief balm.But you wouldn’t guess any of that from Hi’s trademark filings. In 2015, the brand’s parent company, Cannabis Sativa Inc., filed a trademark application — not for any of Hi’s core products, but for hats, T-shirts and a wide array of other apparel.If the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office signs off on the application, Cannabis Sativa would be able to stop other companies from using the Hi brand on clothing, but it might not be able to stop rivals from setting up Hi-brand marijuana shops or selling knockoff Hi-brand products.This is the odd state of affairs for trademark protection in the cannabis industry, one of the many byproducts of the gap between state and federal marijuana laws.







Though cannabis is legal for recreational or medicinal use in 28 states, it remains illegal under federal law. As a result, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will not register trademarks for marijuana retailers or for products that contain cannabis.“You want to protect what you’re doing with the brand name,” said David Tobias, president of publicly traded Cannabis Sativa, “but you have to dance around it.”One popular strategy for cannabis companies that can’t trademark their core products is to seek protection for a host of ancillary products and services.“I call it the ‘circle the wagons’ approach,” said Todd Winter, a Costa Mesa attorney who works with marijuana companies. “We get everything trademarked that we can, tangential to the actual cannabis product itself.”

The idea, one that is largely untested so far, is that if a cannabis company registers its trademark for other products it will scare off would-be copycats and allow the company to be first in line if the federal government eases its stance on pot.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is leading an effort to make sure vendors working... (Associated Press)

Cannabis Sativa applied for an apparel trademark and hopes to put its Hi brand on other products, including lozenges for smokers.Stoner comedian Tommy Chong’s brand, Chong’s Choice, which sells a line of pre-rolled marijuana cigarettes, has applied for a trademark for vaporizers and “tobacco” jars.Altai, a brand of cannabis chocolates, is seeking trademark protection for its name brand as a provider of information about medical cannabis.Mary Shapiro, a San Francisco attorney, said the goal is to get something federally trademarked — and the more closely related to marijuana, the better. She is working with Salinas firm Indus Holdings, Altai’s parent company, on its trademark application.Once a company has even applied to register a trademark, it’s noted in a federal database. When companies set out to submit trademark applications of their own, they search that database to see if their brand name is already in use — and if so, how it’s being used.The goal of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion, and different companies can use the same name for products as long as their products are in different categories and wouldn’t cause confusion.The Patent and Trademark Office would likely reject a trademark application for a soap brand with a name similar to Unilever’s Dove, but it didn’t stop candy company Mars from trademarking Dove-brand chocolate.The same rules apply in the cannabis industry, but it’s tricky. Unilever can make clear in its trademark application that Dove makes soap, which lets other companies know they shouldn’t try applying for a similar trademark for soap-related products.Cannabis companies, however, have to be more circumspect, hoping that a trademark for rolling papers or providing cannabis information will be enough of a hint that a company has laid claim to a cannabis-related trademark.“It raises a red flag that there’s a company already operating in the space,” Shapiro said. “Basically, it's a warning sign that someone else has claimed rights to the name in connection to cannabis.”Along with scaring off potential competitors, there’s another potential benefit: If the Patent and Trademark Office were to start approving trademarks for cannabis products, companies with cannabis-related marks could be first in line.Going back to that notion of preventing confusion, trademark protection can apply not only to products a company makes now, but to products that a company might reasonably be expected to make later on — what trademark lawyers call the zone of natural expansion.Even before Unilever started making Dove-brand shampoo, it would have been hard for another firm to trademark that name, as consumers might reasonably expect Dove soap and shampoo to come from the same company.That’s why Winter is helping one of his clients, Arizona cannabis candy company Baked Bros, apply for a trademark on syrups and gummy candies that contain CBD, a hemp extract that’s available nationwide. The Patent and Trademark office has approved trademarks for other products containing CBD.Winter said CBD is about as close to marijuana as the trademark office will go. If the office approves Bake Bros’ application, Winter said he believes marijuana products would be within the company’s zone of expansion.“From a legal standpoint, if you have a hemp-based product under your brand, no one will be able to get a cannabis-related trademark for a similar brand,” he said.Still, the“circle the wagons” strategy isn’t foolproof, and it comes with challenges of its own. To get and keep a trademark, companies actually have to use it.To maintain its “hi” clothing trademark, Cannabis Sativa will actually have to sell some clothes. They’re not widely available for now, though Hal Lewis, the company’s national sales manager, said he plans to launch an online store this year. Chong’s Choice will have to  keep selling jars and vaporizers, which are available online and at marijuana shops in a few states.That represents a threat for cannabis brands. If customers love a company’s weed but not its other products, the company could lose its trademark altogether, said Alison Malsbury, another attorney who specializes in cannabis trademarks.“The Patent and Trademark Office is looking for more than just token sales,” she said. “If you’re not continually using the trademark, it can be canceled and you can lose everything.”What’s more, she and other attorneys note that the strategy cannabis companies are using remains untested. Unless and until the federal government decides to allow cannabis trademarks, companies can’t be sure their cannabis-adjacent trademarks will be able to carry over to pot products. And so far, there’s been little legal squabbling between cannabis companies, meaning there’s not much precedent for companies to rely on.

“We don't really have any test cases,” Malsbury said.But that could change as the cannabis industry continues to grow. Winter suspects disputes between cannabis companies have been rare in part because the industry is tightknit.As money floods in and competition heats up, he expects companies to develop sharper elbows.“There's a fair amount of peer pressure within the industry to not use someone else’s brand,” he said. “But that's changing a little with the dynamic of multimillionaires and billionaires investing in the industry.”
