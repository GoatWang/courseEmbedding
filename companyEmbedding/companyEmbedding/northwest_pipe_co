Industries & Markets
Transporting water over hundreds of miles, our steel water pipe is made to last for the many applications for which it is designed and manufactured. The municipal market for water where steel pipe is widely used includes water transmission, low pressure / gravity flows, trenchless technology applications, rehabilitation and renewal, and plant piping for water and wastewater treatment plants.
126-inch Polyurethane Lined & Coated AWWA C200 Steel Water Pipe, Provo Reservoir Canal Enclosure Project, Utah
Solutions for the Needs of the Water Market – Northwest Pipe Company caters to the needs of the water and wastewater markets by supplying fully engineered steel water pipe for water transmission and distribution, gravity applications such as sanitary sewers and storm water lines, low pressure applications such as sewer force mains, as well as the piping needs of water and wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations.
For large-scale transport of water and wastewater, we are the largest providers of spiral-welded steel water pipe, rolled-and-welded straight seam pipe, and custom fabricated pipe in North America. These options come with numerous types of linings and coatings, joint connection alternatives to suit the application, and professional support that extends from engineering through construction and installation.
Steel Pipe for Trenchless Technology and Pipeline Renewal – We contribute to the continued growth of the trenchless technology market by manufacturing steel piping products for both jacking as well as pull-in applications. Permalok® Steel Casing Pipe provides a proprietary joint that eliminates the need to perform field butt-welding of traditional casing pipe, increasing construction productivity that results in substantial savings to the Contractor and the Owner.
Since the mid-1980’s, Northwest Pipe Company has worked with municipalities to pioneer the rehabilitation of large diameter prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) using steel Reliners and Slipliners, a need that continues to grow exponentially. The fully structural lining of PCCP with steel is performed both in potable water transmission systems as well as cooling water systems in thermoelectric power plants.
Energy Market – The hydroelectric energy market uses steel penstock pipes and liners along with bifurcations, trifurcations, fittings and other fabricated components for both buried and above-ground service. We supply all pipe and fittings components of a hydropower system to customers throughout the United States and Canada.
For the thermoelectric power plant market, whether the energy source is nuclear, coal, natural gas or oil, steel pipes are specified to transport water between cooling towers and condenser heat exchangers, a critical application which must be served with reliable piping materials not prone to premature failures. Losses in valuable production time in power plants can result in substantial financial losses to energy companies. Steel has proven to be that reliable material time and time again.
Industrial Applications – The industrial market for steel pipe includes high and low pressure air piping and steam exhaust pipe used in manufacturing, wash water pipelines, sludge and trailing lines and slurry pipe used in mining and quarrying, compressed air lines and condensate piping used in paper and wood mills, aerial, underwater and bridge crossings and ventilating lines used in construction, pilings, columns and casing used in structural applications, and surface and underground piping and gravity spouts and blowpipe for grain handling pipe used in agriculture, amongst a host of other applications including fire protection.

Solutions for the Needs of the Water Market – Northwest Pipe Company caters to the needs of the water and wastewater markets by supplying fully engineered steel water pipe for water transmission and distribution, gravity applications such as sanitary sewers and storm water lines, low pressure applications such as sewer force mains, as well as the piping needs of water and wastewater treatment plants and pumping stations.
For large-scale transport of water and wastewater, we are the largest providers of spiral-welded steel water pipe, rolled-and-welded straight seam pipe, and custom fabricated pipe in North America. These options come with numerous types of linings and coatings, joint connection alternatives to suit the application, and professional support that extends from engineering through construction and installation.
Steel Pipe for Trenchless Technology and Pipeline Renewal – We contribute to the continued growth of the trenchless technology market by manufacturing steel piping products for both jacking as well as pull-in applications. Permalok® Steel Casing Pipe provides a proprietary joint that eliminates the need to perform field butt-welding of traditional casing pipe, increasing construction productivity that results in substantial savings to the Contractor and the Owner.
Since the mid-1980’s, Northwest Pipe Company has worked with municipalities to pioneer the rehabilitation of large diameter prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) using steel Reliners and Slipliners, a need that continues to grow exponentially. The fully structural lining of PCCP with steel is performed both in potable water transmission systems as well as cooling water systems in thermoelectric power plants.
Energy Market – The hydroelectric energy market uses steel penstock pipes and liners along with bifurcations, trifurcations, fittings and other fabricated components for both buried and above-ground service. We supply all pipe and fittings components of a hydropower system to customers throughout the United States and Canada.
For the thermoelectric power plant market, whether the energy source is nuclear, coal, natural gas or oil, steel pipes are specified to transport water between cooling towers and condenser heat exchangers, a critical application which must be served with reliable piping materials not prone to premature failures. Losses in valuable production time in power plants can result in substantial financial losses to energy companies. Steel has proven to be that reliable material time and time again.
Industrial Applications – The industrial market for steel pipe includes high and low pressure air piping and steam exhaust pipe used in manufacturing, wash water pipelines, sludge and trailing lines and slurry pipe used in mining and quarrying, compressed air lines and condensate piping used in paper and wood mills, aerial, underwater and bridge crossings and ventilating lines used in construction, pilings, columns and casing used in structural applications, and surface and underground piping and gravity spouts and blowpipe for grain handling pipe used in agriculture, amongst a host of other applications including fire protection.

The Houston mill, which has traditionally produced only mechanical tubing products, began to produce green tube for OCTG in 2010. The mill upgrade will build on the OCTG green tube and other products already being produced on-site by adding production of 2 3/8 and 2 7/8 inch tubing with physical properties suitable for heat treating."We believe the Houston mill expansion represents an attractive growth opportunity for our Tubular Products business," said Rich Roman, CEO Northwest Pipe Company.About Northwest Pipe Company's Tubular Products Group Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, Northwest Pipe Company's Tubular Products Group operates three ERW (Electric Resistance Weld) mill facilities in the United States.

The company makes welded-steel water transmission lines that form the circulatory systems of water suppliers. Its transmission pipes are made to transport water under pressure and sold primarily to water utilities. Northwest Pipe also makes tubular products from 1.5 inches to 16 inches in diameter for the construction, – more... agriculture, and energy markets. The Water Transmission Group is a top supplier of high pressure, highly engineered steel pipe products. The Tubular Products Group operates three technologically-advanced Electric Resistance Weld mill facilities. The Fabricated Products segment fabricates pressure vessels, tanks, steel pipe, and miscellaneous metals products.Geographic ReachThe company's Water Transmission division has manufacturing facilities in six US states and in Mexico, and its Tubular Products unit has manufacturing sites in three US locations.Sales and MarketingNorthwest Pipe markets its water infrastructure and tubular products products through an in-house sales force (a network of direct sales personnel in the US and Canada). It focuses its marketing on quality, customer service, and customer relationships. Most of the unit's products are sold to distributors, although some are sold to OEMs.Financial AnalysisThe company's revenue grew by 32% in 2011 due to a 23% increase in net sales thanks to a 3% rise in tons produced and a 19% increase in the selling price per ton. The increase in selling price per ton was due to higher steel prices and a more effective mix of contracts. Northwest Pipe reported a 45% increase in Tubular Products sales due to a 29% increase in tons sold and a 14% increase in the average selling price per ton.Net income increased by 332% in 2011 due to higher revenues and a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses driven by insurance proceeds received related to the company's  accounting investigation. (Due to errors in reporting its net income for 2005 through 2007, Northwest Pipe restated its earnings in 2010. The company reported a reduction of some $17 million in net income for 2005-06, and made adjustments to several other years. The accounting problems at the company resulted in a number of shareholder lawsuits).Except for a revenue slump in 2009 the company saw an upward trend in revenues from 2007 to 2011. The slump in 2009 is attributable to a decrease in tons produced and a drop in the selling price per ton because of the global recession. The decrease in volumes was due to reduced demand for production of industrial and municipal water transmission projects whereas the decrease in selling price per ton was due to more aggressive bidding activity, resulting from reduced demand in 2009, as well as from a decline in steel prices.StrategyNorthwest Pipe works closely with public water agencies, contractors, and engineering firms, usually years in advance of the projects for which it bids. Its Water Transmission unit is therefore able to evaluate planned projects at early stages and promote the specifications and advantages of its own systems. The company usually submits its bids to installation contractors, who include its bids in their proposals to public water agencies. In 2012 Northwest Pipe announced plans to expand its Saginaw, Texas manufacturing facility. The expansion enables the company to better serve the needs of anticipated large water projects in the area. Completion of the Saginaw expansion will allow the company to leverage its proximity to Tarrant Regional Water District's planned Integrated Pipeline Project and give it expanded capabilities to serve additional water projects in the region.OwnershipEagle Asset Management, Inc. owns 15% of the company.Company BackgroundNorthwest Pipe was founded in 1966. – lessReviewsFeatured Review1st QA experienceContract Certified Welding Inspector, Denver, CO - June 28, 2017Great QA department that has since be replace due to whatever the entire department is gone which was highly qualified.
