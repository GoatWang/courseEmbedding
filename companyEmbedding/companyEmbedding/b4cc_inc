The Hot Stock: HP Inc. Climbs 2.7%

 HP Inc. (HPQ) rose to the top of the S&P 500 Wednesday. 







            Illustration: 
          
          Agence France-Presse/Getty Images
        



 The shares climbed 48 cents, or 2.7%, to $18.02, compared to the S&P 500, which lost 8.85 points, or 0.38%, to 2344.93. HP was helped by data from IDC that showed the firm regained the crown of top PC vendor from rival Levono Group in Q1. In addition, Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty reiterated an Overweight rating on HP and increased her price target to $22 from $19:  In the past 18 months, HP removed over $1B of excess costs and refocused investment dollars on driving innovation across printing and personal systems. Recent product refreshes, including JetIntelligence laser printers, Sprocket mobile photo printer, and premium and gaming/VR-focused PCs are now driving share gains and a return to top-line growth (total revenue grew 2% and 4% Y/Y in last two fiscal quarters, respectively). By reinventing HP, we believe management is heralding a new era for the company whereby investors can expect greater confidence in top-line stabilization as well as earnings and FCF durability.  Yesterday, American Airlines (AAL) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
