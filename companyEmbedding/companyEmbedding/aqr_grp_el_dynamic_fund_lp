Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

Defensive Style Funds, Momentum Style Funds, Multi-Style Funds, International Equity Fund, Global Equity Fund and Relaxed Constraint Equity Funds: January 28, 2018

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.






AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

Investment Approach








Risk parity is all about diversification. Whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollar-based allocation, risk parity portfolios focus on risk-based allocation.
AQR's Risk Parity Fund invests globally across stocks, bonds, currencies  and commodities, allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky.
In building the portfolio, we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term.
We target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes, but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments, or “tilts,” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive.
We believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner, and adapting to market conditions, the Fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches.

Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term. There is also a chance that some of the fund’s holdings may have their credit rating downgraded or may default. Actual or realized volatility can and will differ from the forecasted or target volatility described above.

All returns shown are total returns that assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Returns for periods under a year are cumulative, all others are average annual returns. Investment returns and principal will fluctuate with market and economic conditions and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares. From time to time the Fund’s advisor may waive fees or reimbursed expenses, without which performance would have been lower. Please call 866-290-2688 for most recent month-end performance. 
Performance shown prior to a share class’s inception date reflects the historical performance of the Fund’s Class I shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of the Class N or Class R6 shares, respectively.



The Gross Expense Ratio includes all categories of expenses before any expense reductions or fee waivers.


The Net Expense Ratio per the Fund’s latest Prospectus. For the Diversified Arbitrage Fund and the Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, the Net Expense Ratio includes expenses related to short sales and interest on any borrowings.


The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee and/or reimburse expenses to the extent necessary to maintain the total annual Fund operating expenses at the stated levels. These expense caps are exclusive of expenses that may apply to some of the Funds, such as acquired fund fees, expenses related to short sales and borrowing costs, and extraordinary expenses. See the Prospectus for additional details. 

The expense caps are guaranteed until the following dates: Diversified Arbitrage Fund, Equity Market Neutral Fund, Global Macro Fund, Long/Short Equity Fund, Managed Futures Strategy Fund, Managed Futures Strategy HV Fund, Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund, Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy Fund, Risk Parity Fund, Risk Parity II MV Fund, Risk Parity II HV Fund, Style Premia Alternative Fund LV and Style Premia Alternative Fund: April 30, 2018

60/40 Portfolio benchmark consists of 60% S&P 500 Index / 40% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. The S&P 500 Index is a market value weighted index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity, and industry grouping, and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based index used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States.


AQR Risk Parity Fund:  Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. The use of derivatives, forward and futures contracts, and commodities exposes the Fund to additional risks including increased volatility, lack of liquidity, and possible losses greater than the Fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs. This fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed. If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential Fund gains and increase potential Fund losses. When investing in bonds, yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions. Investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels, bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term.

Alternative Thinking 1Q 2017: Capital Market Assumptions for Major Asset Classes


Topic:
Asset Allocation, Portfolio Management



This issue of Capital Market Assumptions updates our multi-year expected returns for major asset classes. Compared to historical averages, we are still very much in a world of low expected returns.
In this year’s edition, we modify our equity expected return methodologies to account for the growing corporate substitution of share buybacks for dividends. The topic is explored in greater depth in an Appendix which discusses specific details and presents the underlying theory and practical guidance on the data required to build these estimates.

Superstar Investors Webinar | December 13, 2016


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch are some of the most well-known investors of our time, but there has been little empirical analysis to explain their performance. In this webinar, Jordan Brooks and Dan Villalon examine the track records of these “superstars” from a factor perspective to see if their investment philosophies — applied systematically — can help demystify their long-term alpha.

Alternative Thinking 4Q 2016: Superstar Investors


Topic:
Portfolio Management, Factor Investing



Many famous investors are outspoken about their investment philosophies, and carefully apply them to a select number of securities. In this Alternative Thinking, we seek to apply their wisdom systematically; to ask whether their philosophies applied broadly might still generate “alpha”.
Our analysis suggests there are many ways to achieve long-run investment success. The takeaway for investors is to identify structural edges and commit to seeing them through inevitable periods of underperformance. As each of our superstars shows, “merely good” edges over time may compound to great long-term performance.

Topic:
Insights in Action, Webinar, Value Timing, Style Portfolio



Can Value Timing Improve a Style Portfolio?

Just like asset classes, styles - or factors - can become cheaper or more expensive than average. In this webinar, Cliff Asness and Ronen Israel discuss whether this information can be used to build a better style portfolio, and compare value timing to strategic diversification for style investors.
