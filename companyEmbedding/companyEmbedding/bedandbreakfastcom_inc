How it works

BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deals make it easy for you to find a last-minute getaway at a great rate!

 Every Wednesday, we will send you an email listing the Hot Deals in the geographic regions of your choice. All BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deals will also be available through the next Tuesday right here on the site.
 Each BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deal represents a savings of 20 percent or more, i.e. a $100 room for $80, or a $150 room and massage package for $120.
 Availability is extremely limited, so telephone for details right away. Some BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deals discount the inn's regular rates; others reduce the cost of a package deal. Just tell in the innkeepers you want the BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deal.
 BedandBreakfast.com Hot Deals are not applicable to prior reservations, nor can they be combined with other discounts. Other restrictions (two-night weekend minimum stays) may apply.

Marketing Strategy

The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast has a three-pronged strategy:

Association membership and advertising: A large number of visitors will look to regional B&B associations for information about the different B&B's in the area.  Most associations publish a guide to the local B&B's and The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast wants to be in this guide.  One of the other perks of membership is visibility on the associations website with a link to ours.   Additionally, we will be a member of the Chamber of Commerce because people typically inquire with the local Chamber when planning a vacation. 

Website: The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will have a full-service website that allows the visitor to view the B&B, read details about what it has to offer, provide information on regional activities, even allow the visitor to book a reservation.  With the growing use of the Internet, the Web has become an indispensable tool people have for planning vacation to areas that are not close enough to check out in person. 

Strategic relationship with the University of Oregon: The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will develop a partnership with the university so when the school is in need of finding rooms for guests they will use The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast.  We will also be advertising with the university so when students are searching for places for their parents to stay, they will come across The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast in school-related publications and feel more comfortable with booking a reservation sight unseen because of the trust bond they have formed with the university.

Mission
The mission of The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast is to provide the finest B&B experience.  We exist to attract and maintain customers.  When we adhere to this maxim, everything else will fall into place. Our services will exceed the expectations of our customers.
Marketing Objectives

Maintain positive, steady growth each quarter. 
Experience a growth in new customers who are turned into long-term customers. 
Realize an increase in occupancy each subsequent year.
Financial Objectives

A double digit growth rate for each future year.
Reduce the variable costs per guest.
Continue to decrease the fixed costs.
Target Marketing
Our customers can be broadly divided into three groups (please note that it is possible to divide the customers into much smaller groups, but we have chosen not to):

Weekend getaway customers: These people are from the region and are looking to get away so they come to The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast to be pampered and escape. 

Travelers: These people are passing through Eugene and prefer to stay in a B&B instead of a hotel/motel. 

University of Oregon travelers: The university brings a large number of people through Eugene and The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast believes that a good portion of their business will be from the university.  Occassions include parents weekend, orientation, parents visiting, and graduation.  Lastly, the university will often set up rooms for administrative visitors.
Positioning
The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will position itself as an upscale B&B with a gorgeous facility and unmatched customer attention.  
The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will leverage their competitive edge:
Attention to Personalized ServiceWhile anyone at a B&B should reasonably expect good service, there are ways of setting yourself apart from this already high level of service.  This will be done through the unrelenting pursuit of personal attention.  In the Eugene area there are several larger (more than six room) B&B's that offer outstanding service, but it is not personal.  What is meant by that is that the service is provided by employees, not the owner.  At The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast all interactions with the customer will be with Missy or John who see it as their duty to do whatever it takes to make the customer feel at home.  The feeling of personal attention, or more accurately defined as a sense of personal concern, not just mere personal attention, really adds a very positive dimension to the B&B experience.  Not only will the Stewarts be offering personal concern, but they will be providing the concern, not some employee. 
Uniqueness and Beauty of the FacilityThe Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will be housed in the Stewart's home.  The Stewart's will be renovating their farm house to accommodate their new guests. They will be building two more bedrooms with private baths, building a patio, and enlarging the common area.  One unique aspect of The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast is the setting within the Lorane Valley region, known for its outstanding wine production, housing both vineyards and wineries.  To compliment this setting, The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will have a large outside patio allowing guests to spend time relaxing outside with a nice view of the valley.  The guests also have the option to wander through The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast's own vineyard.  Each room in the B&B is 65% glass, overlooking the hill side and vineyard.  Basically there is not a room in the house that doesn't have a breathtaking view.
Strategy Pyramids
The single objective is to position The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast as the upscale B&B located in Eugene, reaching generally full occupancy within the first three years.  The marketing strategy will seek to first create customer awareness regarding the services offered, develop that customer base, and work building customer loyalty and strategic relationships with the university.
The message that The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast will seek to communicate is that The Enchanted Vineyard is the premier B&B in the Eugene area with the finest facilities.  The message will be communicated through a variety of methods.  The first will be advertising in the B&B association newsletter.  The next method will be a robust website with a comprehensive amount of information.  The last method will be developing strategic relationships with the university.  While this will require a budget for assorted activities, these activities are basically networking activities, taking people out to lunch and schmoozing.
Marketing Mix
The Enchanted Vineyard Bed & Breakfast's marketing mix is comprised of the following approach to pricing, distribution, advertising and promotion, and customer service.

Pricing: The pricing scheme is based on a room rate.  The rate is arrived at in terms of by its market value. 

Distribution: All services will be provided at the B&B. 

Advertising and Promotion: The most successful traditional advertising will be with the B&B association.  Developing strategic alliances with the university is a non-traditional method of marketing, but it will be quite efficient.  The website will also be used in marketing activities. 

Customer Service: Obsessive customer attention is the mantra.  The Enchanted Vineyard's philosophy is what ever needs to be done to make the customer happy must occur, even at the expense of short-term profits.  In the long run, this investment will pay off with fierce customer loyalty.
Marketing Research
During the initial phases of the marketing plan development, several focus groups were held to gain insight into a variety of B&B patrons.  These focus groups provided useful information into the decision making processes of consumers.
An additional source of dynamic market research is a feedback mechanism based on a suggestion card system.  The suggestion card has several statements that patrons are asked to rate in terms of a given scale.  There are also several open ended questions that allow the customer to freely offer constructive criticism or praise.  The Enchanted Vineyard will work hard to implement reasonable suggestions in order to improve their services as well as show their committment to the customer that their suggestions are valued.

Bedding

A good night’s sleep is important – make sure that every member of your family rests easy with top quality bedding sets that are attractive, durable and comfortable. Start with a sturdy mattress and pillow protectors along with the proper pillows then add sheets and pillowcases to suit your taste; use quilts and comforters to wrap yourself. The bedroom can be an oasis of quiet and comfort, free of any distractions which may impede sleep.

Make Your Inn, B&B or Vacation Rental Property Stand Out


May 3, 2016For Innkeepersbed and breakfast suppliesisadmin 


In our last blog post, I talked about how important it is to stay on top of your game.
To stay in business, we need to pay attention to industry trends and be ready to adapt our business plan. And part of paying attention means participating in industry trade shows to view and purchase products, and attend conferences and seminars.
These events are important because you can learn about new product innovations, and find out what competitors are doing.
For me, it also offers an opportunity to meet and greet customers and hear what they have to say about our industry, whether it’s their victories or their concerns.
When we do this sort of networking, we come away with ideas for ways to help customers keep their properties fresh and inviting.
Let’s take a look at a few ways to keep your inn, B&B or vacation rental property that way.

5 Types of Robes to Keep Your Guests Comfortable


April 8, 2016InnStyle Products, New Productsbed and breakfast supplies, hotel bathrobesisadmin 


For bed and breakfast owners who offer robes in their rooms, it’s not that unusual these days to see guests wearing a robe to breakfast.
That’s how much visitors love these robes. And who can blame them? There’s nothing like a warm, soft bathrobe to take the chill out of a cold morning.
The sight of a guest wearing a robe to breakfast would have been unusual years ago. But that’s not the only thing that’s different. The types of robes offered to guests at beds and breakfasts, spas and resorts have changed as well.
It used to be that terrycloth robes were the most common types of robe in the market, with velour showing up more often  in higher-end catalogs and hotels.
But over the years, robe manufacturers have come up with many different kinds of robes, with different fabrics, styling, colors and sizing and weights. Here’s a look at five of the most popular robe varieties.

Design Ideas for the Modern Innkeeper


August 16, 2013Bedding, For Innkeepers, InnStyle Productsammenities, bed and breakfast supplies, hospitality industry, Hospitality supplies, Hotel supplies wholesale, hypoallergenic pillows, innkeeper supplies, wholesale fine linensisadmin 


The concept of the “Bed and Breakfast” rose to popularity in United States during the 1800’s to provide respite and sustenance to miners, prospectors, and other pioneers as they made their way across the country in the development of the American West. Even as competition increased as more inns, lodges and hotels were built in the 1900’s, B&B’s remained popular and was seen as an affordable accommodation for people traveling through small towns or in areas that weren’t developed.
In the 21st century, B&B’s offer a cozy and accommodating alternative to the corporate hotel or motel − and are often found in locations that offer historical, leisure or small town attractions. For most travelers, the unique touches that distinguish a B&B were clearly the primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like “charm,” ambience,” “quaintness,” and “atmosphere” are often used to describe this intangible appeal.

The Beauty and Durability of Microfiber


July 15, 2013Bedding, For Innkeepers, In The News, Pillows, Tipsbed and breakfast supplies, Hospitality supplies, innkeeper products, microfiber, microfiber linens, microfiber table linens, sheets, wholesale table linens, wrinkle free sheetsisadmin 


Microfibers are used in a variety of fabrics, but most commonly in dress and blouse weight garments. They are very fine fibers, compared to more conventional forms − half the diameter of a fine silk fiber, one-third the diameter of cotton, one-quarter the diameter of fine wool, and one hundred times finer than human hair!
Although fine and lightweight, microfiber is anything but flimsy.
What is Microfiber?
In order to be classified “microfiber”, the fiber must be less than one denier.  A denier is the weight, in grams, of a 9000-meter length of fiber or yarn.  The higher the number − the thicker the fiber.
The many tiny fibers of microfiber are able to slide back and forth and maneuver around within the yarns of the fabric, allowing the fabric to flow and drape freely, yet still possess body and shape.  Microfiber fabrics are generally lightweight, resilient or resistant to wrinkling and have a luxurious drape and body, retain shape and resist pilling. They are also relatively strong and durable in relation to other fabrics of similar weight.
How Microfibers are Manufactured
Man-made fibers are formed by forcing a liquid through tiny holes in a device, called a spinneret. In microfiber, the holes are finer than with conventional fibers. Potentially any man-made fiber can be made into a microfiber, but are most commonly found in polyester and nylon.  Micros can be used alone, blended with conventional denier man-made fibers, or natural fibers such as cotton, wool and silk.
Benefits of Microfiber
Since these fine yarns can be packed tightly together, microfibers are especially useful in garments that require water repellency and wind resistance. Yet, the spaces between the yarns are porous enough to breathe and wick moisture away from the body.  Microfibers seem less “clammy” to wear, and is the perfect choice for warm weather and athletic clothing.
Caring For Microfibers
Garments made of microfiber can usually be cared for similar to garments made of conventional fabrics. Fabrics made from regular polyester and nylon fibers can be machine-washed and tumble dried. Use of paper dryer sheets is not recommended because temporary spotting from the heat of the dryer may occur.  Liquid fabric softener use is not a problem.
Viscose rayons perform best when dry-cleaned, however. As a general rule, fiber properties, not the fineness of the fiber, usually dictate recommended care.  It is important that one follow the care instructions on a particular garment.
A few precautions should be observed when caring for microfibers. Because the fibers are so fine, heat penetrates the fabric more quickly than conventional fabric. As a result, glazing, melting or scorching can occur quickly. If pressing is necessary, use only a cool iron and do not leave the iron on the fabric too long.
As with any fine garments, avoid use of jagged jewelry that may cause pulls, snags or creates general abrasion.
The Future of Microfiber Garments
The strength of microfibers make them particularly adaptable to suede or sandwashed finishes, such as polyester and nylon, because of their extensive fiber surfaces and use of strong fibers. As such, suit jackets and bottom weights are becoming increasingly available in microfiber. Micros are becoming increasingly the fabric of choice in clothing such as lingerie, rainwear, outdoor fleeces, wind-resistant sportswear, track and jogging suits. Many microfibers simulate the appearance of sandwashed silk and are excellent for use in utility fabrics for use in tents and sleeping bags.
Microfiber garments are generally durable and provide long-lasting wear, despite their fine silk-like feel. Enjoy microfiber garments in your wardrobe!
     





Add Romance To Your B & B With Canopies


June 14, 2013For Innkeepers, InnStyle ProductsB&B supplies, bed and breakfast supplies, bedding, heirloom canopies, innkeeper products, wholesale beddingisadmin 


Canopies are a symbol of lavishness, but this romantic accessory had a decidedly utility birth.
In the 13th century the canopy, which was suspended over the bed by cords from the
Heirloom Canopies
beams above, from which curtains were hung, was introduced out of necessity,
 
Houses had thatched roofs, and there was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This posed a real problem in the bedroom, where bugs and other droppings could mess up a nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection from dirt and cold.
Canopies also had functionality outside the bedroom. According to bedcanopy.com, “A cloth canopy, called a baldachin, would cover an altar or throne to distinguish religious authorities or the emperor.” Canopies can be as luxurious as gold-entwined fabric, or as simple as sheer mosquito netting to protect people from insects.
Canopies once served as protection from the chill, bugs, droppings and other environmental annoyances of the past. But as modern home heating technology has evolved and roofs are no longer in imminent danger of collapse, canopies have shed any utilitarian meaning and have become synonymous with romance.
The history of canopies may be functional, but a canopy from InnStyle is anything but strictly utility. InnStyle carries hand-tied canopies that are flat or arched, with six designs to choose from. All are made with pure cotton thread, are hand washable and preshrunk.
Choose from Natural or White, Double Diamond (15″ length), Single Diamond (12″ or 15″ length), Large Scallop (15″), Lover’s Knot (12″ or 15″), Margaret
Winston (12″ or 15″) or Straight Edge Diamond (15″). Available in Twin, Full, Queen and King.

Treat Your Guests like Royalty With Luxury Towels


June 10, 2013For Innkeepers, New ProductsB&B supplies, bed and breakfast supplies, innkeeper products, Terry Towels, towelsisadmin 


Your guests notice the little things that make them feel comforted and “regal” at your bed and breakfast. These little things add up to the biggest thing of all – your reputation!
There’s nothing more capable of impressing your guests than luxurious than high-quality terry cloth towels through InnStyle.
MicroCotton® Hotel Collection Towels
How lavish it feels to wrap ones self in a soft, absorbent fluffy bath towel right after a long, hot soak or shower. But not all towels are created equal. Here’s how to find the right one for you.
 
Terry cloth is a fabric with uncut loops, or pile, deliberately standing away from its ground base. Terry cloth is woven using two warp beams: the ground warp, which forms the base of the towel, and the pile warp, which creates the loops of thread that give the fabric its texture and function. These loops effectively increase the surface area of the fabric, enhancing its absorbency, while maintaining a soft feel.
Terry cloth is traditionally made from cotton, but it can also be made from different materials such as silk, linen or other natural and artificial fibers. Most manufacturers choose cotton because, unlike other materials that get weaker in water, cotton’s absorbent fiber gets stronger when wet. In fact, cotton can absorb 20 to 30 times its own weight in water. The loop pile acts as a sponge while withstanding squeezing, pulling, rubbing, twisting and turning.
Because of its absorbency attributes, terry cloth is commonly used for towels, bathrobes, beach cover-ups, athletic warm-ups and headbands. Terry cloth can easily be dyed or printed, as well as decoratively embroidered.
Terry cloth towels from InnStyle combine style, comfort and quality and are sure to make a lasting impression on your guests, making your B & B a crowned head in your industry.

Introducing The Powder Coat Square Tube Metal Luggage Rack


May 24, 2013For Innkeepers, InnStyle ProductsB&B supplies, B&b supplies / bed and breakfast supplies, bed and breakfast supplies, Hospitality supplies, Hotel supplies wholesale, innkeeper products, innkeeper supplies, luggage racksisadmin 


Most upscale hotels include stationary luggage racks as part of the amenities for their guests. These ingenious engineering marvels can come in handy especially when a guest is only staying for a short time and prefers to live out of the suitcase, as opposed to utilizing the chest of drawers. Luggage racks are also used effectively to raise a suitcase from the ground while packing or unpacking a suitcase, thus eliminating the guest’s need to constantly bend down while gathering items, which can create discomfort and lead to potential injury.
Optimally, you will want your bed and breakfast’s luggage racks to be somewhat ornate, so as to project a more luxurious aesthetic. The luggage rack may be constructed with materials that blend into the general décor, such as wood or combinations of wood with metal elements.
InnStyle now carries a hotel luggage rack that is sure to help make any guest feel at home! Our “Powder Coat Square Tube Metal Luggage Rack” is built of 1” square tube steel construction, which adds strength and durability to its beauty. This rack measures 20.25″Wx20”Hx 17”D and has a powder coat finish. It is lightweight and folds easily for quick storage.
This compact beauty is not only for use in the bed and breakfast and may also be used in the home as well. Used as a closet insert, it makes it possible to store suitcases in an organized fashion and can be easily kept on hand for the benefit of overnight guests in the home. The folding luggage rack can easily be stored away when not in use, and set up quickly to allow overnight guests a simple means of setting up the suitcase for easy access during the stay.
View InnStyle’s Luggage Racks that can be used in many ways to enhance your guest’s comfort. Or contact us at 267-354-6020 or toll-free at 1-800-877-INNS (4667).

NAICS Code: 721191  SIC Code: 7011
By: Peter C. Morales
The bed and breakfast is a niche segment of the travel industry. As part of this industry, bed and breakfasts are identified as a private residence that provides a room and a breakfast. While the terms “B and B’s” and “inns” are often used interchangeably, the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) differentiates between the two in that the former offers only breakfasts, while the latter may also offer lunch and dinner. The two most important factors of bed and breakfasts are their uniqueness and sense of social environment. Highlights of the Eighth Biennial Bed-and-Breakfast & Country Inns PAII Industry Study of Operations, Marketing, and Finance for 2002 show the following:

Average number of rooms for a bed and breakfast is 8.5, up from 8 rooms in 2000
95% of respondents offer rooms with private baths
93% – 94% of inns/bed and breakfasts are non-smoking
Responding inns employ 4.6 people
42% of bed and breakfasts have meeting rooms

Size of Business
Most bed & breakfasts are operated by a family and thus have no employees. For this reason, limited data is available through the US Census. County Business Patterns report data on establishments with paid employees only. According to the US Census Bureau County Business Patterns, there were 3,042 bed & breakfast inns with paid employees (721191). These bed & breakfasts employed 19,665 employees in 2001 in the United States. According to a survey conducted by the PAII there were some 20,000 licensed inns in the United States in 2004.
Bed and Breakfast Advertising
As bed and breakfasts are shifting their attention to the business traveler, so to have they have shifted the focus of their advertising to a more visible Web presence. Ray Coll, President of the Pittsburgh Bed & Breakfast Association states in an article published in the Pittsburgh Business Times that about 80 percent of business travelers find out about inns online. This is in keeping with a survey published in 2001 by CNNMoney online and conducted by B&B Getaways. The survey asked how guests find out about bed and breakfasts and reported the following results:

49% Internet
18% Word of mouth
6% Print advertising and travel guides

The survey also found that one-third of bed and breakfasts charge more than $125 a night.
Characteristics of Bed and Breakfast Operators
One common characteristic of bed and breakfast operators is that the motivation for starting a bed and breakfast is their love of people. Another trait operators share is that most do not rely solely on the bed and breakfast as the primary source of income. A PAII survey revealed a national trend that 55% of owners surveyed depend on additional outside income.
Impact of 9/11
Among the many industries impacted by 9/11, the travel industry was probably the most affected. The subsequent economic recession further hampered the industry as there was a sharp decline in the number of people traveling. Interestingly enough, however, PAII reports that while most hotels suffered a 7% decline in occupancy, bed and breakfasts only saw a decline of 4%. Despite the drop in demand, there was an increase in the average daily rate paid by guests that had a net result of 2.8% growth in total revenues.
Bed and Breakfasts and the Business Traveler
Traditionally, bed and breakfasts were seen as the prefect place for the weekend-getaway; however, this only accounted in occupancy for three nights of the week. With business travelers accounting for 52% of the lodging industry, bed and breakfasts are shifting their attention to these weekday travelers, adding amenities such as in-room data ports, high-speed Internet connections, DVD, and many other trappings sought by business travelers. More and more, bed and breakfasts are adding meeting room space to their facilities. Use of these facilities is often complimentary as bed and breakfasts are becoming preferred locations for retreats. A recent survey conducted by PAII found 42% of 800 respondents had meeting room space in 2002, compared to 28% in 2000.
Bed and Breakfasts with Meeting Rooms
2000         2002
28%           42%
Rural v. Urban Bed and Breakfasts
 
Rural bed and breakfasts get most of their business on the weekends and in the vacation season of April through September. Oftentimes the rural B&Bs serve as a weekend getaway. There are also rural B&Bs that are situated on wineries or operating ranches where guests may have access to wine tasting or offered horse rides. In addition, bed and breakfasts often partner with nearby attractions to offer vacation packages.
In comparison, urban locales may be fully operational year round. A comparable advantage for urban B&Bs is partnering with local chambers of commerce and companies to offer meeting room space. As shown above, the number of B&Bs offering meeting rooms is growing and to meet business peoples’ needs, may offer videoconferencing capacity.
Considerations
While there is no specific governing body regulating the bed and breakfast industry, they are often required to comply with federal, state, and local regulations. Of particular consideration are zoning regulations and local health and building codes. Additionally, as many of these bed and breakfasts are located in historic areas and buildings, it would behoove the operator to inquire with local historical associations on the significance of the property.

Breakfast at a B&B in Quebec City, Canada


A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.[1] A normal B&B usually have the hosts in the house.
Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board.

Overview[edit]
Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.
B&Bs and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs.
Some B&Bs operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned.
International differences[edit]
China[edit]
In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are tourists but they are growing in popularity among the Chinese.[2]
Cuba[edit]
In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B called casa particular ("private home") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.
Hungary[edit]
In Hungary, B&Bs are very popular. They usually are a small family-run hotel, have an intimate ambience and a pleasant atmosphere. It provides an affordable alternate for the hotels. In Hungarian the B&B is called "Panzió" or "Szálló".
India[edit]
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.[3] The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.[4] They have classified B&Bs in 2 categories - Gold B&Bs, and Silver B&Bs. All B&Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria.[5]
Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. The cost to rent a room(s) at standard B&Bs are around $100 to $120 per person per month, and premium B&B packages start around $180 per person per month, but may increase if more services are provided[citation needed]
Ireland[edit]
Registered Irish B&Bs are star rated by Fàilte Ireland and along with the majority unregistered B&Bs, form the B&B Owners Association Ireland. Generally, B&Bs in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners / Managers nearly always live on premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked "Irish Fry" or continental style buffet.
Israel[edit]




In the patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan


The Israeli B&B is known as a zimmer (Yiddish for room). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights) the zimmers has developed an extensive industry. Settlements belonging to private families and rural settlements are rented for a short period. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in community, kibbutzim, farms and individual seats decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev.[6][7]
Italy[edit]
In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs. There is a national law "Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001). [8]
Netherlands[edit]
Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence.Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. There are approximately 5,000 bed & breakfasts in the Netherlands.[citation needed]
New Zealand[edit]

Bed and breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than motels and often feature historic homes and furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.[citation needed]
Pakistan[edit]
The trend of B&Bs in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging.

Romania[edit]
While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called "Pensiune"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. A Bed and Breakfast offers clean and inexpensive accommodations as well as the opportunity to learn about the day-to-day life and culture of rural part Romania especially in Transylvania where B&B is more popular. Visitors will have the chance to try fresh, organic farm products.
Spain[edit]
Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was "Habitacion con derecho a cocina" which means "room along with use of the kitchen area". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. This has resulted in a degeneration of bed and breakfast standards.
Sweden[edit]
Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B. The B&B isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Skåne or near one of the three larger cites, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.
No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds.
In a Swedish B&B using the kitchen is not allowed for guests. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. Most people in Sweden speak and understand English, but in small establishments it often can be tricky to pay with Credit card or Euro. Swedish bed and breakfast may be found through local or regional tourist organizations or the owner's webpage.

Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire


B&Bs and guest houses are generally a budget option compared to hotels, although some up-market B&Bs also exist.[9] There are numerous B&Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.
B&Bs are graded by the Tourist Board on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B and Bs in the UK have en-suite facilities.
United States[edit]
The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel.
During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination.
After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs. The interest in B&Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. Many B&Bs created a historical ambiance by adapting historic properties (such as the 1830s Federal-style Holladay House in Orange, Virginia) as guesthouses decorated with antique furniture.[citation needed] Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided on-line reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews.
B&B and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.
There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs in the United States.[1] B&Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.
Regulations[edit]
Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement.
The most common regulations B&Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.
In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.
Professional and trade associations[edit]

Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. In the United States, the two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP).
While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care.
In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.
In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA).
In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high. In Ireland there is an association that will only use the national tourist board's approved members (Almara Accommodations Dublin)
Studies[edit]
Tourism Queensland study[edit]
In January 2003 Tourism Queensland conducted a review of current research to gain a better understanding of the Bed & Breakfast (B&B) market:[10]


“

Key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include: pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house, opposed to more 'standard' hotelrooms.
The following attributes are also appealing:

Homely or wholesome atmosphere (older segments) or luxurious/heritage surrounds
Home style meals
Area for conversing with other guests
Ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area.

Guests at B&Bs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at. The friendliness of the host was the most important factor, followed by easy access to other places, the site being the most appealing place in the region. Usually B & B´s are privately owned, therefore very different from standard commercial hotels.
Bed & Breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator. Visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment. Operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business, make new friends and contacts, understand the cultures and lifestyles of others, and to educate guests about their way of life.
Income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers. Changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement. Bed & Breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks, sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service.

”


Michigan State University study[edit]
According to a study by Michigan State University:[11]


“

The profile of B&B guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middle-aged, well-educated, (moderately) high income, professional market. On the last reported B&B trip, couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties.
Eighty-two percent of those sampled are married, and about half (44 percent) have children living at home. Average age for a travel party (respondent and spouse/partner ages are merged) is 40 years, with 60 percent under this age. This indicates that many B&B guests are at a mid-point in the traditional family cycle, when raising children is a primary activity. Newlyweds and "empty nesters" account for a smaller proportion. In fact, only 9 percent of the market is attributed to adults over 59 years of age.
Education levels are high, with the largest response category being completion of a college degree (31 percent). In addition, another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree. It follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers. Note that several categories such as business, health, education, and science are large enough for B&B's to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments.
The unique touches that distinguish a B&B are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like "charm," ambience," "quaintness," and "atmosphere" were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal. The importance of the "getaway" aspect demonstrates that B&B's have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter, more frequent weekend trips preferred by many two-income families. The lure of B&B's as a more personal alternative to the standard hotel/motel experience was reconfirmed by the 10 percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a B&B, the most frequent response to this open-ended question.
Customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent B&B experience, with 80 percent giving the experience an .. excellent" rating and another 17 percent calling it "good." Over 90 percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the B&B to friends and family.

”


According to this study, many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations, given by other guests. This system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net.
ComScore study[edit]
Another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests:[12]


“

People are willing to pay up to 99 percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them, according to new research.
The study, conducted in October by comScore and The Kelsey Group, found that online, consumer-created reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers. The researchers said 24 percent of those who eventually pay for local services -- such as restaurants, bed & breakfasts and automotive shops -- read online reviews before making a choice.
The study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews, they were willing to pay at least 20 percent, and up to 99 percent, more if a company was rated excellent or five-star than if a business received a good, or four-star, rating. The study was based on 2,078 survey respondents, including 508 who used online consumer reviews.
Professional critics, and owners of companies that receive less-than-excellent online reviews by laypersons, might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service. However, the comScore/Kelsey Group study found that 90 percent of the people who trusted consumer-written reviews found the critiques to be accurate. In fact, noted the researchers, "reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals."
The study included specific bed & breakfasts among others services. At least 75 percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision. Eighty-seven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice.
The take-away message for service providers, according to a statement issued by The Kelsey Group's research director, Steve Marshall: "With such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing, it's vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites."
The fact that one-in-four of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space, said Brian Jurutka, senior director at comScore Marketing Solutions. "That's a sizeable chunk," he said. "This helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise; it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites."

Journal of Travel Research study[edit]
A study by the Journal of Travel Research stated:[13]


“

While the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets, its use in the tourism industry is limited. This research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations.
Heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics. Using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations, the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies, a five star Champagne breakfast, and a room furnished with antique treasures...

”


Prince Edward Island study[edit]
A 2007 study on Prince Edward Island[14]


“

The vast majority of visitors to B & B are pleasure travellers. The most important reasons why travellers choose a B & B are personalised service and hospitality, price and value ratio, physical element, atmosphere, image and location.

”


TIME magazine[edit]
According to TIME magazine:[15]


“

Americans have a wide array of lodgings to choose from when they take a vacation: high-rise hotels, rustic resorts, motels by the bay. Yet more and more people are flocking to bed-and-breakfast inns, the most old-fashioned homes away from home. Just 20 years ago, there were only 1,000 B and Bs, as they are nicknamed, scattered throughout the country. Today there are more than 28,000 serving more than 50 million guests each year.
What's the appeal? Bed-and-breakfasts, often situated in elegant, historic homes, tap into everyone's fantasy of living another life. Many have been lovingly renovated with period decorations, inviting visitors to step back in time. Others carry a theme throughout the house. Since on average they have only seven or eight rooms, they offer peace and quiet, a rare commodity in the average home.
The hosts, who nearly always live on the premises, provide plenty of coddling. They will recommend local attractions, help with dinner reservations, often provide an afternoon tea or glass of sherry--and, yes, prepare a delicious homemade breakfast.
Prices at bed-and-breakfasts, which average $104 to $133 a night, depending on the region, rival the rates of good hotels. While some 10,000 B and Bs are private homes in which the owners offer a room or two, most are serious businesses, complete with websites and toll-free numbers.
The clientele tends to be couples, most of them affluent and well educated. Most are tourists or people who are in town to visit family or to celebrate a special occasion. Bed-and-breakfasts are popular with many foreign travelers, mostly from Britain, Germany, Canada, France and Australia, who have grown up going to B and Bs in their own countries.

Breakfast at a B&B in Quebec City, Canada


A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.[1] A normal B&B usually have the hosts in the house.
Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board.

Overview[edit]
Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.
B&Bs and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs.
Some B&Bs operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned.
International differences[edit]
China[edit]
In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are tourists but they are growing in popularity among the Chinese.[2]
Cuba[edit]
In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B called casa particular ("private home") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.
Hungary[edit]
In Hungary, B&Bs are very popular. They usually are a small family-run hotel, have an intimate ambience and a pleasant atmosphere. It provides an affordable alternate for the hotels. In Hungarian the B&B is called "Panzió" or "Szálló".
India[edit]
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.[3] The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.[4] They have classified B&Bs in 2 categories - Gold B&Bs, and Silver B&Bs. All B&Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria.[5]
Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. The cost to rent a room(s) at standard B&Bs are around $100 to $120 per person per month, and premium B&B packages start around $180 per person per month, but may increase if more services are provided[citation needed]
Ireland[edit]
Registered Irish B&Bs are star rated by Fàilte Ireland and along with the majority unregistered B&Bs, form the B&B Owners Association Ireland. Generally, B&Bs in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners / Managers nearly always live on premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked "Irish Fry" or continental style buffet.
Israel[edit]




In the patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan


The Israeli B&B is known as a zimmer (Yiddish for room). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights) the zimmers has developed an extensive industry. Settlements belonging to private families and rural settlements are rented for a short period. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in community, kibbutzim, farms and individual seats decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev.[6][7]
Italy[edit]
In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs. There is a national law "Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001). [8]
Netherlands[edit]
Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence.Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. There are approximately 5,000 bed & breakfasts in the Netherlands.[citation needed]
New Zealand[edit]

Bed and breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than motels and often feature historic homes and furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.[citation needed]
Pakistan[edit]
The trend of B&Bs in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging.




Carriage B&B Hinto Panzio in Transylvania, Odorheiu-Secuiesc (Szekelyudvarhely), Romania


Romania[edit]
While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called "Pensiune"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. A Bed and Breakfast offers clean and inexpensive accommodations as well as the opportunity to learn about the day-to-day life and culture of rural part Romania especially in Transylvania where B&B is more popular. Visitors will have the chance to try fresh, organic farm products.
Spain[edit]
Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was "Habitacion con derecho a cocina" which means "room along with use of the kitchen area". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. This has resulted in a degeneration of bed and breakfast standards.
Sweden[edit]
Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B. The B&B isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Skåne or near one of the three larger cites, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.
No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds.
In a Swedish B&B using the kitchen is not allowed for guests. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. Most people in Sweden speak and understand English, but in small establishments it often can be tricky to pay with Credit card or Euro. Swedish bed and breakfast may be found through local or regional tourist organizations or the owner's webpage.
United Kingdom[edit]

Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire


B&Bs and guest houses are generally a budget option compared to hotels, although some up-market B&Bs also exist.[9] There are numerous B&Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.
B&Bs are graded by the Tourist Board on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B and Bs in the UK have en-suite facilities.
United States[edit]
The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel.
During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination.
After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs. The interest in B&Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. Many B&Bs created a historical ambiance by adapting historic properties (such as the 1830s Federal-style Holladay House in Orange, Virginia) as guesthouses decorated with antique furniture.[citation needed] Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided on-line reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews.
B&B and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.
There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs in the United States.[1] B&Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.
Regulations[edit]
Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement.
The most common regulations B&Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.
In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.
Professional and trade associations[edit]

Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. In the United States, the two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP).
While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care.
In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.
In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA).
In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high. In Ireland there is an association that will only use the national tourist board's approved members (Almara Accommodations Dublin)
Studies[edit]
Tourism Queensland study[edit]
In January 2003 Tourism Queensland conducted a review of current research to gain a better understanding of the Bed & Breakfast (B&B) market:[10]


“

Key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include: pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house, opposed to more 'standard' hotelrooms.
The following attributes are also appealing:

Homely or wholesome atmosphere (older segments) or luxurious/heritage surrounds
Home style meals
Area for conversing with other guests
Ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area.

Guests at B&Bs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at. The friendliness of the host was the most important factor, followed by easy access to other places, the site being the most appealing place in the region. Usually B & B´s are privately owned, therefore very different from standard commercial hotels.
Bed & Breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator. Visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment. Operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business, make new friends and contacts, understand the cultures and lifestyles of others, and to educate guests about their way of life.
Income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers. Changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement. Bed & Breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks, sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service.

”


Michigan State University study[edit]
According to a study by Michigan State University:[11]


“

The profile of B&B guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middle-aged, well-educated, (moderately) high income, professional market. On the last reported B&B trip, couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties.
Eighty-two percent of those sampled are married, and about half (44 percent) have children living at home. Average age for a travel party (respondent and spouse/partner ages are merged) is 40 years, with 60 percent under this age. This indicates that many B&B guests are at a mid-point in the traditional family cycle, when raising children is a primary activity. Newlyweds and "empty nesters" account for a smaller proportion. In fact, only 9 percent of the market is attributed to adults over 59 years of age.
Education levels are high, with the largest response category being completion of a college degree (31 percent). In addition, another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree. It follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers. Note that several categories such as business, health, education, and science are large enough for B&B's to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments.
The unique touches that distinguish a B&B are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like "charm," ambience," "quaintness," and "atmosphere" were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal. The importance of the "getaway" aspect demonstrates that B&B's have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter, more frequent weekend trips preferred by many two-income families. The lure of B&B's as a more personal alternative to the standard hotel/motel experience was reconfirmed by the 10 percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a B&B, the most frequent response to this open-ended question.
Customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent B&B experience, with 80 percent giving the experience an .. excellent" rating and another 17 percent calling it "good." Over 90 percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the B&B to friends and family.

”


According to this study, many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations, given by other guests. This system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net.
ComScore study[edit]
Another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests:[12]


“

People are willing to pay up to 99 percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them, according to new research.
The study, conducted in October by comScore and The Kelsey Group, found that online, consumer-created reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers. The researchers said 24 percent of those who eventually pay for local services -- such as restaurants, bed & breakfasts and automotive shops -- read online reviews before making a choice.
The study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews, they were willing to pay at least 20 percent, and up to 99 percent, more if a company was rated excellent or five-star than if a business received a good, or four-star, rating. The study was based on 2,078 survey respondents, including 508 who used online consumer reviews.
Professional critics, and owners of companies that receive less-than-excellent online reviews by laypersons, might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service. However, the comScore/Kelsey Group study found that 90 percent of the people who trusted consumer-written reviews found the critiques to be accurate. In fact, noted the researchers, "reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals."
The study included specific bed & breakfasts among others services. At least 75 percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision. Eighty-seven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice.
The take-away message for service providers, according to a statement issued by The Kelsey Group's research director, Steve Marshall: "With such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing, it's vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites."
The fact that one-in-four of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space, said Brian Jurutka, senior director at comScore Marketing Solutions. "That's a sizeable chunk," he said. "This helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise; it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites."

Journal of Travel Research study[edit]
A study by the Journal of Travel Research stated:[13]


“

While the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets, its use in the tourism industry is limited. This research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations.
Heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics. Using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations, the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies, a five star Champagne breakfast, and a room furnished with antique treasures...

”


Prince Edward Island study[edit]
A 2007 study on Prince Edward Island[14]


“

The vast majority of visitors to B & B are pleasure travellers. The most important reasons why travellers choose a B & B are personalised service and hospitality, price and value ratio, physical element, atmosphere, image and location.

”


TIME magazine[edit]
According to TIME magazine:[15]


“

Americans have a wide array of lodgings to choose from when they take a vacation: high-rise hotels, rustic resorts, motels by the bay. Yet more and more people are flocking to bed-and-breakfast inns, the most old-fashioned homes away from home. Just 20 years ago, there were only 1,000 B and Bs, as they are nicknamed, scattered throughout the country. Today there are more than 28,000 serving more than 50 million guests each year.
What's the appeal? Bed-and-breakfasts, often situated in elegant, historic homes, tap into everyone's fantasy of living another life. Many have been lovingly renovated with period decorations, inviting visitors to step back in time. Others carry a theme throughout the house. Since on average they have only seven or eight rooms, they offer peace and quiet, a rare commodity in the average home.
The hosts, who nearly always live on the premises, provide plenty of coddling. They will recommend local attractions, help with dinner reservations, often provide an afternoon tea or glass of sherry--and, yes, prepare a delicious homemade breakfast.
Prices at bed-and-breakfasts, which average $104 to $133 a night, depending on the region, rival the rates of good hotels. While some 10,000 B and Bs are private homes in which the owners offer a room or two, most are serious businesses, complete with websites and toll-free numbers.
The clientele tends to be couples, most of them affluent and well educated. Most are tourists or people who are in town to visit family or to celebrate a special occasion. Bed-and-breakfasts are popular with many foreign travelers, mostly from Britain, Germany, Canada, France and Australia, who have grown up going to B and Bs in their own countries.

Breakfast at a B&B in Quebec City, Canada


A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.[1] A normal B&B usually have the hosts in the house.
Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board.

Overview[edit]
Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.
B&Bs and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs.
Some B&Bs operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned.
International differences[edit]
China[edit]
In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are tourists but they are growing in popularity among the Chinese.[2]
Cuba[edit]
In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B called casa particular ("private home") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.
Hungary[edit]
In Hungary, B&Bs are very popular. They usually are a small family-run hotel, have an intimate ambience and a pleasant atmosphere. It provides an affordable alternate for the hotels. In Hungarian the B&B is called "Panzió" or "Szálló".
India[edit]
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.[3] The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.[4] They have classified B&Bs in 2 categories - Gold B&Bs, and Silver B&Bs. All B&Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria.[5]
Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. The cost to rent a room(s) at standard B&Bs are around $100 to $120 per person per month, and premium B&B packages start around $180 per person per month, but may increase if more services are provided[citation needed]
Ireland[edit]
Registered Irish B&Bs are star rated by Fàilte Ireland and along with the majority unregistered B&Bs, form the B&B Owners Association Ireland. Generally, B&Bs in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners / Managers nearly always live on premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked "Irish Fry" or continental style buffet.
Israel[edit]




In the patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan


The Israeli B&B is known as a zimmer (Yiddish for room). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights) the zimmers has developed an extensive industry. Settlements belonging to private families and rural settlements are rented for a short period. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in community, kibbutzim, farms and individual seats decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev.[6][7]
Italy[edit]
In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs. There is a national law "Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001). [8]
Netherlands[edit]
Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence.Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. There are approximately 5,000 bed & breakfasts in the Netherlands.[citation needed]
New Zealand[edit]




A Centre of New Zealand Bed and Breakfast






The front yard of the Dupont at the Circle B&B, located at 1604 19th Street, N.W., in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Snow continues to pile up during the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard.


Bed and breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than motels and often feature historic homes and furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.[citation needed]
Pakistan[edit]
The trend of B&Bs in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging.




Carriage B&B Hinto Panzio in Transylvania, Odorheiu-Secuiesc (Szekelyudvarhely), Romania


Romania[edit]
While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called "Pensiune"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. A Bed and Breakfast offers clean and inexpensive accommodations as well as the opportunity to learn about the day-to-day life and culture of rural part Romania especially in Transylvania where B&B is more popular. Visitors will have the chance to try fresh, organic farm products.
Spain[edit]
Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was "Habitacion con derecho a cocina" which means "room along with use of the kitchen area". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. This has resulted in a degeneration of bed and breakfast standards.
Sweden[edit]
Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B. The B&B isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Skåne or near one of the three larger cites, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.
No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds.
In a Swedish B&B using the kitchen is not allowed for guests. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. Most people in Sweden speak and understand English, but in small establishments it often can be tricky to pay with Credit card or Euro. Swedish bed and breakfast may be found through local or regional tourist organizations or the owner's webpage.
United Kingdom[edit]

Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire


B&Bs and guest houses are generally a budget option compared to hotels, although some up-market B&Bs also exist.[9] There are numerous B&Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.
B&Bs are graded by the Tourist Board on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B and Bs in the UK have en-suite facilities.
United States[edit]
The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel.
During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination.
After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs. The interest in B&Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. Many B&Bs created a historical ambiance by adapting historic properties (such as the 1830s Federal-style Holladay House in Orange, Virginia) as guesthouses decorated with antique furniture.[citation needed] Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided on-line reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews.
B&B and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.
There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs in the United States.[1] B&Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.
Regulations[edit]
Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement.
The most common regulations B&Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.
In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.
Professional and trade associations[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. In the United States, the two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP).
While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care.
In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.
In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA).
In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high. In Ireland there is an association that will only use the national tourist board's approved members (Almara Accommodations Dublin)
Studies[edit]
Tourism Queensland study[edit]
In January 2003 Tourism Queensland conducted a review of current research to gain a better understanding of the Bed & Breakfast (B&B) market:[10]


“

Key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include: pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house, opposed to more 'standard' hotelrooms.
The following attributes are also appealing:

Homely or wholesome atmosphere (older segments) or luxurious/heritage surrounds
Home style meals
Area for conversing with other guests
Ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area.

Guests at B&Bs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at. The friendliness of the host was the most important factor, followed by easy access to other places, the site being the most appealing place in the region. Usually B & B´s are privately owned, therefore very different from standard commercial hotels.
Bed & Breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator. Visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment. Operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business, make new friends and contacts, understand the cultures and lifestyles of others, and to educate guests about their way of life.
Income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers. Changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement. Bed & Breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks, sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service.

”


Michigan State University study[edit]
According to a study by Michigan State University:[11]


“

The profile of B&B guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middle-aged, well-educated, (moderately) high income, professional market. On the last reported B&B trip, couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties.
Eighty-two percent of those sampled are married, and about half (44 percent) have children living at home. Average age for a travel party (respondent and spouse/partner ages are merged) is 40 years, with 60 percent under this age. This indicates that many B&B guests are at a mid-point in the traditional family cycle, when raising children is a primary activity. Newlyweds and "empty nesters" account for a smaller proportion. In fact, only 9 percent of the market is attributed to adults over 59 years of age.
Education levels are high, with the largest response category being completion of a college degree (31 percent). In addition, another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree. It follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers. Note that several categories such as business, health, education, and science are large enough for B&B's to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments.
The unique touches that distinguish a B&B are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like "charm," ambience," "quaintness," and "atmosphere" were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal. The importance of the "getaway" aspect demonstrates that B&B's have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter, more frequent weekend trips preferred by many two-income families. The lure of B&B's as a more personal alternative to the standard hotel/motel experience was reconfirmed by the 10 percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a B&B, the most frequent response to this open-ended question.
Customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent B&B experience, with 80 percent giving the experience an .. excellent" rating and another 17 percent calling it "good." Over 90 percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the B&B to friends and family.

”


According to this study, many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations, given by other guests. This system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net.
ComScore study[edit]
Another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests:[12]


“

People are willing to pay up to 99 percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them, according to new research.
The study, conducted in October by comScore and The Kelsey Group, found that online, consumer-created reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers. The researchers said 24 percent of those who eventually pay for local services -- such as restaurants, bed & breakfasts and automotive shops -- read online reviews before making a choice.
The study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews, they were willing to pay at least 20 percent, and up to 99 percent, more if a company was rated excellent or five-star than if a business received a good, or four-star, rating. The study was based on 2,078 survey respondents, including 508 who used online consumer reviews.
Professional critics, and owners of companies that receive less-than-excellent online reviews by laypersons, might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service. However, the comScore/Kelsey Group study found that 90 percent of the people who trusted consumer-written reviews found the critiques to be accurate. In fact, noted the researchers, "reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals."
The study included specific bed & breakfasts among others services. At least 75 percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision. Eighty-seven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice.
The take-away message for service providers, according to a statement issued by The Kelsey Group's research director, Steve Marshall: "With such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing, it's vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites."
The fact that one-in-four of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space, said Brian Jurutka, senior director at comScore Marketing Solutions. "That's a sizeable chunk," he said. "This helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise; it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites."

Journal of Travel Research study[edit]
A study by the Journal of Travel Research stated:[13]


“

While the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets, its use in the tourism industry is limited. This research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations.
Heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics. Using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations, the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies, a five star Champagne breakfast, and a room furnished with antique treasures...

”


Prince Edward Island study[edit]
A 2007 study on Prince Edward Island[14]


“

The vast majority of visitors to B & B are pleasure travellers. The most important reasons why travellers choose a B & B are personalised service and hospitality, price and value ratio, physical element, atmosphere, image and location.

”


TIME magazine[edit]
According to TIME magazine:[15]


“

Americans have a wide array of lodgings to choose from when they take a vacation: high-rise hotels, rustic resorts, motels by the bay. Yet more and more people are flocking to bed-and-breakfast inns, the most old-fashioned homes away from home. Just 20 years ago, there were only 1,000 B and Bs, as they are nicknamed, scattered throughout the country. Today there are more than 28,000 serving more than 50 million guests each year.
What's the appeal? Bed-and-breakfasts, often situated in elegant, historic homes, tap into everyone's fantasy of living another life. Many have been lovingly renovated with period decorations, inviting visitors to step back in time. Others carry a theme throughout the house. Since on average they have only seven or eight rooms, they offer peace and quiet, a rare commodity in the average home.
The hosts, who nearly always live on the premises, provide plenty of coddling. They will recommend local attractions, help with dinner reservations, often provide an afternoon tea or glass of sherry--and, yes, prepare a delicious homemade breakfast.
Prices at bed-and-breakfasts, which average $104 to $133 a night, depending on the region, rival the rates of good hotels. While some 10,000 B and Bs are private homes in which the owners offer a room or two, most are serious businesses, complete with websites and toll-free numbers.
The clientele tends to be couples, most of them affluent and well educated. Most are tourists or people who are in town to visit family or to celebrate a special occasion. Bed-and-breakfasts are popular with many foreign travelers, mostly from Britain, Germany, Canada, France and Australia, who have grown up going to B and Bs in their own countries.

Breakfast at a B&B in Quebec City, Canada


A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.[1] A normal B&B usually have the hosts in the house.
Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board.

Overview[edit]
Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.
B&Bs and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs.
Some B&Bs operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned.
International differences[edit]
China[edit]
In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are tourists but they are growing in popularity among the Chinese.[2]
Cuba[edit]
In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B called casa particular ("private home") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.
Hungary[edit]
In Hungary, B&Bs are very popular. They usually are a small family-run hotel, have an intimate ambience and a pleasant atmosphere. It provides an affordable alternate for the hotels. In Hungarian the B&B is called "Panzió" or "Szálló".
India[edit]
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.[3] The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.[4] They have classified B&Bs in 2 categories - Gold B&Bs, and Silver B&Bs. All B&Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria.[5]
Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. The cost to rent a room(s) at standard B&Bs are around $100 to $120 per person per month, and premium B&B packages start around $180 per person per month, but may increase if more services are provided[citation needed]
Ireland[edit]
Registered Irish B&Bs are star rated by Fàilte Ireland and along with the majority unregistered B&Bs, form the B&B Owners Association Ireland. Generally, B&Bs in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners / Managers nearly always live on premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked "Irish Fry" or continental style buffet.
Israel[edit]




In the patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan


The Israeli B&B is known as a zimmer (Yiddish for room). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights) the zimmers has developed an extensive industry. Settlements belonging to private families and rural settlements are rented for a short period. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in community, kibbutzim, farms and individual seats decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev.[6][7]
Italy[edit]
In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs. There is a national law "Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001). [8]
Netherlands[edit]
Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence.Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. There are approximately 5,000 bed & breakfasts in the Netherlands.[citation needed]
New Zealand[edit]

Bed and breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than motels and often feature historic homes and furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.[citation needed]
Pakistan[edit]
The trend of B&Bs in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging.




Carriage B&B Hinto Panzio in Transylvania, Odorheiu-Secuiesc (Szekelyudvarhely), Romania


Romania[edit]
While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called "Pensiune"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. A Bed and Breakfast offers clean and inexpensive accommodations as well as the opportunity to learn about the day-to-day life and culture of rural part Romania especially in Transylvania where B&B is more popular. Visitors will have the chance to try fresh, organic farm products.
Spain[edit]
Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was "Habitacion con derecho a cocina" which means "room along with use of the kitchen area". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. This has resulted in a degeneration of bed and breakfast standards.
Sweden[edit]
Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B. The B&B isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Skåne or near one of the three larger cites, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.
No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds.
In a Swedish B&B using the kitchen is not allowed for guests. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. Most people in Sweden speak and understand English, but in small establishments it often can be tricky to pay with Credit card or Euro. Swedish bed and breakfast may be found through local or regional tourist organizations or the owner's webpage.
United Kingdom[edit]

Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire


B&Bs and guest houses are generally a budget option compared to hotels, although some up-market B&Bs also exist.[9] There are numerous B&Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.
B&Bs are graded by the Tourist Board on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B and Bs in the UK have en-suite facilities.
United States[edit]
The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel.
During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination.
After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs. The interest in B&Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. Many B&Bs created a historical ambiance by adapting historic properties (such as the 1830s Federal-style Holladay House in Orange, Virginia) as guesthouses decorated with antique furniture.[citation needed] Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided on-line reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews.
B&B and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.
There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs in the United States.[1] B&Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.
Regulations[edit]
Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement.
The most common regulations B&Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.
In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.
Professional and trade associations[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. In the United States, the two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP).
While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care.
In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.
In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA).
In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high. In Ireland there is an association that will only use the national tourist board's approved members (Almara Accommodations Dublin)
Studies[edit]
Tourism Queensland study[edit]
In January 2003 Tourism Queensland conducted a review of current research to gain a better understanding of the Bed & Breakfast (B&B) market:[10]


“

Key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include: pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house, opposed to more 'standard' hotelrooms.
The following attributes are also appealing:

Homely or wholesome atmosphere (older segments) or luxurious/heritage surrounds
Home style meals
Area for conversing with other guests
Ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area.

Guests at B&Bs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at. The friendliness of the host was the most important factor, followed by easy access to other places, the site being the most appealing place in the region. Usually B & B´s are privately owned, therefore very different from standard commercial hotels.
Bed & Breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator. Visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment. Operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business, make new friends and contacts, understand the cultures and lifestyles of others, and to educate guests about their way of life.
Income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers. Changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement. Bed & Breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks, sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service.

According to a study by Michigan State University:[11]


“

The profile of B&B guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middle-aged, well-educated, (moderately) high income, professional market. On the last reported B&B trip, couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties.
Eighty-two percent of those sampled are married, and about half (44 percent) have children living at home. Average age for a travel party (respondent and spouse/partner ages are merged) is 40 years, with 60 percent under this age. This indicates that many B&B guests are at a mid-point in the traditional family cycle, when raising children is a primary activity. Newlyweds and "empty nesters" account for a smaller proportion. In fact, only 9 percent of the market is attributed to adults over 59 years of age.
Education levels are high, with the largest response category being completion of a college degree (31 percent). In addition, another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree. It follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers. Note that several categories such as business, health, education, and science are large enough for B&B's to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments.
The unique touches that distinguish a B&B are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like "charm," ambience," "quaintness," and "atmosphere" were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal. The importance of the "getaway" aspect demonstrates that B&B's have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter, more frequent weekend trips preferred by many two-income families. The lure of B&B's as a more personal alternative to the standard hotel/motel experience was reconfirmed by the 10 percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a B&B, the most frequent response to this open-ended question.
Customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent B&B experience, with 80 percent giving the experience an .. excellent" rating and another 17 percent calling it "good." Over 90 percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the B&B to friends and family.

According to this study, many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations, given by other guests. This system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net.
ComScore study[edit]
Another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests:[12]


“

People are willing to pay up to 99 percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them, according to new research.
The study, conducted in October by comScore and The Kelsey Group, found that online, consumer-created reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers. The researchers said 24 percent of those who eventually pay for local services -- such as restaurants, bed & breakfasts and automotive shops -- read online reviews before making a choice.
The study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews, they were willing to pay at least 20 percent, and up to 99 percent, more if a company was rated excellent or five-star than if a business received a good, or four-star, rating. The study was based on 2,078 survey respondents, including 508 who used online consumer reviews.
Professional critics, and owners of companies that receive less-than-excellent online reviews by laypersons, might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service. However, the comScore/Kelsey Group study found that 90 percent of the people who trusted consumer-written reviews found the critiques to be accurate. In fact, noted the researchers, "reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals."
The study included specific bed & breakfasts among others services. At least 75 percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision. Eighty-seven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice.
The take-away message for service providers, according to a statement issued by The Kelsey Group's research director, Steve Marshall: "With such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing, it's vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites."
The fact that one-in-four of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space, said Brian Jurutka, senior director at comScore Marketing Solutions. "That's a sizeable chunk," he said. "This helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise; it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites."

Journal of Travel Research study[edit]
A study by the Journal of Travel Research stated:[13]


“

While the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets, its use in the tourism industry is limited. This research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations.
Heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics. Using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations, the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies, a five star Champagne breakfast, and a room furnished with antique treasures...

Prince Edward Island study[edit]
A 2007 study on Prince Edward Island[14]


“

The vast majority of visitors to B & B are pleasure travellers. The most important reasons why travellers choose a B & B are personalised service and hospitality, price and value ratio, physical element, atmosphere, image and location.

”


TIME magazine[edit]
According to TIME magazine:[15]


“

Americans have a wide array of lodgings to choose from when they take a vacation: high-rise hotels, rustic resorts, motels by the bay. Yet more and more people are flocking to bed-and-breakfast inns, the most old-fashioned homes away from home. Just 20 years ago, there were only 1,000 B and Bs, as they are nicknamed, scattered throughout the country. Today there are more than 28,000 serving more than 50 million guests each year.
What's the appeal? Bed-and-breakfasts, often situated in elegant, historic homes, tap into everyone's fantasy of living another life. Many have been lovingly renovated with period decorations, inviting visitors to step back in time. Others carry a theme throughout the house. Since on average they have only seven or eight rooms, they offer peace and quiet, a rare commodity in the average home.
The hosts, who nearly always live on the premises, provide plenty of coddling. They will recommend local attractions, help with dinner reservations, often provide an afternoon tea or glass of sherry--and, yes, prepare a delicious homemade breakfast.
Prices at bed-and-breakfasts, which average $104 to $133 a night, depending on the region, rival the rates of good hotels. While some 10,000 B and Bs are private homes in which the owners offer a room or two, most are serious businesses, complete with websites and toll-free numbers.
The clientele tends to be couples, most of them affluent and well educated. Most are tourists or people who are in town to visit family or to celebrate a special occasion. Bed-and-breakfasts are popular with many foreign travelers, mostly from Britain, Germany, Canada, France and Australia, who have grown up going to B and Bs in their own countries.

Breakfast at a B&B in Quebec City, Canada


A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.[1] A normal B&B usually have the hosts in the house.
Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board.

Overview[edit]
Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.
B&Bs and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs.
Some B&Bs operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned.
International differences[edit]
China[edit]
In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are tourists but they are growing in popularity among the Chinese.[2]
Cuba[edit]
In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B called casa particular ("private home") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.
Hungary[edit]
In Hungary, B&Bs are very popular. They usually are a small family-run hotel, have an intimate ambience and a pleasant atmosphere. It provides an affordable alternate for the hotels. In Hungarian the B&B is called "Panzió" or "Szálló".
India[edit]
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.[3] The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.[4] They have classified B&Bs in 2 categories - Gold B&Bs, and Silver B&Bs. All B&Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria.[5]
Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. The cost to rent a room(s) at standard B&Bs are around $100 to $120 per person per month, and premium B&B packages start around $180 per person per month, but may increase if more services are provided[citation needed]
Ireland[edit]
Registered Irish B&Bs are star rated by Fàilte Ireland and along with the majority unregistered B&Bs, form the B&B Owners Association Ireland. Generally, B&Bs in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners / Managers nearly always live on premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked "Irish Fry" or continental style buffet.
Israel[edit]




In the patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan


The Israeli B&B is known as a zimmer (Yiddish for room). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and Golan Heights) the zimmers has developed an extensive industry. Settlements belonging to private families and rural settlements are rented for a short period. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in community, kibbutzim, farms and individual seats decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev.[6][7]
Italy[edit]
In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs. There is a national law "Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001). [8]
Netherlands[edit]
Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence.Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. There are approximately 5,000 bed & breakfasts in the Netherlands.[citation needed]
New Zealand[edit]

Bed and breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than motels and often feature historic homes and furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.[citation needed]
Pakistan[edit]
The trend of B&Bs in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging.




Carriage B&B Hinto Panzio in Transylvania, Odorheiu-Secuiesc (Szekelyudvarhely), Romania


Romania[edit]
While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called "Pensiune"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. A Bed and Breakfast offers clean and inexpensive accommodations as well as the opportunity to learn about the day-to-day life and culture of rural part Romania especially in Transylvania where B&B is more popular. Visitors will have the chance to try fresh, organic farm products.
Spain[edit]
Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was "Habitacion con derecho a cocina" which means "room along with use of the kitchen area". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. This has resulted in a degeneration of bed and breakfast standards.
Sweden[edit]
Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B. The B&B isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Skåne or near one of the three larger cites, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.
No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds.
In a Swedish B&B using the kitchen is not allowed for guests. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. Most people in Sweden speak and understand English, but in small establishments it often can be tricky to pay with Credit card or Euro. Swedish bed and breakfast may be found through local or regional tourist organizations or the owner's webpage.
United Kingdom[edit]

Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire


B&Bs and guest houses are generally a budget option compared to hotels, although some up-market B&Bs also exist.[9] There are numerous B&Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.
B&Bs are graded by the Tourist Board on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B and Bs in the UK have en-suite facilities.
United States[edit]
The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel.
During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination.
After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs. The interest in B&Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. Many B&Bs created a historical ambiance by adapting historic properties (such as the 1830s Federal-style Holladay House in Orange, Virginia) as guesthouses decorated with antique furniture.[citation needed] Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided on-line reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews.
B&B and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.
There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs in the United States.[1] B&Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.
Regulations[edit]
Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement.
The most common regulations B&Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.
In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.
Professional and trade associations[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. In the United States, the two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP).
While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care.
In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.
In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA).
In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high. In Ireland there is an association that will only use the national tourist board's approved members (Almara Accommodations Dublin)
Studies[edit]
Tourism Queensland study[edit]
In January 2003 Tourism Queensland conducted a review of current research to gain a better understanding of the Bed & Breakfast (B&B) market:[10]


“

Key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include: pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house, opposed to more 'standard' hotelrooms.
The following attributes are also appealing:

Homely or wholesome atmosphere (older segments) or luxurious/heritage surrounds
Home style meals
Area for conversing with other guests
Ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area.

Guests at B&Bs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at. The friendliness of the host was the most important factor, followed by easy access to other places, the site being the most appealing place in the region. Usually B & B´s are privately owned, therefore very different from standard commercial hotels.
Bed & Breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator. Visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment. Operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business, make new friends and contacts, understand the cultures and lifestyles of others, and to educate guests about their way of life.
Income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers. Changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement. Bed & Breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks, sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service.

”


Michigan State University study[edit]
According to a study by Michigan State University:[11]


“

The profile of B&B guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middle-aged, well-educated, (moderately) high income, professional market. On the last reported B&B trip, couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties.
Eighty-two percent of those sampled are married, and about half (44 percent) have children living at home. Average age for a travel party (respondent and spouse/partner ages are merged) is 40 years, with 60 percent under this age. This indicates that many B&B guests are at a mid-point in the traditional family cycle, when raising children is a primary activity. Newlyweds and "empty nesters" account for a smaller proportion. In fact, only 9 percent of the market is attributed to adults over 59 years of age.
Education levels are high, with the largest response category being completion of a college degree (31 percent). In addition, another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree. It follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers. Note that several categories such as business, health, education, and science are large enough for B&B's to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments.
The unique touches that distinguish a B&B are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option. Words like "charm," ambience," "quaintness," and "atmosphere" were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal. The importance of the "getaway" aspect demonstrates that B&B's have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter, more frequent weekend trips preferred by many two-income families. The lure of B&B's as a more personal alternative to the standard hotel/motel experience was reconfirmed by the 10 percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a B&B, the most frequent response to this open-ended question.
Customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent B&B experience, with 80 percent giving the experience an .. excellent" rating and another 17 percent calling it "good." Over 90 percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the B&B to friends and family.

According to this study, many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations, given by other guests. This system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net.
ComScore study[edit]
Another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests:[12]


“

People are willing to pay up to 99 percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them, according to new research.
The study, conducted in October by comScore and The Kelsey Group, found that online, consumer-created reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers. The researchers said 24 percent of those who eventually pay for local services -- such as restaurants, bed & breakfasts and automotive shops -- read online reviews before making a choice.
The study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews, they were willing to pay at least 20 percent, and up to 99 percent, more if a company was rated excellent or five-star than if a business received a good, or four-star, rating. The study was based on 2,078 survey respondents, including 508 who used online consumer reviews.
Professional critics, and owners of companies that receive less-than-excellent online reviews by laypersons, might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service. However, the comScore/Kelsey Group study found that 90 percent of the people who trusted consumer-written reviews found the critiques to be accurate. In fact, noted the researchers, "reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals."
The study included specific bed & breakfasts among others services. At least 75 percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision. Eighty-seven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice.
The take-away message for service providers, according to a statement issued by The Kelsey Group's research director, Steve Marshall: "With such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing, it's vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites."
The fact that one-in-four of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space, said Brian Jurutka, senior director at comScore Marketing Solutions. "That's a sizeable chunk," he said. "This helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise; it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites."

Journal of Travel Research study[edit]
A study by the Journal of Travel Research stated:[13]


“

While the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets, its use in the tourism industry is limited. This research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations.
Heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics. Using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations, the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies, a five star Champagne breakfast, and a room furnished with antique treasures...

Prince Edward Island study[edit]
A 2007 study on Prince Edward Island[14]


“

The vast majority of visitors to B & B are pleasure travellers. The most important reasons why travellers choose a B & B are personalised service and hospitality, price and value ratio, physical element, atmosphere, image and location.

”


TIME magazine[edit]
According to TIME magazine:[15]


“

Americans have a wide array of lodgings to choose from when they take a vacation: high-rise hotels, rustic resorts, motels by the bay. Yet more and more people are flocking to bed-and-breakfast inns, the most old-fashioned homes away from home. Just 20 years ago, there were only 1,000 B and Bs, as they are nicknamed, scattered throughout the country. Today there are more than 28,000 serving more than 50 million guests each year.
What's the appeal? Bed-and-breakfasts, often situated in elegant, historic homes, tap into everyone's fantasy of living another life. Many have been lovingly renovated with period decorations, inviting visitors to step back in time. Others carry a theme throughout the house. Since on average they have only seven or eight rooms, they offer peace and quiet, a rare commodity in the average home.
The hosts, who nearly always live on the premises, provide plenty of coddling. They will recommend local attractions, help with dinner reservations, often provide an afternoon tea or glass of sherry--and, yes, prepare a delicious homemade breakfast.
Prices at bed-and-breakfasts, which average $104 to $133 a night, depending on the region, rival the rates of good hotels. While some 10,000 B and Bs are private homes in which the owners offer a room or two, most are serious businesses, complete with websites and toll-free numbers.
The clientele tends to be couples, most of them affluent and well educated. Most are tourists or people who are in town to visit family or to celebrate a special occasion. Bed-and-breakfasts are popular with many foreign travelers, mostly from Britain, Germany, Canada, France and Australia, who have grown up going to B and Bs in their own countries.

5.0 out of 5 starsI came upon this by accidentByChutchyon October 26, 2014This is the kind of book you read curled up with a fire in the winter.  I absolutely loved Ricky and Ron and the supporting cast members.  There were some areas that I wish were expanded like how Ricky got into IT, and some other stuff, but it by no means detracted from the story.  I will truly miss reading new books from this authour, but one must do what one must do for oneself.I highly recommend this book and I wish you all the best G. A. Hauser!

2.0 out of 5 starsSkip itByanonon October 26, 2014*****probable SPOILERS, because I'm cranky*****G.A. Hauser's books are always kind of weak, but this one was exceptionally so. Many books in this genre are light, fast reads, and I've got no problem with that. If I wanted reality, I'd deal with my own life. However, Bed & Breakfast tries to deal with serious subjects (death of a partner, coming out to religious parents) and just fails.There were the common mistakes like changes in verb tense, punctuation issues, and inconsistencies in the story (for instance, Ron's partner died less than a year ago, but then it's noted that his pattern of working himself ragged in the summer and retreating for the winter to drink and mourn has been the same "every year" since his partner's death). Those problems are annoying, yet forgivable- a bad story is not. Every step in the plot is implausible, and the whole thing adds up to crap. The kid of a hyper-religious couple staying at the B&B sexually assaults the 40 year old Ron, who hasn't even masturbated since his partner of 10 years died a year ago, and Ron lets him? This guy has been running a business for 5 years and is still mourning his partner, dreaming of him almost every night, and he's going to let this twink, who refuses to show him ID but assures him that he's of age, have sex with him? No way. And then, after knowing each other for a day and a half, the kid decides he's in love, and people believe him? Other guests encourage this? He's on vacation with his parents, looks 17, yet other guests- and Ron- are going to consider this a real relationship? Hell no. I read it all the way to its painful, chiche-filled ending, thinking it couldn't possibly remain so trite all the way to the end, but surprise! It did. Don't waste your time or money.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsI really enjoyed this bookByRob K. Monteroon April 22, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining, interesting, sad, playful, warm and funny. What more could you ask for? Can I editorialize for a minute? One reviewer said GA Hauser's books are all pretty weak. Then shy is he or she reading them? A review of another book gave that book 1 star because they ordered it by mistake and did not read it. (I suspect because it had a gay theme, which they had a problem with) Why would you rate a book YOU NEVER EVEN READ 1 star, or even bother rating it all, unless you had a homophobic agenda? But I digress. I liked Bed and Breakfast and Ron and Ricky. I found Ricky's parents to be a little cliche, but I suppose there are parents out there who love the idea of what they think their children shoud be, rather than loving them for who they are. Unimaginable that any parent could disown their own child and tell him to never contact them again. Having said all that, I found this book comfortable and warm, and will be rereading it.0Comment|

At the time I didn't realize it was a romance between an older and younger man. Reminds me of myself. I'm 42 and my boyfriend is 25.Reading this story makes me want to own a bed and breakfast now. It was so sweet. And I know what Ricky feels like in the story. He and his family were from South Carolina and there is not much in this state for gay men. I am from there too. I'd love to live in the Pacific Northwest myself.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsa wonderful love story that takes place at a small B&B ...ByRichard F. Cassonon October 26, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis penultimate book by GA is, as usual, a wonderful love story that takes place at a small B&B in Oregon.  The owner, Ron, is running this highly successful gay friendly inn by himself, while still grieving the death one year ago of his partner of ten years.  Among the guests staying after the season, is a family of four, Rickey, a gorgeous 21 year old gay man, his obnoxious sister, his right wing father who is a pastor in South Carolina, and his clueless mother.  Rickey quickly is attracted to Ron and aggressively tries to have sex with him.  Ron is also very attracted to Rickey who is quite beautiful but is almost 20 years younger than Ron and is staying at the inn with his family.  Nevertheless, Ron does give in and the two of them spend a good part of the weekend having a secret and sexually hot series of encounters.  This is a lovely and simple love story that the reader should be able to sit back and enjoy;  unlike many of the books that are being written lately in the M/M erotic romance genre which tend to have horrible back stories and dangerous plot lines. You really should not miss this delightful read.0Comment|

  How to travel







            Search
          

            Airbnb hosts share their spaces in 190 countries and more than 34,000 cities. All you have to do is enter your destination and travel dates into the search bar to discover distinctive places to stay, anywhere in the world.
          










                Tools that help you search
              

                We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host's space. We've also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you’re looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you’re looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.
              



                Contacting hosts to book a stay
              

                Once you complete your profile to give hosts a good idea of the kind of guest you are, you can request to book a host's space by clicking the Contact Host or Request to Book buttons, or you can use  Instant Book to confirm your stay without having to wait for a host's approval.
              











            Book
          

            There are a few ways to book spaces on Airbnb. Some hosts want to get to know a guest before they confirm a reservation while others prefer to reduce the time it takes to manage requests by using Airbnb's Instant Book feature.
          










                Buttons to book a stay on Airbnb
              

                The Request to Book button sends a reservation request to a host for the specific trip dates you select. The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don't respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires.
              

                The Instant Book button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host's calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip's details, and your host may follow up with you, too.
              

                The Contact Host button lets you start a conversation about their space and hosting style through our secure messaging system. You can use our messaging system to discuss trip details, request special prices, or ask about specific amenities.
              



                Payment and confirmation
              

                Whether you use the Request to Book button or the  Instant Book button, we'll ask for your payment details so we can hold your reservation.
              

                If you use the Request to Book button to send a request, the host has 24 hours to respond. We won't charge your payment method until the host accepts your reservation. Once the host accepts, we process your payment and send you a congratulatory email that includes your receipt, trip details, and best wishes for a great trip. If you don't hear back within 24 hours, your request automatically expires.
              

                If you use the Instant Book button, your reservation will be immediately confirmed and we'll process your payment right away.
              











            Travel
          

            Once you know where you’re traveling and whose space you'll be staying in, all you have to do is get going!
          










                Before you get there
              

                Send a message to your host to arrange a check-in time and arrival details like picking up the key. Then  download the Airbnb app  so you can stay in the know while on the go.
              

                We'll send you an email that includes your trip itinerary, receipt, and host contact information. You can also view your reservation details, alter your plans, or cancel your reservation from the My Trips section on your personal account page.
              



                During your trip
              

                We encourage you to have the time of your life! Enjoy your host's home and city as if it were a friend's, and remember to be considerate of your neighbors. If any issues arise during your trip, be sure to get in touch with your host. In most cases, they'll be the person best equipped to help you. If your host can't solve the problem, please  contact us.
              



                After you travel
              

                Write a review about your host and their space so other travelers can learn through your experience. Your host will also have a chance to write a review for you, too. Then, pick the next place you'd love to go and find a space on Airbnb!

  How it works







            A community built on sharing
          

            Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world.
          










                Profiles
              

                No two hosts or travelers are the same, so personal Airbnb profiles help hosts and guests learn more about each other before sharing a space. Airbnb doesn't display full names or contact information on public profiles, so the community can feel confident that their information is safe.
              



                Listings
              

                From futons on the floor to castles on the hilltop, each Airbnb listings is unique. Search results feature entire homes, private rooms, and shared rooms at every price point. Hosts describe their space in detail, including available amenities and arrival and departure times, and guests leave reviews about their experience.
              



                The Community Center
              

The Community Center is a place to connect with other hosts, share stories, ask for advice, and get updates from the Airbnb team. You can also plan or join meetups.
              











            Trusted services
          

            Airbnb helps make sharing easy, enjoyable, and safe. We verify personal profiles and listings, maintain a smart messaging system so hosts and guests can communicate with certainty, and manage a trusted platform to collect and transfer payments.
          










                Verifications
              

                Airbnb puts hosts and travelers at ease with features like Verified ID and public reviews. Having a Verified ID indicates that you've completed a specific set of verifications—offline ID, online ID, profile photo, email address, and phone number. Hosts and guests also build trust and cultivate their reputations by writing reviews about their experiences after each trip.
              



                Messaging
              

                Our messaging system ensures that communication between hosts and guests stays on Airbnb so your contact information remains private until you have a confirmed reservation. For your peace of mind, we've added reporting features so you can easily notify us if you ever feel uncomfortable.
              



                Payment System
              

                Our convenient payment system supports many currencies and several types of payment and payout methods. Airbnb collects guest payments from the moment they make a reservation and waits until 24 hours after arrival before releasing funds to the host. This way, guests and hosts can feel confident knowing that Airbnb will process and deliver payments when a reservation is honored.
