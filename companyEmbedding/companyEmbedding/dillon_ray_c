GlobeNewswire



Jun 5, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































 Bentonville, Arkansas, June 05, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- America's Car-Mart Inc. (Nasdaq:CRMT) today announced that its Board of Directors nominated Ray C. Dillon for election as a new, independent director at the upcoming 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Mr. Dillon was nominated to replace Kenny Gunderman whose term is expiring. Mr. Dillon, age 61, was the President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Deltic Timber Corporation from July 2003 until his retirement in October 2016.  Mr. Dillon has over 40 years of experience in the paper and forest products industry. Prior to joining Deltic Timber, Mr. Dillon served in various executive positions with Gaylord Container Corporation from 1994 through mid-2003, including Executive Vice President from 2000 through mid-2003, Vice President Primary Products from 1997 through 2000, and Vice President Mill Operations from 1994 through 1997.  Mr. Dillon graduated from Mississippi State University where he received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering.  He also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago. Since 2011, Mr. Dillon has served as a director on the Little Rock Branch Board of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank and currently serves as Chairman of the Little Rock Branch Board. Other public board service includes his time as an independent director of US Concrete from May 2009 until August 2010 where he served on the Executive Compensation, and Nominating and Governance committees. Mr. Dillon's community service includes the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce, the Associated Industries of Arkansas and the Quapaw Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, all of which he has served as a director and chairman. "America's Car Mart is fortunate to have someone of Ray's caliber as a nominee to our Board," said William H. ("Hank") Henderson, Chief Executive Officer of America's Car Mart. "Ray's operational and financial experience and knowledge of our markets along with his desire to contribute to our efforts will be a significant benefit to us as we move forward."
