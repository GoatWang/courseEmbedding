Trading in futures and options is not suitable for many         members of the public.

the terms pursuant to which this FuturesAccess Fund shall be
governed.

trading and investing as described in the Disclosure
Document.  This FuturesAccess Fund may execute transactions in
commodity interests, currency interests, swap agreements and any
other manner of instruments, on either a principal or an agency
basis, with or through affiliates of the Sponsor (the Sponsor and
such affiliates being hereafter referred to as “Merrill

assets (in addition to the interest which Merrill Lynch will credit
to this FuturesAccess Fund’s account).  In addition, the
Sponsor may maintain this FuturesAccess Fund’s assets in
deposit or similar accounts with, or in money market funds operated
by, one or more affiliates of the Sponsor, which affiliates may
benefit from the possession of such assets, as well as with
unaffiliated entities.  The interest paid by such affiliated
and unaffiliated entities on this FuturesAccess Fund’s
cash
 
2 





 
so invested will be paid to this FuturesAccess
Fund.  However, neither the Sponsor nor any of its affiliates
(or any third parties) will be obligated to account to this
FuturesAccess Fund or any Investor for any additional economic
benefits which the Sponsor or any such affiliate may derive from
possession of this FuturesAccess Fund’s assets.
 
SECTION 1.03. 
FISCAL YEAR; ACCOUNTING PERIODS.  The fiscal year of this
FuturesAccess Fund shall end on each December 31.  This

Assets” (as defined in Section 2.04 ) shall be calculated and
reflected in the “Net Asset Value” (as defined
in Section 2.04
) of the Units
issued by this FuturesAccess Fund, shall begin: (i) as of the
day that this FuturesAccess Fund first begins operations,
(ii) as of the day that any Unit is issued, (iii) as of
the day immediately following any redemption of Units, (iv) as
of the beginning of each calendar month, and (v) as of such

SECTION 1.06. 
NON-ASSIGNABILITY OF UNITS; SUBSTITUTED INVESTORS; LIMITED
ASSIGNABILITY OF THE SPONSOR’S INTEREST.
 

(a)
          
No Investor shall
assign, encumber, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer any of
such Investor’s Units without the consent of the Sponsor, and
any assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation or transfer of
Units, whether voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, to
which the Sponsor does not consent shall result in the Units so
assigned, encumbered, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
transferred being mandatorily redeemed as of the end of the month
during which such purported assignment, encumbrance, pledge,
hypothecation or transfer occurred.  Any assignment,
encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation or transfer which shall result
in the termination of this FuturesAccess Fund for federal income
tax purposes shall be null and void ab initio and of no legal force
or effect whatsoever.  An assigning Investor shall remain
liable to this FuturesAccess Fund as provided in the Act,
regardless of whether his or her assignee becomes a substituted
Investor.

 

(b)
          
The Sponsor may
not assign, encumber, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer all
or any portion of its manager’s interest in this
FuturesAccess Fund; provided, that the Sponsor may assign such
interest to an affiliate of the Sponsor upon notice (which need not
be prior notice) to the Investors or in connection with the sale or
transfer of all or a material portion of the Sponsor’s equity
or assets.  See Sections

The Sponsor shall
have no obligation to restore any negative balance in any
Investor’s or in the Sponsor’s Capital
Account.

 

(d)
          
Except as
provided in Section 2.08 (providing for chargebacks
to current or former Investors), the Sponsor and the Investors
shall be liable for the repayment, satisfaction and discharge of
debts, liabilities and obligations of this FuturesAccess Fund only
to the extent of the Sponsor’s or such Investor’s
investment in this FuturesAccess Fund and not in excess
thereof.

 

ARTICLE II
CAPITAL AND TAX ALLOCATIONS

 
SECTION 2.01. 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS.  All contributions of capital to this
FuturesAccess Fund (“Capital Contributions”) shall be
made in cash.  Capital Contributions may be made in such
amounts, and at such times, as the Sponsor may determine.  The
Sponsor may permit certain Investors to make smaller initial or
subsequent Capital Contributions than is otherwise generally
required by the Sponsor without entitling any other Investor to
make smaller initial or subsequent Capital
Contributions.
 
Investors will receive Units in return for their
Capital Contributions.  Each Class of Units shall
initially be issued at $1.00 per Unit, and thereafter at Net Asset
Value.
 
The Sponsor (and/or any other Merrill Lynch
entity) may, but need not, make Capital Contributions as of any
date that any Units are issued.  Merrill Lynch may provide
initial (“seed”) capital to enable this FuturesAccess
Fund to begin trading before sufficient client capital has been
raised to meet this FuturesAccess Fund’s minimum
capitalization.  Seed capital (if any) will be invested in
Class D Units.  However, neither the Sponsor nor any
other Merrill Lynch entity has any obligation to “seed”
this FuturesAccess Fund (or any other FuturesAccess Fund). 
The Units may be issued in the six Classes described herein —
Class A Units, Class C Units, Class D Units,
Class I Units, Class DS Units and Class DT
Units.  Units of a new Class or series may be issued in
the Sponsor’s sole discretion.
 
Sales commissions will be deducted from
Class A, Class D and Class I subscriptions as
described in the Disclosure Document, and the net amount of such
subscriptions (after deducting applicable sales commissions) will
be invested in the Units.  The Sponsor may waive or reduce
sales commissions for certain Investors without entitling any other
Investor to any such waiver or reduction.
 
Fractional Units shall not be issued to
Investors (but may be issued to the Sponsor or any other Merrill
Lynch entity).  Investors’ subscriptions shall be used
to purchase the largest whole number of Units of the appropriate
Class possible.  Any subscription amount which cannot be
used to purchase whole Units shall be credited (in cash) to
Investors’ Merrill Lynch customer securities
accounts.
 
Provided this FuturesAccess Fund’s overall
minimum capitalization is met, there is no minimum number of Units
of a particular Class that must be sold in order for Units of
that particular Class to be issued.
 
Once this FuturesAccess Fund has begun
operations, there is no minimum dollar amount of subscriptions that
must be received as of the beginning of any calendar quarter in
order for additional Units of any Class to be issued. 
All Units will be issued only as the Sponsor may determine,
irrespective of how many subscriptions are received.
 
Class DS Units and Class DT Units are
open to investment by only other FuturesAccess Funds and do not
otherwise have any eligibility requirements except as determined by
the Sponsor from time to time.
 
Eligibility for Class A Units, Class C
Units, Class D Units and Class I Units shall be
determined on the basis of an Investor’s total
“FuturesAccess Investment” (defined below) in
FuturesAccess overall as well as, in the case of Class D
Units, in a particular FuturesAccess Fund.  An
Investor’s “FuturesAccess Investment,” determined
as of the beginning of each month, equals the greater
of:
 
4 





 

(i)            
the aggregate Net Asset Value of an
Investor’s outstanding Units in FuturesAccess (or in a
particular FuturesAccess Fund, as applicable) based on the most
recently available Net Asset Values, plus pending subscriptions;
or

 

(ii)           
an Investor’s net
subscriptions to FuturesAccess overall (or to a particular
FuturesAccess Fund, as applicable).  Net subscriptions means
an Investor’s aggregate subscriptions less aggregate
redemptions (not including pending redemptions).

 
Class A and Class C Units shall be
assigned for FuturesAccess Investments up to $5,000,000;
Class I Units are assigned for FuturesAccess Investments of
$5,000,000 or more; and Class D Units are assigned for
FuturesAccess Investments in an individual FuturesAccess Fund of
$5,000,000 or more or aggregate FuturesAccess Investments of
$15,000,000 or more.
 
Except for purposes of determining Class D
eligibility in a particular FuturesAccess Fund, the purchase and
sale of Units in an exchange shall offset each other and shall have
no effect on the amount of an Investor’s net subscriptions to
FuturesAccess overall.
 
FuturesAccess Investments attributable to
certain related accounts may be combined for purposes of
determining an Investor’s Class I and Class D
eligibility.  In addition, Investors who participate in
HedgeAccess (private investment funds which primarily trade
securities) shall be permitted to aggregate their Investments in
FuturesAccess and HedgeAccess for purposes of determining such
Investors’ Class I and Class D
eligibility.
 
There shall be no minimum FuturesAccess
Investment required to invest in Class A or Class C Units
(other than the minimum subscription amounts required to invest in
a particular FuturesAccess Fund or FuturesAccess
overall).
 
New Investors whose initial subscription equals
or exceeds $5,000,000 shall be issued Class I Units in each
FuturesAccess Fund in which they invest.  If an existing
Investor, whose FuturesAccess Investment is less than $5,000,000,
makes an additional subscription which causes such Investor’s
FuturesAccess Investment to equal or exceed $5,000,000 (including
the new subscription), the entire new subscription shall be
invested in Class I Units.  The Investor’s existing
Units shall not be converted from Class A or Class C (as
the case may be) to Class I Units, but all subsequent
subscriptions and exchanges made by such Investor shall be for
Class I Units.
 
Class D eligibility is determined on both
an individual FuturesAccess Fund and an overall FuturesAccess
basis.
 
Investors whose initial subscription to any one
FuturesAccess Fund equals or exceeds $5,000,000 shall be issued
Class D Units in that FuturesAccess Fund.  If an
Investor, whose FuturesAccess Investment in a particular
FuturesAccess Fund is less than $5,000,000, makes an additional
subscription or exchange into that FuturesAccess Fund which causes
such Investor’s FuturesAccess Investment to equal or exceed
$5,000,000 (including the new subscription or exchange), the entire
new subscription or exchange into that FuturesAccess Fund shall be
invested in Class D Units.  The Investor’s existing
Units in that FuturesAccess Fund shall not be converted to
Class D Units, but all subsequent subscriptions or exchanges
made by such Investor into the same FuturesAccess Fund shall be for
Class D Units.  However, notwithstanding the fact that an
Investor’s FuturesAccess Investment in a particular
FuturesAccess Fund equals or exceeds $5,000,000, if that Investor
invests or exchanges into another FuturesAccess Fund in which such
Investor’s FuturesAccess Investment is less than $5,000,000,
such Investor shall not receive Class D Units in such other
FuturesAccess Fund (except as described immediately
below).
 
New Investors whose initial subscription equals
or exceeds $15,000,000 shall be issued Class D Units in each
FuturesAccess Fund in which they invest, irrespective of whether
such Investor’s FuturesAccess Investments in any one
FuturesAccess Fund equals or exceeds $5,000,000.  If an
existing Investor, whose FuturesAccess Investment is less than
$15,000,000, makes an additional subscription immediately after
which such Investor’s FuturesAccess Investment equals or
exceeds $15,000,000 (including the new subscription), the entire
new subscription shall be invested in Class D Units.  The
Investor’s existing Units shall not be converted to
Class D Units, but all subsequent subscriptions and exchanges
made by such Investor will be for Class D Units.
 
5 





 
Subscriptions made to all FuturesAccess Funds
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether an Investor
is eligible to invest in Class D or Class I
Units.
 
Once an Investor is issued Class I or
Class D Units, such Investor shall continue to be issued
Class I or Class D Units (as applicable) irrespective of
subsequent redemptions or Unit value depreciation; provided that,
if an Investor withdraws entirely from FuturesAccess or a
particular FuturesAccess Fund and subsequently reinvests, such
Investor’s Class I and/or Class D Unit eligibility
shall be determined from the date of such reinvestment as if such
Investor had never previously participated in FuturesAccess or such
FuturesAccess Fund.
 
Merrill Lynch officers and employees invest in
Class I Units without regard to the $5,000,000 minimum
“Program Investment” requirement.  Such exemption
from the minimum FuturesAccess Investment requirement shall not be
generally available to other Investors.
 
Certain Merrill Lynch clients may invest in
Class I or a customized Class of Units on different terms
than those described herein, depending on the type of Merrill Lynch
Account held by such clients.  In addition, FuturesAccess
Funds may from time to time offer to certain Merrill Lynch clients
a customized Class of Units having different financial terms
than those described herein or the Disclosure Document, provided
that doing so does not have a material adverse effect on existing
Investors.  Such customized Classes will generally be designed
for Investors who are subject to additional fees on their
investments in the FuturesAccess Funds depending on the type of
Merrill Lynch Account held by such Investors or other reasons, and
shall not be generally available to other Investors.
 
The amount of each Investor’s Capital
Contribution shall be set forth in such Investor’s
FuturesAccess Program Subscription and Exchange Agreement Signature
Page.  A FuturesAccess Program Subscription and Exchange
Agreement (including the FuturesAccess Program Subscription and
Exchange Agreement Signature Page) must be completed and accepted
by the Sponsor prior to an Investor’s initial Capital
Contribution if such Investor is not already an investor in
FuturesAccess.  The Sponsor may require a new Program
Subscription and Exchange Agreement Signature Page each time
an existing Investor makes an additional Capital Contribution or
exchange.
 
The aggregate of all Capital Contributions shall
be available to this FuturesAccess Fund to carry out its objectives
and purposes.
 
No Investor shall be obligated to make any
additional Capital Contributions, except as provided in
Section 2.08 .
 
No provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as guaranteeing the return, by any Sponsor Party or this
FuturesAccess Fund, of all or any part of the Capital
Contribution(s) of any Investor.
 
SECTION 2.02. 
OPENING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS.
 

(a)
          
There shall be
established for each Unit of each Class on the books of this
FuturesAccess Fund, as of the first day of each Accounting Period,
an opening capital account (“Opening Capital Account”)
which, for the Accounting Period as of the beginning of which such
Unit is issued, shall be the Capital Contribution made in respect
of such Unit and which, for each Accounting Period thereafter,
shall be an amount equal to the closing capital account
(“Closing Capital Account”) (determined as set forth
in Section 2.06
) attributable to
such Unit for the immediately preceding Accounting
Period.

 

(b)
          
The Sponsor may,
but shall not be required to, make Capital Contributions to this
FuturesAccess Fund from time to time as new Units are issued, which
shall be accounted for on a Unit-equivalent basis and shall
participate in the profits and losses of the Units on the same
basis as the Capital Accounts of the Class D
Units.

 

(c)
          
For all purposes
of this Agreement, references to Units shall be deemed to include
the Sponsor’s Capital Account on a Unit-equivalent basis
(unless the context otherwise requires or the reference is made
explicit for greater certainty).
 
6 





 
SECTION 2.03. 
FINANCIAL ALLOCATIONS AMONG THE UNITS.  The net profits and
losses are allocated to each Class as provided in
Section 2.06
and shall be
allocated equally among the Units of such Class.  All Units of
the same Class shall have the same Net Asset
Value.
 
SECTION 2.04.  NET
ASSET VALUE.  For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the
context otherwise requires, “Net Assets” and “Net
Asset Value” shall mean assets less liabilities.  For
purposes of determining Opening Capital Accounts, Net Asset Value
shall be determined as of the beginning of, and for purposes of
determining Closing Capital Accounts, Net Asset Value will be
determined as of the close of, business on the relevant valuation
date.
 

(a)
          
The assets of
this FuturesAccess Fund shall include:

 

(i)
           
all cash on hand
or on deposit in bank or other interest-bearing accounts, including
any interest accrued thereon;

 

(ii)
          
any accrued gains
on open positions which have not been settled by crediting this
FuturesAccess Fund’s account, as valued pursuant to
Section 2.10
;

 

(iii)
         
all bills, demand
notes and accounts receivable;

 

(iv)
         
all securities
(including, without limitation, money-market funds, Treasury bills
and other short-term, interest-bearing instruments), commodity
interests, currency interests, swap agreements and all other
instruments owned or contracted for by this FuturesAccess
Fund;

 

(v)
          
all interest
accrued on any interest-bearing securities owned by this
FuturesAccess Fund except to the extent that the same is included
or reflected in the valuation of such securities; and

 

(vi)
         
all other assets
of every kind and nature, including prepaid expenses.

 

(b)
          
The liabilities
of this FuturesAccess Fund shall be deemed to include the following
(provided, however, that in determining the amount of such
liabilities, this FuturesAccess Fund may calculate expenses of a
regular or recurring nature for any given period on an estimated
basis in advance, and may accrue the same in such manner as the
Sponsor may deem appropriate over such period):

 

(i)
           
any accrued
losses on open positions which have not been settled by debiting
this FuturesAccess Fund’s account, as valued pursuant
to Section 2.10
;

 

(ii)
          
all bills and
accounts payable;

 

(iii)
         
all expenses
accrued, reimbursable or payable; and

 

(iv)
         
all other
liabilities, present or future, including such reserves as the
Sponsor may (as contemplated by Section 2.04(g) ) deem advisable.

 

(c)
          
The management
fees payable to the Trading Advisor (“Management
Fees”), the performance fees payable to the Trading Advisor
(“Performance Fees”) and the “Sponsor’s
Fees” (as defined in Section 2.05(a) ) shall be determined, and
Units’ Capital Accounts correspondingly reduced, after the
allocation of the other components of Net Asset Value, as described
above; provided that interest income may or may not be included in
Net Asset Value for purposes of calculating the Performance Fees as
agreed upon between the Sponsor and the Trading
Advisor.

 

(d)
          
Operating
expenses shall be allocated among the Units pro rata based
on their respective Net Asset Values as of the beginning of the
month.
 
7 






 

(e)
                                 
Extraordinary
costs, if any, shall be allocated as incurred in such manner as the
Sponsor may deem to be fair and equitable.

 

(f)
                                   
Organizational
and initial offering costs shall be deducted from Net Asset Value
in installments as of the end of each of the first 60 calendar
months after the initial issuance of the Units, as contemplated
by Section 2.05(b)  (for financial and
performance reporting purposes, all such costs must be deducted
from Net Asset Value as of the date of such initial
issuance).

 

(g)
                                
All Investors, by
becoming party to this Agreement, hereby agree and consent to the
Sponsor’s authority to establish whatever reserves the
Sponsor may determine to be appropriate in order to cover losses,
contingencies, liabilities, uncertain valuations and other
factors.  Any such reserves shall, unless the Sponsor
determines that such reserves are properly attributable to certain
but less than all outstanding Units, reduce the Net Asset Value of
the Units of each Class  pro rata based on their
respective Net Asset Values, after reduction for accrued
Sponsor’s Fees, operating expenses and extraordinary expenses
until such time, if any, as such reserves are reversed. 
Reserves, when reversed, shall be similarly allocated among the
Units then outstanding pro rata based on their respective
Net Asset Value (irrespective of whether such Units were
outstanding when the reserves were established).

 

(h)
                                
The Sponsor may
suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value during any period for
which the Sponsor is unable to value a material portion of this
FuturesAccess Fund’s positions.  The Sponsor will give
notice of any such suspension to all Investors.

 
SECTION 2.05. 
SPONSOR’S FEES; MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE FEES; TRANSACTION
COSTS; OPERATING EXPENSES.
 

(a)
                                 
The Sponsor shall
receive monthly sponsor’s fees (“Sponsor’s
Fees”), payable in arrears of 1/12 of 1.50%, 2.50%, 0% and
1.10%, respectively, of the aggregate Net Asset Value of the
Class A, Class C, Class D and Class I Units, in
each case as of the close of business (as determined by the
Sponsor) on the last business day of each calendar month (Net Asset
Value for purposes of calculating the Sponsor’s Fees shall
not be reduced by the accrued Sponsor’s Fees being
calculated).  The Sponsor’s Fees shall be accrued
monthly.  The Sponsor may waive or reduce Sponsor’s Fees
for certain Investors without entitling any other Investor to any
such waiver or reduction.  No Sponsor’s Fees shall be
charged to Class DS Units or to Class DT Units, unless
otherwise determined by the Sponsor.

 

(b)
                                
As contemplated
by Section 2.04(f) , this FuturesAccess Fund
shall reimburse the Sponsor for the organizational and initial
offering costs incurred by this FuturesAccess Fund in respect of
the initial offering of the Units (of all Classes combined) in
installments as of the end of each of the first 60 calendar months
of this FuturesAccess Fund’s operation, beginning with the
end of the first calendar month after the initial issuance of the
Units.  This FuturesAccess Fund shall expense such costs over
the same 60-month schedule.  If this FuturesAccess Fund
dissolves prior to the end of such 60 calendar-month period, any
remaining reimbursement obligation with respect to organizational
and initial offering costs shall be eliminated.

 

(c)
                                 
The
Sponsor’s Fees, as well as operating expenses due to the
Sponsor (including:  organizational and initial offering
costs; ongoing offering costs; administrative, custody, transfer,
subscription and redemption processing, legal, regulatory, filing,
tax, audit, escrow, accounting and printing costs; and
extraordinary expenses), shall be debited by the Sponsor directly
from this FuturesAccess Fund’s account and paid to the
Sponsor, where appropriate, as if to a third party, not credited to
the Sponsor’s Capital Account.

 

(d)
                                
This
FuturesAccess Fund shall pay all transaction costs (including
futures brokerage commissions and bid-ask spreads as well as
interest on foreign currency borrowings), as well as all Management
and Performance Fees, as incurred.
 
8 






 

(e)
                                 
The
Sponsor’s Fees, but not reimbursement payments for
organizational and initial offering costs, shall be appropriately
pro rated in the case of partial calendar months.

 

(f)
                                   
This
FuturesAccess Fund shall pay all expenses, including administrative
and ongoing offering costs, as well as any extraordinary expenses,
incurred in its operations (including the expenses of any services
provided by the Sponsor, other than in its capacity as Sponsor, or
its affiliates); provided, that this FuturesAccess Fund shall not
pay any allocable Sponsor overhead.

 

(g)
                                
The Sponsor
retains outside service providers to supply tax reporting, custody
and accounting services to FuturesAccess.  This FuturesAccess
Fund’s operating costs will include its allocable share of
the fees and expenses of such service providers, as well as the
fees and expenses of any Merrill Lynch entity which may provide
such (or other) services in the future.

 

(h)
                                
The Capital
Account of the Sponsor (if any) shall not be subject to
Sponsor’s Fees.

 
SECTION 2.06. 
ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL PURPOSES.  As
of the end of each Accounting Period and before giving effect to
any redemptions then being made, the Closing Capital Account of
each Class shall be determined by adjusting the Opening
Capital Account of each such Class as of the beginning of such
Accounting Period in the following manner:
 

(a)
                                 
Any increase or
decrease in the Net Asset Value of this FuturesAccess Fund, after
the deduction of all transaction costs and operating expenses, but
prior to accrual of the Management, Performance and Sponsor’s
Fees, during such Accounting Period shall be credited pro
rata , without any order or priority, among: 
(i) each Class of Units; and (ii) the
Sponsor’s Capital Account, if any, based in each case on the
aggregate Opening Capital Accounts attributable to each such
Class of Units and the Sponsor’s Capital Account;
provided that any amounts received by this FuturesAccess Fund from
the Trading Advisor for payment to the Sponsor shall be allocated
to the Capital Account of the Sponsor.  Extraordinary expenses
shall be allocated as the Sponsor may determine.

 

(b)
                                
If the Closing
Capital Account per Unit of any Class is reduced to zero, any
further decrease in the Net Asset Value per Unit shall be allocated
to the Sponsor’s Capital Account, if any.

 

(c)
                                 
The Management
Fee, Performance Fee and Sponsor’s Fee shall be debited from
each Class, in each case after the Section 2.06(a)  and (b)  allocations are
made.

 

(d)
                                
The Net Assets of
each Class shall be divided equally among all Units of such
Class.

 

SECTION 2.07. 
ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES FOR INCOME TAX
PURPOSES.

 

(a)
                                 
A Tax Account
shall be established for each Unit of each Class.  The Tax
Accounts of all outstanding Units shall initially be equal to each
Unit’s net purchase price ( i.e ., the subscription
price for such Unit reduced by any sales commissions) and shall
subsequently be increased by such Unit’s share of the taxable
and tax-exempt income and gain of this FuturesAccess Fund and
decreased by such Unit’s share of the items of loss or
expense and nondeductible items of loss or expense of this
FuturesAccess Fund, as well as by any distributions.

 

(b)
                                
For federal
income tax purposes, items of ordinary income and loss, capital
gain and capital loss shall, unless the Sponsor believes that doing
so would not equitably reflect the economic experience of the
Units, be allocated as of December 31 of each year among the
Units, in the following order and priority:

 

(i)
                                    
Items of ordinary
income and deduction generated by this FuturesAccess Fund shall be
allocated pro rata among the Units which were outstanding
during the months in such year when such items of ordinary income
and deduction accrued.
 
9 






 

(ii)
                                 
Gains will be
allocated FIRST, to Investors who have redeemed Units during such
year (including as of December 31), to the extent of the
positive difference (if any) between the amounts received or
receivable upon redemption and the respective Tax Account balances
of the redeemed Units.  SECOND, gains will be allocated to
Investors to the extent of the positive difference (if any) between
the Capital Account balance and the Tax Account balance
attributable to their remaining Units.  THIRD, gains will be
allocated among all Investors based on the respective Net Asset
Values of their outstanding Units.

 

(iii)
                              
Losses shall be
allocated FIRST, to Investors who have redeemed Units during such
year (including as of December 31), to the extent of the
negative difference (if any) between the amounts received or
receivable upon redemption and the respective Tax Account balances
of the redeemed Units.  SECOND, losses shall be allocated to
Investors to the extent of the negative difference (if any) between
the Capital Account balance and Tax Account balance attributable to
their remaining Units.  THIRD, losses shall be allocated among
all Investors based on the respective Net Asset Values of their
outstanding Units.

 

(iv)
                             
In the case of
each of the FIRST and SECOND allocation levels set forth in
Sections 2.07(b)(ii) 
and
(iii) , if there is insufficient
gain or loss to make the complete allocation required at such
level, such allocation will be made pro rata among all
Investors who are subject to an allocation at such level in
accordance with the respective amounts which would have been
allocated had a complete allocation been possible.

 

(v)
                                
Management Fees,
Performance Fees and Sponsor’s Fees, as well as the operating
expenses (in each case as adjusted to reflect the non-deductibility
of all or a portion of such Sponsor’s Fees and operating
expenses) and extraordinary expenses, shall be allocated, for tax
purposes, to the Investors based on the amount of the foregoing
actually debited from the Units’ respective Capital Accounts
of the Investors’ respective Units.

 

(vi)
                             
Items of ordinary
income and/or gain attributable to amounts received by this
FuturesAccess Fund from the Trading Advisor for payment to the
Sponsor shall be specially allocated to the Sponsor.

 

(c)
                                 
The character of
items of income, gain, loss or deduction (ordinary, short-term and
long-term) and of the items required to be separately stated by
Section 702(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), shall be allocated to the
Investors pursuant to this Section 2.07 so as equitably to reflect,
without discrimination or preference among Investors, the amounts
credited or debited to the Units’ respective Capital Accounts
pursuant to Section 2.06 .  Furthermore, to the
extent that this FuturesAccess Fund has a net long-term capital
gain or loss that may be subject to more than one maximum federal
income tax rate, allocations of such gain or loss shall be made pro
rata from among the amounts subject to each maximum tax
rate.

 

(d)
                                
In the case of
Units which are transferred during a fiscal year, the tax
allocations shall be made to such Units as provided above. 
The tax items so allocated will then be divided among the
transferor(s) and the transferee(s) based on the number
of months during such year that each held such Units, or in such
other manner as the Sponsor may deem equitable.

 

(e)
                                 
Having in mind
the principles of the allocations set forth above in this
Section 2.07
(to which all
Investors consent by becoming Investors), the Sponsor may
nevertheless make such allocations of items of ordinary income and
gain, ordinary deduction and loss and any items required to be
separately stated by Section 702(a) of the Code as the
Sponsor may deem fair and equitable — even if not consistent
with the foregoing allocations — in order to cause the tax
items allocated to the Investors, respectively, better to take into
account (as determined by the Sponsor) the Units’ respective
Opening Capital Accounts and distributive shares of net profit and
net loss, any entry of new Investors, any redemptions, any
differences between income for tax purposes and for Net Asset Value
purposes, the differences between the Classes
