 NEW YORK -- International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. 
    (NYSE: IFF - News; "IFF" or "the Company") announced the 
    appointment of Robert M. Amen as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive 
    Officer, effective July 1st. An experienced executive with a proven track 
    record and global expertise, Mr. Amen most recently served as President of 
    International Paper Company.
During his 26 years with International Paper, Mr. Amen, 56, 
    played a major role in developing the company's international strategy and, 
    more recently, in transforming the company's operations and business focus 
    to accelerate performance. He was named President of International Paper in 
    2003, having previously served as Executive Vice President of the company 
    from 2000-2003 and President of International Paper Europe from 1996-2000, 
    in addition to various other posts.
Arthur C. Martinez, Interim Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IFF, 
    commented, "We are delighted that Rob Amen will be joining IFF. Having 
    conducted a thorough search, we feel strongly that Rob is the right person 
    to lead IFF through its next stage of growth. Rob is a seasoned executive 
    with a proven ability to strategically manage and grow businesses around the 
    globe, complemented by significant sales, marketing and finance experience. 
    We look forward to his leadership in pursuing new opportunities for IFF."
Mr. Amen said, "IFF has a rich history of success with a heritage of 
    superior technology, product innovation and industry leadership. I am very 
    excited to be joining the Company and believe this is an excellent opportunity 
    to apply my experience to help lead a company to the next level of performance. 
    IFF has established a strong foundation on which to grow, and I look forward 
    to working with our team to capitalize on IFF's outstanding potential."
Mr. Amen succeeds Mr. Martinez, who has served as Interim Chairman and Chief 
    Executive Officer since the retirement of Richard A. Goldstein following the 
    Company's Annual Meeting on May 9, 2006. Mr. Martinez, the former Chairman 
    and Chief Executive Officer of Sears, Roebuck & Co., will return to his 
    role as Lead Director of IFF.
The executive search firm Spencer Stuart was retained by the Board of Directors 
    to assist in the search process.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWIP » Topics » Retirement Agreement with Robert M. AmenThis excerpt taken from the IP DEF 14A filed Mar 29, 2006.
Retirement Agreement with Robert M. Amen    Robert M. Amen, President, will retire from the Company effective March 31, 2006, after more than 25 years of service. In recognition of his service and past accomplishments, the Company entered into a Retirement Agreement with
Mr. Amen (the Retirement Agreement), dated March 21, 2006. In addition to the benefits described below, the Retirement Agreement reflects the exercise of discretion by the Committee pursuant to the SERP to permit Mr. Amen
to vest in his accrued retirement benefits under the SERP and retire prior to age 60. Pension benefits will be paid to Mr. Amen in a lump sum in January 2007.    The Retirement Agreement provides that Mr. Amen will receive the payments and benefits available to departing employees under the
employee benefit plans in which the employee participated at the time of departure, which results in payment upon retirement of approximately $800,000.    The Retirement Agreement also accelerates the vesting of 17,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company (and related accrued dividends). These shares represent a
portion of an Executive Continuity Award granted to Mr. Amen on January 11, 1994. All other unvested restricted stock held by Mr. Amen will be forfeited upon his retirement.    Pursuant to the Retirement Agreement, the Company will continue the medical and dental
coverage currently made available for Mr. Amen and his dependents until the earlier of the first anniversary of his retirement or the first date more than six months after his retirement that he becomes eligible for coverage under another group
health plan. Additionally, the Company has reimbursed Mr. Amen for the $50,000 deposit he forfeited to a home builder in Memphis, Tennessee, upon termination of a home purchase agreement and related liquidated damages and attorneys fees
of $34,357. These amounts were grossed up for tax purposes.    Under the
Retirement Agreement, Mr. Amen has agreed that, for a period of one (1) year from his retirement date, he will not work for, or render services to, certain competitors of the Company. The Company has agreed to delete Section 3 of the
Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement, dated March 24, 2003, between the Company and Mr. Amen, which had previously set forth the terms of Mr. Amens non-competition agreement. All payments and benefits provided under the
Retirement Agreement are subject to a general release of claims by Mr. Amen.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
   
The following is the report of the Audit and Finance Committee with respect to the Companys audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.    The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board of
Directors in its oversight of the Companys financial reporting process and implementation and maintenance of effective controls to prevent, deter and detect fraud by management. The Audit and Finance Committees responsibilities are more
fully described in its charter, which is accessible on the Companys website at www.internationalpaper.com under the Investors tab at the top and then the Governance tab on the right.    In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed
and discussed the Companys annual audited and quarterly consolidated financial statements for the 2005 fiscal year with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte), the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee has discussed with Deloitte, the matters required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, which includes, among other items,
matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Companys financial statements. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees and has discussed with Deloitte its independence from the Company and its management. The Audit and Finance Committee
has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by Deloitte is compatible with maintaining the audits independence. The Audit and Finance Committee meets on a regular basis privately in separate executive sessions with certain
members of senior management, and Deloitte. Each of the members of the Audit and Finance Committee qualifies as an independent director under the current listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.    Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Finance Committee
recommended to the Companys Board of Directors that the Companys audited financial statements be included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. The Committee has
selected and the Board of Directors has approved, subject to shareholder ratification, the appointment of the Companys independent auditor.    Audit and Finance Committee:    Samir G. Gibara, Chairman  Martha F. Brooks

THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
   The Audit and Finance Committee is
responsible for recommending the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, and has evaluated the qualifications, performance and independence of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and
their respective affiliates (Deloitte). Based on this evaluation, the Audit and Finance Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved, Deloitte as the Companys independent auditor for 2006, subject to shareholder
ratification.    Deloittes reports on the consolidated financial statements
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2005, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

Dr. Amen’s Love Affair with SPECT Scans






						Harriet Hall					
on
March 19, 2013












Share this:TweetShare on TumblrMorePocketPrintEmail 



Daniel Amen loves SPECT scans (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography). And well he should. They have brought him fame and fortune. They have rewarded him with a chain of Amen Clinics, a presence on PBS, lucrative speaking engagements, a $4.8 million mansion overlooking the Pacific Ocean, and a line of products including books, videos and diet supplements (“nutraceuticals”).  He grossed $20 million last year.   Amen is a psychiatrist who charges patients $3,500 to take pretty colored SPECT pictures of their brains as an aid to the diagnosis and treatment of conditions including brain trauma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addictions, anxiety, depression, dementia, and obesity. He even does SPECT scans as a part of marriage counseling and for general brain health checkups.
SPECT imaging uses an injected radioisotope to measure blood flow in different areas of the brain. Amen is exposing patients to radiation and charging them big bucks because his personal experience has convinced him SPECT is useful. So far, he has failed to convince the rest of the scientific medical community.
Amen has just published an article in the journal Alternative Therapies entitled “It’s Time to Stop Flying Blind: How Not Looking at the Brain leads to Missed Diagnoses, Failed Treatments, and Dangerous Behaviors.”  It amounts to poorly-reasoned apologetics with false analogies, testimonials, and pretty pictures that don’t prove what he thinks they prove.
Previous Criticism
I have written about Dr. Amen before, both on Quackwatch and on Science-Based Medicine.  Amen’s attorneys complained that my Quackwatch article was unfair; we responded to the attorneys by asking a series of questions, and I commented on their inadequate response. When you google “Daniel Amen,” “Amen Clinic” or even just “SPECT scans” my articles appear early in the list of hits.
It’s not just me. Amen has a lot of other critics. Psychiatrist Daniel Carlat wrote “Brain Scans as Mind Readers? Don’t Believe the Hype” in Wired Magazine, describing his own evaluation by Dr. Amen. Amen told Carlat his scans showed too little activity, a pattern of angst, and a predisposition to depression (that part was a slam dunk, since in taking a medical history Amen had already elicited the information that Carlat had had a short bout with depression). He recommended a multivitamin, gingko, less snowboarding, and more tennis. An expert at UCLA later reviewed the same scans and explained that the findings are meaningless because they haven’t been validated by controlled studies to determine their diagnostic specificity. Carlat likens Amen’s spiel to the cold readings of palm readers.
The Skeptic’s Dictionary has critiqued Amen’s PBS programs, calling them “infomercials.”  The PBS Ombudsman received a flurry of complaints about the use of Amen’s videos for fundraising drives, but weaseled out of taking any action by saying decisions were made by local stations and the programs were not officially endorsed by PBS.
Neurologist Robert Burton wrote an article called “Brain scam” in Salon.  The title says it all. Among other things, he is appalled that Amen claims to know how to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s.
In an article titled “Brain scans: not quite ready for prime time” Dr. Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute for Mental Health, characterizes brain imaging as “still primarily a research tool.” He cautions that “entrepreneurial zeal capitalizing on scientific advances needs to be tempered by reality checks.”
In a 2012 article in The Washington Post, Neely Tucker reported:
Officials at major psychiatric and neuroscience associations and research centers say his SPECT claims are no more than myth and poppycock, buffaloing an unsuspecting public… the disconnect between Amen’s public image and professional reputation among the elite in the field has come to defy logic.
He includes a number of scathing quotations from those elite.
Amen’s New “Flying Blind” Article
Anecdotes. He starts with an anecdote about his nephew, who had attacked a little girl for no apparent reason. Amen did a SPECT scan and found a large arachnoid cyst; after surgery, the violent behavior stopped. This is a touching story, but anecdotes are not evidence. Cysts and other brain abnormalities are frequent incidental findings on brain imaging and arachnoid cysts are often asymptomatic even when large.  Even if the child’s violent behavior was due to the cyst, a SPECT scan was not necessary to find it. An MRI would have found it, with better anatomical detail and no need for radiation exposure.
He asks,
How could a child psychiatrist know what was going on in Andrew’s brain unless he or she actually looked at how it functioned?… psychiatry remains the only medical specialty that rarely looks at the organ it treats.
He suggests that if the brains of recent mentally ill mass murderers had been looked at, their crimes might have been prevented. That might be a persuasive argument if “looking at the brain” actually corresponded to understanding what the neurons were doing or had any predictive value. It doesn’t.
He presents more anecdotes: after an addict saw the “toxic pattern” on his scan, he stopped abusing alcohol and cocaine. After a depressed patient’s scan showed a pattern “consistent with brain injury,” further questioning led her to remember a fall from her bike a month before her symptoms began.
Defensiveness. Next he switches into defensive mode, trying to answer some of the criticisms that have been leveled against him.

Scans will not give an accurate psychiatric diagnosis. He admits this is true, but argues that a diagnosis doesn’t tell us if the brain is overactive and needs to be calmed or underactive and needs stimulation. He gives another anecdote of a patient with hallucinations: SPECT scanning showed areas of increased activity, leading him to investigate further and diagnose Lyme disease. He says “In my psychiatric group’s experience, success rates increase when psychiatrists use clinical histories plus scans.” [Emphasis added.] Remember that Mark Crislip has called “in my experience” the three most dangerous words in medicine.
Not enough research has occurred. He admits that more work is needed, but switches into tu quoque mode, saying that only 11% to 14% of the recommendations of other specialties are supported by A-level scientific evidence.
Scans are expensive. He says they cost about the same as MRI scans. But the cost of an MRI varies, and only the highest prices correspond to what Amen routinely charges for SPECT. And MRIs are arguably done for reasons that are better grounded in evidence. No other psychiatrist routinely orders MRIs on every patient. And MRI scans don’t use radiation.
The scans use radiation.  He argues that CT scans do too. But CT scans are arguably done for reasons that are better grounded in evidence. They are not done routinely on every patient.
SPECT is not ready for clinical use and should be left in the hands of researchers. He argues that a useful medical procedure should not be withheld from patients just because researchers haven’t chosen to study it, and that there are no financial incentives for such research, since the imaging tools already exist. (I don’t think I need to point out what is wrong with that reasoning.)

Ignoring the real criticisms. He is really responding to a straw man characterization of what his critics have said. He ignores other criticisms like these:

Patients should not be subjected to the radiation and expense of a SPECT scan without credible evidence (from controlled, peer-reviewed studies) that it is likely to help them.
He is relying on experience and anecdote rather than on acceptable scientific evidence.
He has not validated that scans show what he claims they show.
He uses unscientific terminology like “your brain is cool at rest.”
He has not shown that his outcomes are better than those of doctors who do not do SPECT scans.
He has created his own idiosyncratic classifications of illness based on scan results, classifications that go beyond the DSM and that have not been validated elsewhere. For instance, he divides ADHD into classic, inattentive, over-focused, temporal lobe, limbic and “ring of fire,” and obesity into compulsive, impulsive, impulsive convulsive, sad, and anxious.
He prescribes inadequately tested natural remedies, irrational mixtures of nutritional diet supplements, hyperbaric oxygen, and other questionable treatments.

A riff on traumatic brain injuries. He goes on to talk about unrecognized damage from traumatic brain injuries, recommending that SPECT scans be routinely used on military personnel and those at risk of sports injuries. But he has only his own anecdotal impressions that SPECT scans can add anything useful to the usual diagnostic process for TBI, which already includes CT and MRI scans.
Conclusion
Amen fails to make his case that “Not Looking at the Brain leads to Missed Diagnoses, Failed Treatments, and Dangerous Behaviors.” He accuses conventional doctors of “flying blind.” But maybe he is the one flying blind, blinded by delusions born of exalting personal experience above rigorous scientific testing and allowing the lure of celebrity and riches to cloud his judgment. Isn’t it curious that while he claims to be at the cutting edge of scientific medicine, this article was published in an alternative medicine journal?

Amen, Daniel, M.D.
Note: this SD entry is from my blog Skeptimedia
Skeptimedia is a commentary on 
                mass media treatment of issues concerning science, the 
                paranormal, and the supernatural. 
PBS Infomercial for Daniel Amen's Clinics

...it is not possible to 
                definitively determine whether a person is anxious or feeling 
                connected simply by looking at activity in a particular brain 
                region. This is so because brain regions are typically engaged 
                by many mental states, and thus a one-to-one mapping between a 
                brain region and a mental state is not possible.*
The notion that we can use 
                cortical maps to improve our lives—romantically, politically, or 
                otherwise—forms the basis for Amen's business empire. --Daniel 
                Engber

January 1, 2009. I rarely watch 
                television news these days, but the recent missile attacks by 
                Hamas on Israeli civilians aroused my curiosity enough to 
                want to hear what the PBS folks had to say about the attacks and 
                the Israeli response. When the experts finished explaining why Israel does 
                this or that, and how Iran and Syria do this or that, and how 
                "emboldened" Hamas has become, I continued to sit on the 
                couch, sipping a glass of inexpensive red wine. Before I knew it, 
                I was watching "Magnificent Mind at Any Age with Dr. Daniel 
                Amen." After watching for about five minutes, I said to my wife, 
                "this is like an infomercial for this guy's clinics." Then Dr. 
                Amen started telling his audience, whoever they might be 
                (friends and family? hired actors?), about 
                the wonders of 
                ginkgo and other "natural" products 
                such as St. 
                John's wort. Wait a 
                minute. I've read about the latest studies on ginkgo and St. 
                John's wort. This guy 
                is still claiming that ginkgo helps with memory and with 
                preventing dementia, and that St. John's wort helps with 
                depression. The most recent scientific studies have 
                found neither of these claims to be true.  I've followed the 
                argument that favors natural over synthetic supplements, too: there's 
                no proven superiority of the one over the other. More important: 
                there's no compelling evidence that taking
                supplements is beneficial for most 
                people. (It is probably true, though, that there are fewer 
                dangerous side-effects from supplements than from potent 
                pharmaceuticals and that if one could get the same benefit from 
                a "natural" supplement as from a strong pharmaceutical, one 
                should choose the supplement because it's probably cheaper and 
                safer. But how often is that the case? Probably never. If the 
                nutraceutical is as good as the pharmaceutical it probably has 
                the same chemicals and would produce the same side effects.)
Early in his 
                infomercial, Dr. Amen touted his use of SPECT (single 
                photon emission computed tomography), a process that 
                involves injecting the patient with radioactive dye and uses 
                software that converts pictures of blood flow to parts of the 
                brain into three-dimensional, colored images. Most SPECT images 
                I've seen look like this:


 
 
 
 
 
Amen's software 
                produces some strange pictures. Here is an example:


 
 
 
 
 
 
You can view rotating 
                SPECT images on his website. Click
                
                here to view an image of a "brain on drugs." 
On his PBS 
                infomercial, Amen showed some slides of 
                (non-rotating) brains that had been morphed by software to produce "holes" 
                where little or no blood was detected flowing. He showed slides 
                of what he said were diseased brains and healthy brains. He told 
                his audience that these SPECT images helped him diagnose all 
                kinds of things. He said he's done thousands of them. I suppose 
                we were to infer that he must know what he's talking about.
Scientists are 
                reading an awful lot into brain scans these days, and much of 
                what they are seeing may have originated in their own brains, 
                confirming their biases. I had to wonder: is Dr. Amen ahead of 
                the curve or another self-deceived promoter of quackery.
I 
                wasn't fifteen minutes into this program before I was asking myself: 
                why is this on PBS? I paused the program, thanks to TiVo, and 
                did some googling before returning to the TV to find that Amen was 
                live in the studio of my local PBS station. This was fundraising 
                night and this "great show" was just one of the many "great 
                programs" KVIE brings to its Sacramento area audience throughout 
                the year. And weren't we lucky to have the great man himself in 
                the studio to promote his own program! Yes, it turns out that 
                Amen produced the program and it really was an infomercial, 
                though it was not billed as such. No PBS station anywhere had 
                anything to do with the production of Amen's program. This guy 
                is no dummy.
PBS, on the other 
                hand, looks like a dummy to me. It is because of programs that 
                feature snake oil salesmen and purveyors of woo that I no longer 
                support public television. I don't care if a station puts on an 
                infomercial, but I care if my tax dollars are used to make the 
                infomercial available to a large television audience. Why should 
                the taxpayer subsidize these programs? And why do we let PBS get 
                away with the ruse of "underwritten by" or "with support from" 
                when these are just paid advertisements by another name? Anyway, 
                Amen, Wayne Dyer, Suze Orman,  Andrew Weil, and others of like 
                ilk might draw in PBS 
                subscribers, but they make my resistance even stronger. Make 
                these folks pay for the infomercials for their books and 
                products like advertisers do on commercial television.
What I found by 
                googling Amen was that he's a psychiatrist who is promoting 
                ideas about keeping the brain healthy and improving mental 
                functioning. Most of his ideas are either so well known as to be 
                considered common sense or they are notions that don't have much 
                scientific backing. He recommends that we exercise, both 
                physically and mentally, that we not smoke or drink alcohol to 
                excess, that we eat well, and that we do what we can to control 
                the stress in our lives. Nothing new here. But then he suggests 
                that these modest proposals joined with taking supplements, 
                which he just happens to sell from his
                website store, 
                can ward off or halt Alzheimer's, among other things. You won't 
                find too many scientists agreeing with that hopeful claim. I 
                have been following the news on 
                supplements for the past fifteen years and the bulk of the 
                evidence strongly indicates that there is no benefit to most 
                people from taking supplements unless they are specifically 
                called for because of a known deficiency. My mother, who was a 
                 
                registered nurse, wasted a lot of money on vitamin C 
                tabs for our family. At the first sign of a cold, my sisters and 
                I were like trained seals and headed for the vitamin C jar.
On his website, Amen 
                says:

Amen Clinics is 
                dedicated to improving the lives of every family we serve 
                through education, the latest advances in neuroimaging, and 
                individualized treatment plans. We believe in using the least 
                toxic, most effective treatments for our patients, and use a 
                variety of interventions from natural supplements, medications, 
                dietary interventions and targeted forms of psychotherapy.
Amen Clinics Inc. 
                specializes in brain health and innovative diagnosis and 
                treatment for a wide variety of neuropsychiatric, behavioral and 
                learning problems among children, teenagers and adults. 
                Established in 1989 by Daniel G. Amen, M.D., the center has a 
                national reputation for utilizing brain SPECT imaging for a wide 
                variety of neuropsychiatric problems, including ADD, anxiety, 
                depression, autism and memory problems.

Who wouldn't want the 
                least toxic treatment? Are other doctors giving their patients 
                toxic drugs when natural supplements with no adverse side 
                effects would serve them just as 
                well? That seems to be the implication, though it's absurd. Using SPECT might be 
                innovative, but is it as useful as Dr. Amen claims?
In a book he 
                co-authored in 2004, Amen says: "Through prevention strategies, 
                you may be able to delay the onset of Alzheimer's long enough so 
                that you will never have symptoms." One of the prevention 
                strategies is early detection, for which Amen recommends SPECT. 
                For prevention, he recommends various supplements. His is a 
                rather extravagant claim, likely to give hope but rather 
                questionable. In an
                
                article in Salon.com that is very critical of Dr. Amen,
                Robert Burton, M.D., 
                writes:

"SPECT scans are not 
                sufficiently sensitive or specific to be useful in the diagnosis 
                of A.D. [Alzheimer's disease]," neurologist
                
                Michael Greicius, who runs the Stanford University memory 
                clinic, and has a special interest in the use of functional 
                brain imaging in the diagnosis of A.D., tells me. "The PBS 
                airing of Amen's program provides a stamp of scientific validity 
                to work which has no scientific validity."

Burton also 
                castigates Amen for his
                
                supplement recommendations for the prevention of 
                Alzheimer's. The recommendations seem based more on wishful 
                thinking than compelling scientific data.
What about these 
                SPECT scans for all the other things that Dr. Amen treats? He 
                uses them in his diagnosis and treatment for many disorders: 
                attention deficit disorders (ADD), mood disorders, anxiety and 
                panic disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, obsessive 
                compulsive disorder (OCD), substance abuse, toxic exposure, 
                brain trauma, memory problems, temper problems, and relationship 
                and marital problems. Yes, he treats Alzheimer's and does 
                marriage counseling. That's a pretty wide playing field. Can 
                these scans really provide vital information about these 
                disorders and problems? Can they really provide valuable data 
                regarding appropriate treatment or counseling?
To answer these 
                questions, we must look at the control studies that have been 
                done to see how effective SPECT scans are in diagnosing various 
                brain disorders. Unfortunately,
                
                the studies don't exist. We have to rely on Amen's 
                evaluation of his personal experience with thousands of scans 
                over many years. The self, however, is not exactly an unbiased 
                observer of personal experience. The potential for 
                self-deception here is enormous. A critical thinker would rather 
                see references to controlled studies than the self-serving 
                testimonials from satisfied customers that one finds on Dr. 
                Amen's website. No wonder one searches in vain to find Amen's 
                approach recommended by other psychiatrists. He truly is a voice 
                crying in the wilderness of his own making.
But, hey, Amen's been
                featured on The 
                Today Show and The View, and I predict that in 2009 he will 
                get a spot on Oprah, thereby cementing his place in the annals 
                of woo along with Dr. Oz, Dr. Deepak Chopra, and psychic John Edward. Why wouldn't 
                Oprah have him on? After all, he's been on PBS.
update: It's now almost 4 years later (Nov 29, 2012) and PBS is still featuring an Amen infomercial during its fundraising. Amen has started exercising and he's encouraging others to do the same. Can't fault that, but he continues to integrate good health advice with nonsense. And Hamas continues to shell Israel, which responds with bombs of its own. Hmm. Hamas shells Israel, Israel responds, PBS uses an Amen informercial for fundraising. Coincidence?
further 
                information
"The cost of a 
                complete evaluation [at an Amen clinic] is $3,250.00 (includes 
                concentration and baseline scans). The patients will need to 
                allow 4 days of appointments, with each appointment running 
                approximately 1-2 hours/day. For patients outside of California, 
                a phone consultation is advised with one of the physician staff 
                to determine if the Clinic is the appropriate place for an 
                evaluation. A consultation by phone will cost $150.00 per half 
                hour." There's a 10% discount for each additional family member 
                being scanned. (Dr. 
                Amen's website, accessed January 1, 2009.) 
In March and April 
                2008, "Change Your Brain, Change Your Life," another Amen 
                infomercial, "aired nearly 1,300 times on PBS stations across 
                the country, reaching more than 75 percent of U.S. television

Dr. Daniel Amen's Response to 
  Criticism on Quackwatch 
Harriet Hall, M.D.

  Daniel G. Amen, M.D.,  runs the Amen Clinics, writes books, gives lectures, maintains a Web site, and makes other media appearances. He recommends single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to help diagnose and manage cases of brain trauma, underachievement, school failure, depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, anxiety, aggressiveness, cognitive decline, and brain toxicity from drugs or alcohol. He claims to use SPECT to "re-balance a brain whose activity patterns are clearly abnormal.” He describes  SPECT as a "window into the hardware of the soul." He claims that SPECT scanning provides “guidance in the application of specific medications or other treatments such as supplements, neurofeedback, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.” 
In 2005, Quackwatch published an article in which I expressed skepticism about Amen's work.  In 2007, attorneys representing  Amen complained that the article placed him in a negative light that was unfair. Our response included questions similar to those I raised in my article. Here are the questions, the answers we received from Attorney Gayle Mayfield-Venieris of Mayfield & Associates, and my comments about the answers. 

Question: What evidence is there that patients treated at the Amen Clinics that have SPECT tests do better than patients treated by competent professionals who do not use SPECT? Has any case series or controlled trial demonstrated such benefit? 

Amen response: Amen Clinics tracks treatment response among its patients. 85% of our patients report a high degree of satisfaction with our services. We are not a typical psychiatric clinic. We typically see patients who have failed 3 or 4 other mental health professionals, and who have an average of 3.5 psychiatric disorders using standard DSM diagnostic measures. No one keeps response rates on such a complex diagnostic group, yet our results are very encouraging. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: This is an admission that there is no evidence. High satisfaction rates are not relevant to the question of efficacy. I don't doubt that Dr. Amen helps many of the people who consult him. The key question, however, is whether or not SPECT scanning is justifiable for most of them. 

Question: Are Dr. Amen's SPECT findings consistent enough that blinded observers could agree on the diagnosis from the scan alone? 

Amen response: We never make the diagnosis from the scan alone. We treat whole people, not brain scans. Having said that, we have a high degree of inter-rater reliability in reading the scans and teach others how to read them with the same accuracy. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: This admits that their scans have a low specificity, and that they are relying in part on subjective factors to make their diagnoses. 

Question: What are the rates of false positives and false negatives?

Amen response: For which disorders? Children, adults and the elderly are all treated at Amen Clinics. SPECT is a very reliable measure of blood flow and activity patterns in the brain. We always use it with clinical information. If you take our work with ADHD, we have scan patterns that predict with 85% accuracy who will respond and who will get worse with stimulant medication. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: The answer is “We don’t know.” And unless it is published for peer review, and replicated, the 85% claim for ADHD remains questionable.

Question: Have the effects of different treatments on the scans actually been compared? If so, how and where has such data been published? 

Amen response: We have published a study on EMDR and have one in the works on meditation. On Amen Clinic's Web site, we have a "medication and treatment response section" where we list many scientific abstracts concerning before and after treatment with SPECT.

Comment by Dr. Hall: Since EMDR itself has not been validated, I do not believe it is possible to use it to validate SPECT results. Before-and-after treatment scans are meaningless until they are put into perspective in a controlled study. If a scan changes after treatment, it should be asked whether other treatments or placebo might lead to the same change. Amen is claiming to base treatment choices on scans, but he hasn’t established a firm basis for those choices. 

Question: What is "brain balance," and how is it measured? 

Amen response: We measure it through before and after SPECT studies. We look for three things: (i) areas of the brain that work well; (ii) areas of the brain that work too hard; and (iii) areas of the brain that do not work hard enough. We also compare our work through a large normal database that we have. The goal is to balance brain function, such as calm the overactive areas and enhance the underactive ones. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: The statement above does not define balance or state how it is quantified.

Question: What do SPECT scans show that should change how a patient is treated?

Amen response: Many things: 

SPECT shows the function or dysfunction of specific brain regions implicated with specific problems, such as the prefrontal. cortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with getting information into long-term storage. Thus, we can target brain systems, not just vague DSM diagnoses. 
SPECT shows unexpected findings that may be contributing to the problem(s), such as toxicity, potential areas of seizure activity, or past brain trauma. This dramatically changes treatment,' such as eliminating the toxin. 
SPECT shows potential underlying seizure activity that may be contributing to the problem (often more accurately seen by SPECT than standard EEG, especially in the areas of the medial temporal lobes). 
SPECT shows specific target areas for treatment, such as an overactive anterior cingulate gyrus (seen with OCD spectrum disorders) or an underactive temporal lobe (seen in seizure disorders and other disorders such as trauma). 
SPECT shows the specific effect of medication on the brain and subsequently how to adjust dosages. Patients often report that SSRI's are helpful but also cause demotivation or memory problems. SPECT studies can show when SSRI's are causing excessive decreased prefrontal or temporal lobe activity that clinical evaluation only hints at.             . 
SPECT scans helps provide real, demonstrable answers to refractory symptoms and, in addition, helps clinicians ask better and more targeted questions—about toxic exposure, brain injuries, anoxia, inflammation, or infection, that patients may have initially denied or forgotten. 
SPECT scans help clinicians prevent mistakes or hurting patients by prescribing the wrong treatments, such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain or calming an underactive one. 
SPECT scans help to evaluate those who may be. at risk for dementia—the brain starts to change long before people show symptoms of dementia. One. study reported that there has to be a loss of 30% in the hippocampus before symptoms occur. Using autopsy data in 54 patients, Bonte reported that brain SPECT had a positive predictive value for Alzheimer's disease of 92% . SPECT scans can help differentiate between types of dementia. 
SPECT scans can identify specific areas of the brain hurt by trauma to better target treatment and help deal with insurance, legal and rehabilitation issues. 
SPECT scans can often identify a specific cause or reason that contributes to recovering alcoholics, drug addicts, eating disordered, or sexual addicts relapse behavior in their recovery from an addictive process. For example, the patient may have suffered 'an injury in the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobes or have overactivity in basal ganglia, limbic system, or prefrontal cortex, each of which could contribute to the relapsing behaviors. 
SPECT scans allow patients to have a specific physical representation of their problems that is accurate and reliable. 
SPECT scans help develop a deeper understanding of the problem and lead to decreased shame, guilt, stigma and self-loathing. They can increase self-forgiveness. Patients can see that their problems are, in part, a medical problem. 
SPECT scans help to increase compliance. The images can powerfully influence a patient's willingness and ability to accept and adhere to a treatment program as they realize they are not taking medication for their problems of anxiety, depression, rage, or ADD, but rather to optimize brain function, an idea similar to needing glasses for their eyesight. 
SPECT scans may help families understand when things will not get better, such as having permanent brain damage from an injury, which allows patients and families to accept the condition and provide accordingly. 
SPECT scans help substance abusers decrease denial and increase motivation for treatment by seeing the damage they have done to their own specific brain. SPECT scans can help motivate recovering alcoholics and addicts to continue in sobriety as it becomes clear that further use will cause increased brain damage. 
SPECT scans. physically show patients, how treatments have impacted (improved or worsened) brain function. 
SPECT scans help motivate verbally and physically abusive spouses to follow medication protocols by seeing they have a physical abnormality that may be contributing to their problems. 
SPECT scans are useful for. patients who are suffering with a "post chemotherapy toxic brain." It gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and also helps their doctors see what is physical and what might be emotional or traumatic sequelae of having cancer. 
SPECT scans allow patients to understand why specific treatments are indicated, which medications are helpful, and why certain medical interventions are chosen.


Comment by Dr. Hall: The above list contains lots of claims but little substance. For instance, do we really need thousands of dollars worth of radioactive injections and scans to “help patients understand” the treatments we prescribe? Where are the objective data showing what percentages of patients have a better outcome with this information?  This reminds me a bit of the ultrasound pictures of fetuses offered at some malls—nice to have for your scrapbook, but not medically necessary or useful..

Question: Does Dr. Amen claim that SPECT can help evaluate the patient's "soul"? If so, what gets measured?

Amen response: No. Dr. Amen uses the analogy that the brain is the Hardware of the Soul, but has never said he could measure the soul. You can read his book, "Healing the Hardware of the Soul," to get a better understanding of his thoughts in this area. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: The first chapter of the book is called "The Brain Is the Soul's Fragile Dwelling Place: The Feedback Loop Between the Brain and the Soul Offers New Answer." It claims that the brain-soul connection can "help us understand good . . . evil . . . sin. . . . love . . . hate . . . and. . . child abuse." The passage in which this claim appears also speculates that "Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi had optimal brain function" whereas "Adolph Hitler and other brutal dictators had faulty brain wiring." The book describes SPECT as a "window into the hardware of the soul." The book also promises that "clinically based brain-soul healing techniques . . . will help you optimize your brain and improve your relationships, work, and spiritual connections in the deepest ways possible." It seems to me that Dr. Amen regards the soul as more than an analogy. 

Question: Why did Dr. Amen leap into clinical applications, writing for the public, appearing on television, and lecturing about findings that most doctors would consider preliminary? 

Amen response: Dr. Amen started this work in 1991. At the time, other doctors, including academics, were using this technique, including Ismael Mena at UCLA, Nora Milne at UC, Irvine, James Merikangas at Georgetown, and Thomas Jaeger at Creighton. The American Psychiatric Association sponsored all-day workshops on brain SPECT in child and adult psychiatry. Dr. Amen has taught at the APA annual meeting on five occasions. He also started publishing on his work. The Society of Nuclear Medicine has procedure guidelines on the use of SPECT in clinical practice and recommends it for brain injury and dementia, two common uses of the Amen Clinics. Dr. Amen is a clinician and he found dramatic positive results from using the scans. Others were doing the work as well in 1991. Dr. Amen is the most visible because of his writing and speaking skills, and his ability to attract patients. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: The fact that Amen “believed” he was seeing dramatic positive results does not mean that his explanation for what he saw was correct.  It is all too common for clinicians and patients to deceive themselves. That is why beliefs should be tested with scientific studies. The APA may welcome Amen's opinions, but its current (2006) Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults Guideline states that "the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown." 

Question: Do the Amen Clinics use a consent form that indicates what uses of SPECT are experimental? If so, please supply me with a copy. 

Amen response: Amen Clinics has a general. consent form for SPECT. It states some professionals consider SPECT experimental, but many do not: Amen Clinics has nearly 2,000 mental health professionals who refer patients to its clinics. You can see Amen Clinics' SPECT Consent form in its intake packet. 

Comment by Dr. Hall: The pertinent paragraph in the consent form states:

 Brain SPECT studies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain function in seizures, strokes, dementia and head trauma. There are literally thousands of research articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our fifteen years of experience, we have developed this technology further to evaluate neuropsychiatric conditions.  Unfortunately, many physicians do not fully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that the technology is experimental, but over 1,000 physicians and mental health professionals from across the United States have referred patients to us for scans. 

This is not a fair representation of the facts. Doing research that follows a clearly stated protocol that can lead to valid conclusions is one thing. But exposing patients to expense and unnecessary radiation based on hunches is something else.  A consent form is supposed to place a procedure in proper perspective. It's true that SPECT has been extensively studied and has recognized medical uses. However, the above paragraph fails to make it clear that many (and possibly most) of the Amen Clinic's scans are taken for nonrecognized uses—such as a "general brain health checkup." The consent form acknowledges that opposition exists, but it  implies that physicians who consider SPECT experimental for these purposes are ignorant. It should state that the prevailing medical opinion does not support SPECT use for most psychiatric disorders. 
The front page of the 20-page intake packet states that the clinic does not bill insurance but provides receipts that may be submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement. I believe this statement is misleading because insurance companies do not cover SPECT scans for most of Amen's patients. SPECT is indeed approved for a few specific indications, but the Amen Clinic is using it for other indications that are clearly experimental at this stage. The policy statements of Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield of Georgia, CIGNA provide detailed discussions of what these companies considers proven versus experimental uses. 

The letter from Attorney Mayfield-Venieris also stated: 

There is no indication that Dr. Hall has any clinical experience with SPECT or any other experience that justifies her assertions or qualifies her as an expert in this field. On the contrary, Dr. Hall is a family physician and cites no references in support of her opinions. 

No, I do not have any clinical experience with SPECT, but I am as qualified as any other critical thinker to read the claims on Amen’s Web site and recognize that they are not backed up with good evidence. Experience is not an issue; I would not have to have experience practicing homeopathy to determine that it is bogus, or experience doing C-sections to determine that they save babies’ lives. Experience can even be a detriment because those who work in the field may be unduly influenced by personal experiences, testimonials, and financial interests, and sometimes it takes an outsider to see things more objectively.
It is natural to be enthusiastic about any new imaging or treatment procedure, but initial promises are not always fulfilled. If Dr. Amen’s method is not as good as he thinks, he is subjecting patients to unnecessary radiation and expense; if it is as good as he thinks, his lack of rigorous research is postponing the day when it will be generally recognized and offered to everyone and paid for by insurance. There are arguments for doing everything possible to help difficult patients before the research is complete, but there are also arguments for limiting treatment to closely monitored research settings until the truth is known.
