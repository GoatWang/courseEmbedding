Ehave And MedReleaf Enter Partnership To Optimize The Therapeutic Potential Of Medical Cannabis Products









PR Newswire




Feb 14, 2017 8:05 AM EST













 


















































    Novel mental health informatics technology offers precision to medical cannabis industry  TORONTO, Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  Ehave, Inc. (OTCQB:EHVVF), a healthcare company dedicated to empowering the mental health community with next-generation digital solutions, and MedReleaf Corp., Canada's premium medical cannabis licensed producer, today announced that the companies have entered into a partnership to develop a branded MedReleaf app utilizing the Ehave Connect mental health informatics platform to advance the study and therapeutic use of medical cannabis.  Ehave Connect enables developers, and ultimately prescribers, of medical cannabis to design and monitor treatment plans, track patient compliance, and verify treatment outcomes in a reliable and objective manner. Together, Ehave and MedReleaf seek to validate and optimize the use of MedReleaf's medical cannabis products as therapeutic treatments for various mental health conditions. Initially, the companies will use Ehave Connect to manage treatment plans and track patient outcomes as part of a clinical trial to evaluate medical cannabis's potential ability to provide relief to persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD").  Ultimately, it is anticipated that the MedReleaf App based on the Ehave Connect platform can be used to monitor every step of the medical cannabis treatment life cycle, from diagnosis and treatment planning to medication adherence and outcomes verification. Validating therapeutic dosing and administration of cannabis-based therapies, while paramount to developing new products and promoting clinical acceptance, remains a challenge, particularly in mental health indications where patient outcomes are difficult to track. Currently, the medical cannabis industry requires more clinical data for prescribers to draw from when advising patients on treatment plans, as well as reliable systems to track patient adherence and outcomes. Ehave Connect provides a suite of data-rich patient management and assessment tools that may enable more accurate and efficient study of medical cannabis and help establish objective treatment guidelines that Physicians can rely upon when prescribing cannabis therapies.

TORONTO, Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ehave, Inc. (OTCQB: EHVVF), a healthcare company dedicated to empowering the mental health community with next-generation digital solutions, today announced the appointment of Prateek (Teek) Dwivedi as Ehave's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Dwivedi will also serve on Ehave's Board of Directors. Mr. Dwivedi will leverage his 20 years of technology and healthcare leadership experience to accelerate the development of the company's Ehave Connect cloud-based platform, which is intended to provide mental health practitioners with an objective, data-rich network designed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. In addition, Mr. Dwivedi will focus on advancing Ehave's MegaTeam digital assessment and rehabilitation tool, which is currently in clinical development to evaluate its ability to assess, monitor and improve the core symptoms of ADHD.








Ehave Connect is a digital platform that clinicians can access from any computer, tablet or mobile device. It is planned to be launched initially for the assessment, monitoring, management and remediation of ADHD. To develop and grow its platform, Ehave will focus on establishing partnerships with leading mental health assessment providers that can benefit from having their products made available and seamlessly integrated for clinicians as part of Ehave Connect.
"Teek has a proven track record of developing and applying new technologies to solve important healthcare challenges," said Scott Woodrow, Chairman of Ehave's Board of Directors. "His leadership and experience at Princess Margaret Hospital, where he developed a cancer informatics platform that is successfully being used today to improve patient care, brings to Ehave the exact knowledge we need to build out the next version of Ehave Connect, which we believe can integrate objective data from multiple sources to enhance mental healthcare. In addition, Teek's tenure at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, where he directed the technology infrastructure, has been instrumental in helping to refine our product and vision. We're confident that Teek will drive innovation at Ehave, and empower mental healthcare providers with novel tools to improve the lives of patients and their caregivers."
"I am thrilled to join Ehave's team of mental health experts and software developers and together we will bring innovative solutions to the mental healthcare community," said Mr. Dwivedi. "Patients and their caregivers are often hindered by an outdated and inefficient mental healthcare delivery system. With Ehave Connect, and our other solutions now in development, we believe we will enable practitioners to make better treatment decisions across teams and disciplines while keeping patients informed and engaged throughout their mental healthcare journey."
Prior to joining Ehave, Mr. Dwivedi led Cancer Informatics at Princess Margaret Hospital at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. In this position, Mr. Dwivedi was responsible for building a next-generation health and research informatics platform designed to capture and analyze cancer patient data. From 2008 to 2011, Mr. Dwivedi was the Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, where he led the implementation of a new IT strategy for infrastructure, application, team and vendor management that was directly tied to the hospital's overall strategy to ensure clinical goals were being met promptly, embracing IT as an enabler for clinical transformation.  Before his tenure at Mount Sinai, Mr. Dwivedi was the Vice President of Operations at AudienceView Ticketing, where he managed a team of 47 engineers. Mr. Dwivedi has held key strategy and product development positions at Cascada Mobile (exit via acquisition), Casero (exit via acquisition) and Solect Technology group (exit via acquisition). Mr. Dwivedi received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

TORONTO, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ehave, Inc. (OTCQB: EHVVF), a healthcare company dedicated to empowering the mental health community with next-generation digital solutions, today announced the integration and release of the Conners 3® and Conners Comprehensive Behaviour Rating Scales™ (CBRS®) suite of assessments for ADHD diagnosis into Ehave Connect, a cloud-based, digital informatics platform designed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. Created by Ehave's partner Multi-Health Systems Inc. (MHS), an international healthcare technology developer of scientifically validated psychological assessments with products sold in more than 75 countries and translated into more than 50 languages, this initial content represents the first third-party tools and assessments to be offered digitally through Ehave Connect and demonstrate the platform's ability to rapidly integrate new partners into the platform. 








Regularly assessing patient symptoms is a critical part of the multimodal management plan for ADHD and other mental health conditions. After obtaining baseline information on the patient's impairment at school, work, or other settings before carrying out the management plan, adjustments can be made as needed as the plan is carried out. With this integration of the Conners suite, Ehave Connect will enable healthcare professionals to easily add new patients, register users such as teachers and doctors, assign surveys via the cloud, seamlessly integrate patient data, and provide secure, gated access to patient profiles limited to parents, adult patients and healthcare providers. 
Hazel Wheldon, President and Chief Operating Officer of MHS, Inc., said, "MHS is thrilled to add EHave Connect as a digital provider of our tools. The EHave Connect solution offers clients an integrated solution for connecting assessment data with other patient data to provide a seamless end to end solution."
"We will continue to integrate and validate MHS's extensive offering of clinically validated mental health assessments. The successful integration and launch of the Conners suite for ADHD is just the beginning of this process and an excellent case study for the immense value Ehave Connect can bring to patients, caregivers, mental health professionals and partners," said Prateek Dwivedi, CEO of Ehave. "Ehave is committed to providing an all-inclusive selection of validated mental health assessment and remediation tools. The seamless delivery of MHS's assessment tools alongside our MegaTeam remediation apps, coupled with our outcomes tracking is the perfect example of how we intend to streamline the mental healthcare experience, making the process simpler for both mental healthcare providers and patients."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of ADHD diagnosis in children has steadily risen from 1997 through 2011, reaching 11.0% of children ages 5-17, highlighting the need for an easy and efficient diagnosis and management platform. In addition to childhood diagnosed ADHD, a comprehensive 2006 National Comorbidity Survey sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health found rates of ADHD in adults to be 4.4%, with a majority of those cases going undiagnosed and untreated.  Ehave is positioning itself to fulfill this need for easy and efficient ADHD diagnosis, simplifying the process for both patient and provider.
About Ehave, Inc.
Ehave is empowering the mental healthcare community with a next-generation of data-rich tools designed to improve patient management, diagnosis and treatment. With Ehave Connect, Ehave's mental health informatics platform, clinicians can make objective, data-driven decisions while keeping patients informed and engaged throughout their mental healthcare journey. Ehave Connect offers a powerful set of core features that integrate with a growing selection of tools and applications developed by Ehave and its leading partners, including Multi-Health Systems ("MHS"), a leading publisher of psychological assessments. Ehave is initially focused on improving the standard of care in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD"), through its collaboration with the Hospital for Sick Children ("SickKids"). Ehave Connect is also being utilized to advance the validation and optimization of medical cannabis, through its collaboration with MedReleaf. For more information, visit https://www.ehave.com/.

Ehave Inc. Appoints Prateek Dwivedi as President and Chief Executive Officer

November 21, 2016 08:01

TORONTO, Nov. 21, 2016 /CNW/ -- Ehave, Inc. (OTCQB: EHVVF), a healthcare company dedicated to empowering the mental health community with next-generation digital solutions, today announced the appointment of Prateek (Teek) Dwivedi as Ehave's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Dwivedi will also serve on Ehave's Board of Directors. Mr. Dwivedi will leverage his 20 years of technology and healthcare leadership experience to accelerate the development of the company's Ehave Connect cloud-based platform, which is intended to provide mental health practitioners with an objective, data-rich network designed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. In addition, Mr. Dwivedi will focus on advancing Ehave's MegaTeam digital assessment and rehabilitation tool, which is currently in clinical development to evaluate its ability to assess, monitor and improve the core symptoms of ADHD.Ehave Connect is a digital platform that clinicians can access from any computer, tablet or mobile device. It is planned to be launched initially for the assessment, monitoring, management and remediation of ADHD. To develop and grow its platform, Ehave will focus on establishing partnerships with leading mental health assessment providers that can benefit from having their products made available and seamlessly integrated for clinicians as part of Ehave Connect."Teek has a proven track record of developing and applying new technologies to solve important healthcare challenges," said Scott Woodrow, Chairman of Ehave's Board of Directors. "His leadership and experience at Princess Margaret Hospital, where he developed a cancer informatics platform that is successfully being used today to improve patient care, brings to Ehave the exact knowledge we need to build out the next version of Ehave Connect, which we believe can integrate objective data from multiple sources to enhance mental healthcare. In addition, Teek's tenure at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, where he directed the technology infrastructure, has been instrumental in helping to refine our product and vision. We're confident that Teek will drive innovation at Ehave, and empower mental healthcare providers with novel tools to improve the lives of patients and their caregivers.""I am thrilled to join Ehave's team of mental health experts and software developers and together we will bring innovative solutions to the mental healthcare community," said Mr. Dwivedi. "Patients and their caregivers are often hindered by an outdated and inefficient mental healthcare delivery system. With Ehave Connect, and our other solutions now in development, we believe we will enable practitioners to make better treatment decisions across teams and disciplines while keeping patients informed and engaged throughout their mental healthcare journey."Prior to joining Ehave, Mr. Dwivedi led Cancer Informatics at Princess Margaret Hospital at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. In this position, Mr. Dwivedi was responsible for building a next-generation health and research informatics platform designed to capture and analyze cancer patient data. From 2008 to 2011, Mr. Dwivedi was the Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, where he led the implementation of a new IT strategy for infrastructure, application, team and vendor management that was directly tied to the hospital's overall strategy to ensure clinical goals were being met promptly, embracing IT as an enabler for clinical transformation.  Before his tenure at Mount Sinai, Mr. Dwivedi was the Vice President of Operations at AudienceView Ticketing, where he managed a team of 47 engineers. Mr. Dwivedi has held key strategy and product development positions at Cascada Mobile (exit via acquisition), Casero (exit via acquisition) and Solect Technology group (exit via acquisition). Mr. Dwivedi received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo.About Ehave, Inc.Ehave is empowering the mental healthcare community with next-generation, data-rich patient management, assessment, and remediation tools. With Ehave Connect, Ehave's cloud-based software platform, clinicians can make better-informed, individualized treatment decisions across teams and disciplines while keeping patients informed and engaged throughout their mental healthcare journey. Ehave Connect offers a powerful set of core features that integrate seamlessly with a growing selection of tools and applications developed by Ehave and its leading partners. Ehave is launching several digital applications under its MegaTeam brand for the assessment and remediation of ADHD, with pilot studies now underway at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids).

Ehave and MedReleaf Enter Partnership to Optimize the Therapeutic Potential of Medical Cannabis Products

Novel mental health informatics technology offers precision to medical cannabis industry













  





Ehave, Inc. (OTCQB: EHVVF), a healthcare company dedicated to empowering the mental health community with next-generation digital solutions, and MedReleaf Corp., Canada’s premium medical cannabis licensed producer, today announced that the companies have entered into a partnership to develop a branded MedReleaf app utilizing the Ehave Connect mental health informatics platform to advance the study and therapeutic use of medical cannabis. Ehave Connect enables developers, and ultimately prescribers, of medical cannabis to design and monitor treatment plans, track patient compliance, and verify treatment outcomes in a reliable and objective manner.
Together, Ehave and MedReleaf seek to validate and optimize the use of MedReleaf’s medical cannabis products as therapeutic treatments for various mental health conditions. Initially, the companies will use Ehave Connect to manage treatment plans and track patient outcomes as part of a clinical trial to evaluate medical cannabis’s potential ability to provide relief to persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). Ultimately, it is anticipated that the MedReleaf App based on the Ehave Connect platform can be used to monitor every step of the medical cannabis treatment life cycle, from diagnosis and treatment planning to medication adherence and outcomes verification.
Validating therapeutic dosing and administration of cannabis-based therapies, while paramount to developing new products and promoting clinical acceptance, remains a challenge, particularly in mental health indications where patient outcomes are difficult to track. Currently, the medical cannabis industry requires more clinical data for prescribers to draw from when advising patients on treatment plans, as well as reliable systems to track patient adherence and outcomes.
Ehave Connect provides a suite of data-rich patient management and assessment tools that may enable more accurate and efficient study of medical cannabis and help establish objective treatment guidelines that Physicians can rely upon when prescribing cannabis therapies.
“By 2024, more than 450,000 Canadian patients will be prescribed medical cannabis, creating a market worth more than $1.3 billion, according to Health Canada estimates,” said Prateek Dwivedi, President and CEO of Ehave. “This large and emerging industry is in desperate need of a technology platform to capture and deliver reliable clinical data to satisfy the needs of patients, clinicians, regulators, and payors. We’re excited to initiate our work with a company of MedReleaf’s stature and prominence in the industry, which will serve as an important first step in showcasing how Ehave Connect will be able to support the development and use of medical cannabis for the full breadth of indications where such therapies are applied.”
“Ehave Connect is perfectly suited to help evaluate the benefits of medical cannabis,” said Neil Closner, CEO of MedReleaf. “We look forward to working with Ehave to validate our cannabis therapies across multiple health conditions, especially mental health and pain conditions where treatment benefits can be difficult to ascertain.

DIGITAL ASSESSMENT AND REHABILITATION TOOLS






  





MegaTeam applications embed cognitive assessment and rehabilitation tasks within an engaging video game environment.
The Problem We Solve
MegaTeam assessment and rehabilitation products are built on established methodologies for the measurement of cognitive abilities in populations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”).
Methodologies commonly used today involve repetitive performance of tasks using a digital interface. Research has found that patients, in particular those with symptoms of ADHD, have difficulty completing the necessary regimen of tasks due to lack of engagement. Additionally, these tasks are often administered in a clinical setting, often resulting in extended time in clinical settings for the patient and their accompanying parent or guardian.
Our products have been developed to address these primary concerns as well as to enable a breadth of cognitive processes/abilities to be assessed and an individualized cognitive rehabilitation program to be administered remotely.



  












ADHD products were developed in collaboration with the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto (“SickKids”) and certain elements of the MegaTeam products have been incorporated under exclusive license from them.

PRODUCT OVERVIEW






  





MegaTeam applications seek to improve attention, learning, and behavior in individuals with ADHD. MegaTeam was designed and programmed with the intention of providing engagement comparable to video game play; throughout the design process, we have utilized experts in children’s digital media.
MegaTeam applications are available on all major platforms including PC, Mac, Android, and iOS systems. Our applications may be used in a clinic, a patient’s home, or remotely.
MegaTeam products include:




Stop Signal Reaction Time Assessment
N-Back Assessment
Inhibitory Control Rehabilitation
Working Memory Rehabilitation




We are planning to develop a broader suite of cognitive tasks and rehabilitation tools in order to expand the mental health indications served by MegaTeam.










Try us out! You can find our sample game play applications on Google Play and the App Store. These games are for entertainment purposes only and do not contain the critical functionality associated with our cognitive assessment and remediation products. To access our clinical applications, please contact products@ehave.com.

ASSESSMENT TOOLS






  





Stop Signal Reaction Time (“SSRT”) Task
The stop signal reaction time (“SSRT”) task measures inhibition of a response that has already been initiated. Impulsivity is both a facet of personality and a major component of various disorders, including ADHD. Response inhibition and impulse control are significantly correlated with ADHD traits.
MegaTeam Action Dash was designed to be a more engaging version of a classic approach to measuring response inhibition and impulse control. The MegaTeam SSRT may be of use as part of a strategy to assess ADHD; the MegaTeam SSRT may also be used to monitor progress over longer periods of time.





Contact Sales










N-Back Task
The N-Back task is  used as an assessment to measure a part of working memory. Studies have found significant lower group results for ADHD in spatial and verbal working memory tasks. Improved working memory is believed to benefit a range of cognitive skills in children with ADHD.
MegaTeam Danger Dive was designed to be a more engaging version of a classic approach to measuring working memory. The N-Back task may be used by clinicians, researchers, and healthcare providers to assess or diagnose ADHD, and also to monitor patient progress over longer periods of time.

ADHD OPPORTUNITY





ADHD is a childhood onset clinical disorder of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Current treatments available for children with ADHD are typically classified as pharmacological or behavioral/cognitive. The pharmacological agents most often used in the treatment of ADHD are stimulant medications. Although stimulant medications help remediate some of the symptoms associated with ADHD, the benefits are often limited and do not persist following discontinuation of medication.
The nonpharmacological interventions can be separated into parent training, behavioral interventions, and cognitive behavioral interventions. In general, behavioral interventions target parents or the classroom environment rather than the patient. In many cases, behavioral interventions do not remediate academic difficulties making the benefits limited and transient. Furthermore, although many theories define ADHD as a disorder of executive functions, we believe the field is lacking an evidence-based intervention which directly tackles the cognitive deficits in ADHD.
For these reasons, we believe that cognitive training will be welcomed as an alternative intervention. Cognitive training through applications like MegaTeam may:




Directly target the cognitive deficits in ADHD
Be more accessible via training in any environment
Produce performance gains that generalize
Persist following the completion of the training
Reinforce academic achievement
