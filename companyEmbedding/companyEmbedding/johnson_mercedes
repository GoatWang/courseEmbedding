Picking the right person to care for your child is tough. So is picking the ingredients that go into baby products.










 



Safety in our Products
To ensure you have peace of mind when using JOHNSON’S® products, we have spent the last two years reformulating our products. We’re proud to release improved formulas, which are phthalate and paraben free. We’ve excluded thousands of ingredients over the years based on new science and based on what you’ve told us is important to you.

Safety in our ingredients
There is a lot of information out there about talc, not all of it true, so we wanted to share some basic facts to keep you well informed.


Talc comes from rock deposits found all over the planet and is mined like many other valuable minerals, but only the highest-grade talc, meeting our purity specifications, is used for talcum powder


It is hypoallergenic, helps eliminate friction and is clinically proven to be gentle and mild for your baby’s skin.


Study data showed no increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who used talcum powder, regardless of the type of use. There was also no increase in risk among women who used powder for longer periods of time.

MSRP 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price
        ("MSRP"), sometimes known as the sticker price, is the retail price
        suggested by the manufacturer. Because the
        price is a suggestion from the manufacturer, a dealer can choose to sell
        a vehicle above or below the MSRP. Many vehicles are sold below
        MSRP.

    Market Average
 

                The 
    Market Average
 is a proprietary
                mathematical calculation based on actual recent transactions in your
                area. It provides a statistically accurate understanding of what other
                buyers are paying for the vehicle you have selected or as you have
                configured it. Adjustments to the calculation beyond make, model, and
                trim are normalized based on detailed, anonymized transaction
                information. This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold
                vehicles included different option combinations than your specified
                vehicle configuration. The data underlying the 
    Market Average
 calculation
                are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging
                process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and
                the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is
                adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not
                yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices. In all cases where
                the 
    Market Average
 is shown there is sufficient sample size and
                transaction detail to be statistically reliable.

The TrueCar Price Curve presents new car sales transaction data in a way that helps you easily recognize a fair price for a similarly configured vehicle. The vertical bars within the curve represent what people in your area have been paying for similar vehicles. Dealer documentation, administrative or similar processing fees are not included in these recent sales transactions.


A price in this range (less than 15% of sales transactions) represents an outstanding deal for the buyer, but the dealer may be selling at a loss due to aged inventory, less popular colors, demo vehicles, etc.
A price in this range (generally 30% of sales transactions) represents a great deal for car buyers.

    A price in this range (generally 25% of sales transactions) represents a good deal for car buyers.

A price in this range (less than 30% of sales transactions) is likely due to limited local inventory, high market demand, inadequately informed buyers, etc.

Regional Fees 
A Regional Fee is the fee a
                            manufacturer charges a dealer to advertise and promote the vehicle in
                            the dealer's market. TrueCar also includes manufacturer preparation
                            charges (manufacturer charges to the dealer to cover any work done on
                            the car prior to delivering it to the dealership) and fuel charges (the
                            charge for the fuel in the tank when the buyer purchases the vehicle) in
                            this total. TrueCar includes regional ad fees in its Factory Invoice
                            calculations; other sites sometimes do not.

Customer Incentives



Customer Incentives 
Customer incentives are
                            also commonly known as customer cash or bonus incentives. These
                            incentives are offered by manufacturers as a way of enticing buyers into
                            purchasing a vehicle. Since the manufacturer is passing on the customer
                            incentive to the buyer, TrueCar factors it into the Average Paid
                            price.

    Market Average





    Market Average
 

                The 
    Market Average
 is a proprietary
                mathematical calculation based on actual recent transactions in your
                area. It provides a statistically accurate understanding of what other
                buyers are paying for the vehicle you have selected or as you have
                configured it. Adjustments to the calculation beyond make, model, and
                trim are normalized based on detailed, anonymized transaction
                information. This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold
                vehicles included different option combinations than your specified
                vehicle configuration. The data underlying the 
    Market Average
 calculation
                are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging
                process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and
                the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is
                adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not
                yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices. In all cases where
                the 
    Market Average
 is shown there is sufficient sample size and
                transaction detail to be statistically reliable.

"Ahmed and Vivid Racing were great. I purchased a pair of Recaro seats with all the necessary hardware as well as Schroth Harnesses for my GTI. Ahmed was patient with me and my questions and gave me a great deal and I am grateful. There were issues with Recaro's availability for the seats and took 3 months to receive, but at no fault of Vivid Racing or Ahmed directly. I would and will likely purchase from Vivid again in the future."

MSRP 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price
        ("MSRP"), sometimes known as the sticker price, is the retail price
        suggested by the manufacturer. Because the
        price is a suggestion from the manufacturer, a dealer can choose to sell
        a vehicle above or below the MSRP. Many vehicles are sold below
        MSRP.

    Market Average
 
    



    Market Average
 

                The 
    Market Average
 is a proprietary
                mathematical calculation based on actual recent transactions in your
                area. It provides a statistically accurate understanding of what other
                buyers are paying for the vehicle you have selected or as you have
                configured it. Adjustments to the calculation beyond make, model, and
                trim are normalized based on detailed, anonymized transaction
                information. This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold
                vehicles included different option combinations than your specified
                vehicle configuration. The data underlying the 
    Market Average
 calculation
                are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging
                process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and
                the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is
                adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not
                yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices. In all cases where
                the 
    Market Average
 is shown there is sufficient sample size and
                transaction detail to be statistically reliable.

The TrueCar Price Curve presents new car sales transaction data in a way that helps you easily recognize a fair price for a similarly configured vehicle. The vertical bars within the curve represent what people in your area have been paying for similar vehicles. Dealer documentation, administrative or similar processing fees are not included in these recent sales transactions.


A price in this range (less than 15% of sales transactions) represents an outstanding deal for the buyer, but the dealer may be selling at a loss due to aged inventory, less popular colors, demo vehicles, etc.
A price in this range (generally 30% of sales transactions) represents a great deal for car buyers.

    A price in this range (generally 25% of sales transactions) represents a good deal for car buyers.

A price in this range (less than 30% of sales transactions) is likely due to limited local inventory, high market demand, inadequately informed buyers, etc.






                                The TrueCar Range is up to $ below MSRP.

Many vehicles are sold below MSRP.

Factory Invoice
                        
    


Factory Invoice 
Factory Invoice is the amount
                            that a manufacturer initially charges the dealer for a vehicle,
                            including destination fees, regional ad fees and other fees charged to
                            the dealer by the manufacturer. This price does not include discounts,
                            dealer incentives, or holdbacks (money allocated back to the dealer from
                            the manufacturer upon sale).




    Market Average

                        
    



    Market Average
 

                The 
    Market Average
 is a proprietary
                mathematical calculation based on actual recent transactions in your
                area. It provides a statistically accurate understanding of what other
                buyers are paying for the vehicle you have selected or as you have
                configured it. Adjustments to the calculation beyond make, model, and
                trim are normalized based on detailed, anonymized transaction
                information. This accounts for the fact that most or all recently-sold
                vehicles included different option combinations than your specified
                vehicle configuration. The data underlying the 
    Market Average
 calculation
                are filtered for extreme outliers and subjected to a weighted averaging
                process that considers factors such as the recency of transactions and
                the timing of data lags. In certain instances, the calculated result is
                adjusted to take account of abrupt changes in the market that may not
                yet be fully reflected by recent transaction prices. In all cases where
                the 
    Market Average
 is shown there is sufficient sample size and
                transaction detail to be statistically reliable.
            



MSRP
                        
    
    


MSRP 
The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price
        ("MSRP"), sometimes known as the sticker price, is the retail price
        suggested by the manufacturer. Because the
        price is a suggestion from the manufacturer, a dealer can choose to sell
        a vehicle above or below the MSRP. Many vehicles are sold below
        MSRP.







Base
                        
    


Base Vehicle 
The base vehicle is the vehicle
                            before any optional equipment or destination fees have been added. All
                            of the standard features are included in the base vehicle.

Options 
This is the total charge for all
                            optional equipment included in the configuration of your virtual
                            vehicle. The Options charge varies depending on whether it is calculated
                            based on the Factory Invoice or MSRP. Options are not included in the
                            base vehicle price and are not considered standard features.

Regional Fees
                        
    


Regional Fees 
A Regional Fee is the fee a
                            manufacturer charges a dealer to advertise and promote the vehicle in
                            the dealer's market. TrueCar also includes manufacturer preparation
                            charges (manufacturer charges to the dealer to cover any work done on
                            the car prior to delivering it to the dealership) and fuel charges (the
                            charge for the fuel in the tank when the buyer purchases the vehicle) in
                            this total. TrueCar includes regional ad fees in its Factory Invoice
                            calculations; other sites sometimes do not.

Destination Fees
                        
    


Destination Fees 
These are the amounts that
                            manufacturers charge to deliver a vehicle from the factory to
                            the dealership.

Customer Incentives



Customer Incentives 
Customer incentives are
                            also commonly known as customer cash or bonus incentives. These
                            incentives are offered by manufacturers as a way of enticing buyers into
                            purchasing a vehicle. Since the manufacturer is passing on the customer
                            incentive to the buyer, TrueCar factors it into the Average Paid
                            price.

Dave Johnson is a pioneer in this industry.  He is driven to success by doing things differently than anyone else, yet experiencing greater success than his competitors.  

Dave is a natural born leader possessing the skills to extract the true potential from anyone who is willing to exceed their own expectations.  Mr. Johnson has never accepted defeat and expects the same of his team and pupils.. He is relentless in his pursuit of the next biggest deal!  

I had the pleasure of learning and working under Dave Johnson and the experiences I gained watching such an amazing person, professional salesman and respected friend can never be expressed in words on a message board.  

Mr. David Johnson is unique in his methods and for those whom have had the pleasure to work for him, with him or against him, I am sure, without a doubt, you are better for having the experience.

I`ve know Dave for almost 20 years and I hope I will somehow impact peoples lives as much as he has, in such an inspiring and positive way!See moreSee lessDuring my time as Director of Sales for EKI it was my pleasure to get to know Dave Johnson as one of the most knowledgeable and hard working individuals in our, or any, industry.  There is no doubt in my mind that Mercedes Medical's growth to being a highly regarded and respected supplier to the histology laboratory is due in very large part to Dave's efforts. 

While many other sales managers generally seemed content to take orders from their existing customer base, Dave was among a very few whom I could trust to develop and win new customers based on sales leads I was able to generate.  If he were able to bottle and share his limitless energy we'd all be better at what we do.  Dave Johnson's work ethic sets a standard to which all aspire but very few approach, let alone attain.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended David DesmondGroupsADVANCE for Administrators of the LaboratoryMedical Device OpportunityNational Association of Scientific Materials ManagersCardiovascular Medical Devices GroupMedCepts Medical Sales NetworkGroup Purchasing Organizations (GPOs)Pathology Laboratory Management ConsultantsSee 7 moreHealthcare SuppliersLab Equipment Group (LEG)BMETS LOOKING FOR WORKMedical Sales DistributorsCenters for Medicare & Medicaid ServicesMedical Device Distributors and Independent RepresentativesAnatomic Pathology ProfessionalsSee lessView David Desmond’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David Desmond directlyView David Desmond’s Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishGermanChinese (Simplified)People Also ViewedDavid CarsonVice President at Tanner ScientificBill ButerbaughSales Executive at Mercedes Medical, Inc.Corey HubbardPathology Equipment | Laboratory Equipment | Serving Cancer Research Facilities, Diagnostic Facilities, and others!Charley NicholsCEO at The Charley Nichols CompanyAllison EckebrechtConsultant for Toxicology and Specialized Services for Addiction ProfessionalsJayson ColbyDirector, NE Lab Operations at U.

Johnson Controls Supplies Mercedes S-Class


December 17, 2013  by John Day    





Johnson Controls is supplying key components for the front seats and optional Executive rear seats, the rear-seat entertainment system, the headliner and the sun visors in the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class.
Both the driver and front-seat passenger have 10 options for individual front-seat configuration according to stature and preferred sitting position, and an optional Memory package for saving the seat positions.
The seat adjustment mechanisms and motors boast a compact, lightweight design. In order to adjust the seat height by 65 millimeters, Johnson Controls has come up with a new tandem solution.
The patented, specially mounted actuator limits the forward adjustment range of the cushion base to only half, while lengthening the complete seat cushion and adapting the suspension to suit the size and weight of the passenger. This saves the driver and front-seat passenger from having to shift the seat again after adjusting the seat height. Depending on the model, the Johnson Controls head restraints can be adjusted electronically both vertically and horizontally.
For the optional Executive seats in the rear, Johnson Controls developed flexible individual seat structures including special adjustment mechanisms and motors.
A most upright backrest position of 19 degrees can be achieved for working purposes. The backrest of the Executive seats can also be adjusted rearwards, giving it the largest inclination in the executive segment and enabling a torso angle of up to 43.5 degrees. In addition, the seat behind the front passenger seat can be fitted with a calf support, which is adjustable in length, and an all-new heel rest.
If the optional Chauffeur package is ordered, the structure of the front passenger seat supplied by Johnson Controls also enables it to be placed in an extended-recline position for the rear-seat passenger behind. Thanks to Johnson Controls’ patented height adjustment, the reclined front passenger seat can be brought level with the rear reclining seat at the touch of a button. The folding head restraint for the passenger seat was designed to be completely removed.
Johnson Controls has also designed the optional entertainment system for the rear of the new luxury sedan. The two 10.2-inch TFT screens are mounted on the front-seat backrests. Unlike systems that are integrated into the backrest, rear-seat passengers can individually adjust the position of the displays.
The 16:9 format can be comfortably enjoyed at a viewing angle of up to 160 degrees. If the backrest of the front seat is adjusted, an interface integrated into the passenger seat automatically adjusts the position of the screen. The position of the screen on the driver’s seat is adjusted manually. Rear-seat passengers can control the entertainment system themselves and make full use of the radio, TV, internet, navigation system and DVD player. A light sensor automatically adjusts the brightness of the quarter high-definition (qHD) displays in the vehicle interior. Headphones ensure an uninterrupted audio experience.

JOHNSON’S®: Here For You
At JOHNSON’S® Baby, we care about your baby, and we care what we put in your favorite products. Each ingredient is carefully tested to make sure we’re giving you what you need, and nothing else.









 



Ingredients
We know long lists of scientific names can be confusing and overwhelming. We’re here to make it make sense.











EXPLORE INGREDIENTS







 






 



Safety Standards
We don’t let any product go to stores without ensuring that it’s safe and effective for your baby. Promise.











READ SAFETY STANDARDS







 





What’s the Latest in Ingredients and Products:
We will never stop innovating to maintain the highest standards in our ingredients and products. Here’s the latest regarding ingredients and industry safety standards:

Morning Routine | JOHNSON’S®
Babyproofing your house doesn’t make life easier. But it does make it safer. At Johnson’s, we care about safety as much as you do.

Sitters Interview | JOHNSON’S®
Picking the right person to care for your child is tough. So is picking the ingredients that go into baby products.










 



Safety in our Products
To ensure you have peace of mind when using JOHNSON’S® products, we have spent the last two years reformulating our products. We’re proud to release improved formulas, which are phthalate and paraben free. We’ve excluded thousands of ingredients over the years based on new science and based on what you’ve told us is important to you.

Safety in our ingredients
There is a lot of information out there about talc, not all of it true, so we wanted to share some basic facts to keep you well informed.


Talc comes from rock deposits found all over the planet and is mined like many other valuable minerals, but only the highest-grade talc, meeting our purity specifications, is used for talcum powder


It is hypoallergenic, helps eliminate friction and is clinically proven to be gentle and mild for your baby’s skin.


Study data showed no increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who used talcum powder, regardless of the type of use. There was also no increase in risk among women who used powder for longer periods of time.

Testimonials





I know what goes into the development of our products, the time, the giant team of experts, the care. Not just in selecting the best ingredients for babies, but the effort that goes into the whole process to meet the high standards we follow. That’s why I’ve always had JOHNSON’S® products in our home, both for myself and for my kids.
Janet Nikolovski, Ph.D. Associate Director and Fellow JOHNSON’S® Baby Research & Development. Mother to twins.
