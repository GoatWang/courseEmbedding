History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Nordstrom
Early history[edit]




Nordstrom's headquarters and flagship store (in former Frederick & Nelson flagship) in downtown Seattle.


In 1887, at the age of 16, like many other Swedes in the late 19th century, John W. Nordstrom emigrated to the United States in search of opportunity. He was born in the village of Alvik, close to the city of Luleå in Northern Sweden. His name at birth was "Johan Nordström" which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan. As he moved across the country, he worked a series of menial jobs. He was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington, near Seattle. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory, leaving Seattle. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[1] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson and looked for a business venture, finally settling on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W.(1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom. By the time Wallin & Nordstrom opened their second store in Seattle in 1923, Elmer, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had enough experience to be placed in charge of its opening.[1]

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[7]
By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963. The company's name was changed to Nordstrom Absolute Best in 1969.[1]
By 1968, the second generation debated selling the company as Everett neared retirement. Instead, they were convinced by the third-generation Nordstroms—Bruce A. (Everett's son), James F. and John N. (Elmer's two sons), together with John A. (Jack) MacMillan (married to Lloyd's daughter) -- to take the company public instead, and allow the cousins to take over the business. In 1971, the company was taken public on NASDAQ under the ticker NOBE (Nordstrom Best). In 1973, "Best" was dropped from the company's name, and the store assumed its current name of Nordstrom.[8] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[1]
1970s–90s[edit]

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[9] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[10]
In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[11] The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[12] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.
Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. Other rewards include Nordstrom Notes which are redeemed or used like cash in stores for new purchases and the Nordstrom Signature VISA card also has an optional travel/leisure rewards feature. The Nordstrom Rewards program features 4 levels of status depending on annual spending and offers various promotional times throughout the year to earn double, triple and even ten-times points.[13][14]
Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins served as co-presidents for a time. After John Whitacre served as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997,[15] in 2001 the family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[16]
In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).
2000–2015[edit]




Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price clearance store


Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[17]




A Nordstrom Rack store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."[18]
In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger, more free-willed sister of the typical Nordstrom customer.[19]
Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[20] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[21]
On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom confirmed a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. To be located at the Ridgedale Center, it would be the second in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1991, Nordstrom has sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[22] Plans were originally made in 2007 to open at Ridgedale Center in 2011, only to be canceled in 2009.[23] It opened in September 2015.
Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[24] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[25] The company plans to open its first namesake store in New York City in 2019.[1][26]
2016–present[edit]
In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[27][28]
In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[29][30][31][32] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations. Stations would include products from Origins, Tata Harper, and Bare Minerals.[33]
On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[34][35] President Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving "tweet curse".[36][37][38][39]
Expansion into Canada[edit]
The Calgary store opened in Chinook Centre on September 19, 2014,[40] the Ottawa store opened in Rideau Centre on March 6, 2015,[41] the Vancouver Pacific Centre store opened on September 18, 2015,[42] and the Toronto Eaton Centre in 2016. Later in 2016, a second Toronto location was opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21, 2016.[43] Additionally, a third Toronto store in Sherway Gardens is currently under construction for a planned opening in the fall of 2017.[44][45] The first Nordstrom Rack in the country is to open in Toronto during 2018.[46]
Puerto Rico[edit]
Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[47]
Sales events[edit]




Map of Nordstrom locations in the United States


Nordstrom holds six designated sale events each year. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales.
Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[48] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at a large discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom rewards members are able to make appointments with sales associates to shop the sale early through the store's Early Access event.[49]
Recognition[edit]
Nordstrom was listed at No. 72 in Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009.[50] Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame member of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list.[51] Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005.[52] For the 20th year in a row, they made the list coming in at No. 94 in 2017.[53][54] In 2010, it ranked number 53, and dropped to 61 in 2012.[55] Nordstrom was ranked No. 286, previously 293, on the Fortune 500 for 2007 and in 2015 ranked 224.[56][57]
in December 2013, Women's Wear Daily (WWD) reported Nordstrom as the top fashion retailer.[58]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Nordstrom
Early history[edit]




Nordstrom's headquarters and flagship store (in former Frederick & Nelson flagship) in downtown Seattle.


In 1887, at the age of 16, like many other Swedes in the late 19th century, John W. Nordstrom emigrated to the United States in search of opportunity. He was born in the village of Alvik, close to the city of Luleå in Northern Sweden. His name at birth was "Johan Nordström" which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan. As he moved across the country, he worked a series of menial jobs. He was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington, near Seattle. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory, leaving Seattle. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[1] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson and looked for a business venture, finally settling on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W.(1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom. By the time Wallin & Nordstrom opened their second store in Seattle in 1923, Elmer, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had enough experience to be placed in charge of its opening.[1]

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[7]
By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963. The company's name was changed to Nordstrom Absolute Best in 1969.[1]
By 1968, the second generation debated selling the company as Everett neared retirement. Instead, they were convinced by the third-generation Nordstroms—Bruce A. (Everett's son), James F. and John N. (Elmer's two sons), together with John A. (Jack) MacMillan (married to Lloyd's daughter) -- to take the company public instead, and allow the cousins to take over the business. In 1971, the company was taken public on NASDAQ under the ticker NOBE (Nordstrom Best). In 1973, "Best" was dropped from the company's name, and the store assumed its current name of Nordstrom.[8] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[1]
1970s–90s[edit]

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[9] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[10]
In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[11] The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[12] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.
Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. Other rewards include Nordstrom Notes which are redeemed or used like cash in stores for new purchases and the Nordstrom Signature VISA card also has an optional travel/leisure rewards feature. The Nordstrom Rewards program features 4 levels of status depending on annual spending and offers various promotional times throughout the year to earn double, triple and even ten-times points.[13][14]
Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins served as co-presidents for a time. After John Whitacre served as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997,[15] in 2001 the family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[16]
In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).
2000–2015[edit]




Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price clearance store


Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[17]




A Nordstrom Rack store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."[18]
In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger, more free-willed sister of the typical Nordstrom customer.[19]
Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[20] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[21]
On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom confirmed a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. To be located at the Ridgedale Center, it would be the second in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1991, Nordstrom has sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[22] Plans were originally made in 2007 to open at Ridgedale Center in 2011, only to be canceled in 2009.[23] It opened in September 2015.
Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[24] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[25] The company plans to open its first namesake store in New York City in 2019.[1][26]
2016–present[edit]
In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[27][28]
In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[29][30][31][32] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations. Stations would include products from Origins, Tata Harper, and Bare Minerals.[33]
On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[34][35] President Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving "tweet curse".[36][37][38][39]
Expansion into Canada[edit]
The Calgary store opened in Chinook Centre on September 19, 2014,[40] the Ottawa store opened in Rideau Centre on March 6, 2015,[41] the Vancouver Pacific Centre store opened on September 18, 2015,[42] and the Toronto Eaton Centre in 2016. Later in 2016, a second Toronto location was opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21, 2016.[43] Additionally, a third Toronto store in Sherway Gardens is currently under construction for a planned opening in the fall of 2017.[44][45] The first Nordstrom Rack in the country is to open in Toronto during 2018.[46]
Puerto Rico[edit]
Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[47]
Sales events[edit]




Map of Nordstrom locations in the United States


Nordstrom holds six designated sale events each year. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales.
Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[48] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at a large discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom rewards members are able to make appointments with sales associates to shop the sale early through the store's Early Access event.[49]
Recognition[edit]
Nordstrom was listed at No. 72 in Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009.[50] Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame member of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list.[51] Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005.[52] For the 20th year in a row, they made the list coming in at No. 94 in 2017.[53][54] In 2010, it ranked number 53, and dropped to 61 in 2012.[55] Nordstrom was ranked No. 286, previously 293, on the Fortune 500 for 2007 and in 2015 ranked 224.[56][57]
in December 2013, Women's Wear Daily (WWD) reported Nordstrom as the top fashion retailer.[58]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Nordstrom
Early history[edit]




Nordstrom's headquarters and flagship store (in former Frederick & Nelson flagship) in downtown Seattle.


In 1887, at the age of 16, like many other Swedes in the late 19th century, John W. Nordstrom emigrated to the United States in search of opportunity. He was born in the village of Alvik, close to the city of Luleå in Northern Sweden. His name at birth was "Johan Nordström" which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan. As he moved across the country, he worked a series of menial jobs. He was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington, near Seattle. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory, leaving Seattle. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[1] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson and looked for a business venture, finally settling on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W.(1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom. By the time Wallin & Nordstrom opened their second store in Seattle in 1923, Elmer, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had enough experience to be placed in charge of its opening.[1]

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[7]
By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963. The company's name was changed to Nordstrom Absolute Best in 1969.[1]
By 1968, the second generation debated selling the company as Everett neared retirement. Instead, they were convinced by the third-generation Nordstroms—Bruce A. (Everett's son), James F. and John N. (Elmer's two sons), together with John A. (Jack) MacMillan (married to Lloyd's daughter) -- to take the company public instead, and allow the cousins to take over the business. In 1971, the company was taken public on NASDAQ under the ticker NOBE (Nordstrom Best). In 1973, "Best" was dropped from the company's name, and the store assumed its current name of Nordstrom.[8] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[1]
1970s–90s[edit]

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[9] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[10]
In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[11] The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[12] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.
Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. Other rewards include Nordstrom Notes which are redeemed or used like cash in stores for new purchases and the Nordstrom Signature VISA card also has an optional travel/leisure rewards feature. The Nordstrom Rewards program features 4 levels of status depending on annual spending and offers various promotional times throughout the year to earn double, triple and even ten-times points.[13][14]
Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins served as co-presidents for a time. After John Whitacre served as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997,[15] in 2001 the family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[16]
In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).
2000–2015[edit]




Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price clearance store


Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[17]

On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."[18]
In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger, more free-willed sister of the typical Nordstrom customer.[19]
Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[20] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[21]
On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom confirmed a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. To be located at the Ridgedale Center, it would be the second in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1991, Nordstrom has sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[22] Plans were originally made in 2007 to open at Ridgedale Center in 2011, only to be canceled in 2009.[23] It opened in September 2015.
Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[24] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[25] The company plans to open its first namesake store in New York City in 2019.[1][26]
2016–present[edit]
In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[27][28]
In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[29][30][31][32] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations. Stations would include products from Origins, Tata Harper, and Bare Minerals.[33]
On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[34][35] President Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving "tweet curse".[36][37][38][39]
Expansion into Canada[edit]
The Calgary store opened in Chinook Centre on September 19, 2014,[40] the Ottawa store opened in Rideau Centre on March 6, 2015,[41] the Vancouver Pacific Centre store opened on September 18, 2015,[42] and the Toronto Eaton Centre in 2016. Later in 2016, a second Toronto location was opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21, 2016.[43] Additionally, a third Toronto store in Sherway Gardens is currently under construction for a planned opening in the fall of 2017.[44][45] The first Nordstrom Rack in the country is to open in Toronto during 2018.[46]
Puerto Rico[edit]
Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[47]
Sales events[edit]




Map of Nordstrom locations in the United States


Nordstrom holds six designated sale events each year. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales.
Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[48] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at a large discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom rewards members are able to make appointments with sales associates to shop the sale early through the store's Early Access event.[49]
Recognition[edit]
Nordstrom was listed at No. 72 in Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009.[50] Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame member of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list.[51] Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005.[52] For the 20th year in a row, they made the list coming in at No. 94 in 2017.[53][54] In 2010, it ranked number 53, and dropped to 61 in 2012.[55] Nordstrom was ranked No. 286, previously 293, on the Fortune 500 for 2007 and in 2015 ranked 224.[56][57]
in December 2013, Women's Wear Daily (WWD) reported Nordstrom as the top fashion retailer.[58]

History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Nordstrom
Early history[edit]




Nordstrom's headquarters and flagship store (in former Frederick & Nelson flagship) in downtown Seattle.


In 1887, at the age of 16, like many other Swedes in the late 19th century, John W. Nordstrom emigrated to the United States in search of opportunity. He was born in the village of Alvik, close to the city of Luleå in Northern Sweden. His name at birth was "Johan Nordström" which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan. As he moved across the country, he worked a series of menial jobs. He was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington, near Seattle. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory, leaving Seattle. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[1] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson and looked for a business venture, finally settling on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W.(1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom. By the time Wallin & Nordstrom opened their second store in Seattle in 1923, Elmer, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had enough experience to be placed in charge of its opening.[1]

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[7]
By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963. The company's name was changed to Nordstrom Absolute Best in 1969.[1]
By 1968, the second generation debated selling the company as Everett neared retirement. Instead, they were convinced by the third-generation Nordstroms—Bruce A. (Everett's son), James F. and John N. (Elmer's two sons), together with John A. (Jack) MacMillan (married to Lloyd's daughter) -- to take the company public instead, and allow the cousins to take over the business. In 1971, the company was taken public on NASDAQ under the ticker NOBE (Nordstrom Best). In 1973, "Best" was dropped from the company's name, and the store assumed its current name of Nordstrom.[8] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[1]
1970s–90s[edit]

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[9] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[10]
In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[11] The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[12] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.
Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. Other rewards include Nordstrom Notes which are redeemed or used like cash in stores for new purchases and the Nordstrom Signature VISA card also has an optional travel/leisure rewards feature. The Nordstrom Rewards program features 4 levels of status depending on annual spending and offers various promotional times throughout the year to earn double, triple and even ten-times points.[13][14]
Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins served as co-presidents for a time. After John Whitacre served as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997,[15] in 2001 the family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[16]
In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2).
2000–2015[edit]




Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price clearance store


Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[17]




A Nordstrom Rack store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."[18]
In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger, more free-willed sister of the typical Nordstrom customer.[19]
Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[20] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[21]
On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom confirmed a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. To be located at the Ridgedale Center, it would be the second in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1991, Nordstrom has sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[22] Plans were originally made in 2007 to open at Ridgedale Center in 2011, only to be canceled in 2009.[23] It opened in September 2015.
Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[24] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[25] The company plans to open its first namesake store in New York City in 2019.[1][26]
2016–present[edit]
In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[27][28]
In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[29][30][31][32] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations. Stations would include products from Origins, Tata Harper, and Bare Minerals.[33]
On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[34][35] President Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving "tweet curse".[36][37][38][39]
Expansion into Canada[edit]
The Calgary store opened in Chinook Centre on September 19, 2014,[40] the Ottawa store opened in Rideau Centre on March 6, 2015,[41] the Vancouver Pacific Centre store opened on September 18, 2015,[42] and the Toronto Eaton Centre in 2016. Later in 2016, a second Toronto location was opened at Yorkdale Shopping Centre on October 21, 2016.[43] Additionally, a third Toronto store in Sherway Gardens is currently under construction for a planned opening in the fall of 2017.[44][45] The first Nordstrom Rack in the country is to open in Toronto during 2018.[46]
Puerto Rico[edit]
Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[47]
Sales events[edit]




Map of Nordstrom locations in the United States


Nordstrom holds six designated sale events each year. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales.
Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[48] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at a large discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom rewards members are able to make appointments with sales associates to shop the sale early through the store's Early Access event.[49]
Recognition[edit]
Nordstrom was listed at No. 72 in Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009.[50] Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame member of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list.[51] Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005.[52] For the 20th year in a row, they made the list coming in at No. 94 in 2017.[53][54] In 2010, it ranked number 53, and dropped to 61 in 2012.[55] Nordstrom was ranked No. 286, previously 293, on the Fortune 500 for 2007 and in 2015 ranked 224.[56][57]
in December 2013, Women's Wear Daily (WWD) reported Nordstrom as the top fashion retailer.[58]

Nordstrom's Simple Strategy For Beating Everyone Else In Retail

Nordstrom is one of the
  best investments in retail.
Reuters




  Nordstrom is outperforming every other retail company.  


  The company's shares have gained 110% in five years. The company
  is well-positioned to continue that success in the future,
  according to a 
  recent report by Deutsche Bank. 


  The department store has focused on a few aspects of the business
  to stand out. 


  Here's how Nordstrom is beating retailers from Macy's to T.J.
  Maxx. 


  1. Great customer service. 


  "Throughout their history, they have consistently provided some
  of the best service in the industry," said Robin Lewis, CEO
  of The Robin Report and co-author with
  Michael Dart, of The
  New Rules of Retail – Competing in the World’s Toughest
  Marketplace. 


  Nordstrom is choosy about hiring "nice, capable people,"
  according to 
  Forbes. 


  Customers love the return policy: Nordstrom will take back any
  merchandise people bring back, no questions asked. 


  "The top-notch customer service is a big part of Nordstrom's
  long-term success," Lewis said.

  2. The outlet business. 


  Nordstrom Rack is a huge cash machine for the
  company, Edward Hertzman, founder and Publisher of retail
  publication Sourcing Journal, told Business
  Insider. 


  There is only a 10-20% overlap between Nordstrom Rack customers
  and the high-end department store, meaning that plenty of people
  are still paying full-price too.


  "The outlets have given them exposure to a completely different
  customer who is all about value," Hertzman said. 


  Nordstrom 
  has opened more than 70 Rack locations since 2010, and has
  plans to build dozens more.

  3. Reaching young customers.


  Nordstrom has solved one of the biggest problems facing
  retailers: reaching millennial customers, Lewis said. 


  "The outlet business gives Nordstrom exposure to young customers
  who are seeking a deal and otherwise wouldn't be shopping there,"
  he said. "The company believes that the younger customer will
  migrate into the full-line stores as they grow older."


  While Lewis believes there is a risk of the outlet business
  diluting the brand's image, he says that brands like Nordstrom
  that offer a variety of brands are less at-risk than name brands
  like Michael Kors. 


  "They have a breadth of brands, so having outlets might not
  tarnish the nameplate," he said. 







Nordstrom's omnichannel
  strategy helps it resonate with young
  customers.

  4. Emphasizing omnichannel. 


  Nordstrom is determined to be the world's top omnichannel
  retailer.


  "This company is at the forefront of e-commerce and omnichannel
  retail," Lewis said. 


  Nordstrom recently made it possible to instantly buy the items
  
  featured on Instagram. 


  Workers also merchandise stores 
  using input from its Pinterest page. Items that are popular
  on the social media site are featured more prominently on the
  sales floor. 


  Nordstrom has also aggressively invested in e-commerce, investing
  in men's brands Bonobos and Trunk Club and its own flash-sale
  site, Hautelook.


  "Nordstrom has spent more than a billion dollars investing in
  this aspect of the business, and it's paying off," Hertzman said.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
