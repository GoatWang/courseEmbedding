Convertible note investing explained

How it works:
Investors loan funds to the business which convert to equity at a discount to the price of the next round of equity financing.

Use this calculator to get a better understanding of different potential outcomes when investing through a convertible note.
This is a simplified calculation; exact equity provided through a convertible note will depend on the conversion mechanics used in the note offering as well as the terms provided in the future equity offering.



How much equity will I potentially own when investing through a convertible note?

Convertible Note Basics
A convertible note is an investment structure that allows a company to take on funding in exchange for equity at a later date.  At the time of the investment, the funds are considered debt, but at some date in the future, those funds (+ any accrued interest) convert to equity.  A discount is typically included in a convertible note that provides investors equity at a cheaper price than what equity is being offered at, at the time of conversion. This discount compensates the investors for investing at an earlier date. If the notes have not been converted to equity by the maturity date (often 12 to 24 months), the debt plus interest is due and payable to investors.
A convertible note can be a good tool for a company to raise funds to help bridge to a larger equity offering to occur at a later date.  For companies that are early with respect to customer and revenue traction it can be difficult to set the valuation of the business.  A convertible note does not require a valuation to be set, offering a simpler transaction structure to close a smaller amount of funding. The company should then be able to more quickly close and deploy the capital to make progress with the business.

Business Plan


Sojourner’s Brewing Project will compete in the fast-growing craft beer industry, initially in the greater Denver market. Sojourner’s Brewing Project will open under a beer wholesaler’s license, and, for the first couple years, will focus on building community and recognition around their taproom, with limited self-distribution to area bars in the form of leased kegs and liquor stores in the form of 22oz bombers and 12oz cans. Sojourner’s Brewing Project was inspired by a passion for homebrewing and a love of teaching. The word “Sojourner’s” is meant to invoke images of the intrepid explorer; “Brewing Project” pays homage to some of the small nanobreweries that have been the inspiration behind our high-release brewing model. Sojourner’s Brewing Project is a Limited Liability Company with two Members: Andrew Moore and Ben Gettinger. Andrew is a medal-winning amateur brewer who currently works for 105 Degree West Brewing in Castle Rock as a server and assistant brewer. In the past, he worked in packaging and cellaring for Boulder Beer Company, brewed for Crystal Springs Brewing, taught courses at Castle Rock Homebrew Supply, and assisted in the preliminary development of 105 Degree West Brewing Company. Ben holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Harvard and will finish a JD/MBA at Indiana University in May 2016. He left an options-trading job in Chicago in 2010 and returned to his small hometown in Indiana to take over publishing his family’s newspaper from his ailing mother. Upon matriculating at IU, he assisted in the sale of the business and has interned for three summers at in-house consulting roles for Fortune-200 companies.

About Commitment Amounts


The dollar amounts displayed represent investor interest/commitments only, not actual dollars raised by the business or placed in escrow. There can be no assurances that the business will raise the full commitment amount.  Potential investors that have expressed an interest in the Offering and indicated a commitment amount may subsequently cancel their investment commitment, fail to fund all or a portion of their commitment amount, or the business may reject all or a portion of their commitment amount.  Investors should not place any reliance on the Company’s receipt of commitments in an amount equal to or greater than the targeted minimum amount of commitments set forth on the Localstake Marketplace Platform as an indication that the Company has or will receive such amount.
For this offering, there is no aggregate minimum amount that must be raised in the offering and there is no provision for the escrow of any part of the proceeds of the Offering.  Each individual investment transaction will be closed on an investor-by-investor basis.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
