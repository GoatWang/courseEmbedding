Richard W. Hertzberg

New Jersey Zinc Professor Emeritus
Lehigh University 
Phone: (610) 737-7966
Email: rwh1@lehigh.edu 
Dr. Hertzberg received his B.S. Mech. Eng. (CCNY) Cum Laude, M.S. Metallurgy (MIT), and Ph.D. Metallurgical Eng (Lehigh). During his 48-year career at Lehigh University, he served as Professor and Chair of the Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering where he received major university teaching, research, and service awards. In addition, he is Fellow, ASMI and was the recipient of the 2000 Educator Award from The Metallurgical Society, this nation's professional materials organization. This award cited Dr. Hertzberg as the most outstanding materials science educator in the nation. 
Dr. Hertzberg has published more than 230 research papers, six books, including the fifth edition of his text "Deformation and Fracture Mechanics of Engineering Materials" that he co-authored with Richard Vinci and Jason Hertzberg; earlier editions of this title had been translated into Russian, Chinese, and Korean. He has lectured and consulted extensively throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, and the Middle East on the subject of fracture mechanics. His research interests include the fatigue and fracture response of engineering metals and plastics.
He has participated in and/or directed dozens of short courses in fracture mechanics, failure analysis, product liability, and fatigue of engineering plastics in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. He has also presented numerous lectures in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. More recently, Dr Hertzberg has presented lectures to various community groups, including public libraries, adult education programs, and both elementary and high school students.

The 5th edition includes new end-of-chapter homework problems, examples, illustrations, and a new chapter on products liability and recall addressing the associated social consequences of product failure. The new edition continues to discuss actual failure case histories, and includes new discussion of the fracture behavior and fractography of ceramics, glasses, and composite materials, and a section on natural materials including bone and sea shells.   New co-authors Richard P. Vinci and Jason L. Hertzberg add their talent and expertise to broaden the book's perspective, while maintaining a balance between the continuum mechanics understanding of the failure of solids and the roles of the material's nano- and microstructure as they influence the mechanical properties of materials.      Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewLibraryThing ReviewUser Review  - all4metals - LibraryThingThis is one of the best textbooks on physical metallurgy.
