Overview
Craig is a successful trial attorney who helps clients protect and defend their inventions in complex intellectual property litigation.  Technology companies of all sizes, from Fortune 50 companies to start-ups, have relied on him to take care of their most sensitive intellectual property matters.  He has represented entities such as Foursquare Labs, MIT, Bose and Avid Technology in intellectual property litigation throughout the country and the world.  Craig has handled matters before federal district courts and appellate courts, as well as the International Trade Commission (ITC).  He also handles post-grant review proceedings before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, including inter partes review and reexaminations.
Craig’s litigation strategy and management have resulted in many pre-trial victories, helping to avoid expensive trials and, in one case, averting potential damages in excess of a billion dollars.

Successfully defended a biotechnology device manufacturer in patent litigation, obtaining summary judgment of no infringement, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Successfully defended a global software company in patent litigation, obtaining summary judgment of no infringement.
Successfully defended a humidity measurement manufacturer in trade secret litigation, defeating motion for preliminary injunction.
Successfully defended a mobile application provider in patent litigation, winning motion to dismiss because the patents-in-suit claimed unpatentable subject matter.

When trial is necessary, Craig has achieved impressive results for his clients.

Successfully defended a chemical manufacturer in an ITC litigation investigation, obtaining final decision that the asserted patent was not infringed and invalid.
With only four days’ notice, prepared for and led trial team in patent infringement jury trial, which resulted in a mid-trial settlement.
Successfully defended a global software company in patent litigation, obtaining jury victory of no infringement. The case was selected by The National Law Journal for inclusion in its annual list of “Top Defense Wins.”

Clients have praised the work performed by Craig and his litigation team. Brad Murray, Roscid President notes: “Lando & Anastasi immediately understood our needs and worked closely with us to quickly and aggressively respond to {plaintiff’s} unfounded complaint and motion. We are thrilled with L&A’s litigation team. Their aggressive strategy, thoroughness, due diligence and commitment to quickly and efficiently resolving this case was invaluable to us.”
Dr. Michael Zumbrum, AllPure CEO states: “We are very pleased with the outcome of this litigation and thrilled with the work the attorneys at Lando & Anastasi performed to resolve this case. Throughout this process, L&A’s litigation team worked aggressively and efficiently to win this case.”
Craig has been named a “Super Lawyer” by Thomson Reuters, and a Massachusetts “Super Lawyer – Rising Star” by Law & Politics magazine and the publishers of Boston Magazine.  This year, Craig was included in the IAM Patent 1000: The World’s Leading Patent Practitioners. He was also recognized by Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly as one of 15 “Up & Coming Lawyers.”
Craig’s practice also focuses on advising clients on intellectual property matters, including acquisitions, strategic management of patent, trademark and copyright portfolios, due diligence, licensing, and pre-suit investigations.  He has extensive licensing experience, including initiating programs to monetize patent and copyright portfolios.  His client-focused approach to litigation and licensing puts a premium value on the client’s input and insight and ensures a close and mutually beneficial relationship.

Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Planning Series: Identifying the Risks (Part 1 of 6)
June 29, 2017
By: Thomas M. Sullivan and Craig R. Smith
Lando & Anastasi, LLP was proud to organize, moderate and participate in a recent Association of Corporate Counsel – Northeast (ACC-Northeast) program on “Cybersecurity Strategic Planning.” This program provided practical solutions to threats against your data, privacy, and trade secrets. The panel provided insights and recommendations on how to prepare and implement a cybersecurity and data privacy plan. The panel was moderated by Thomas M. Sullivan, Partner at Lando & Anastasi and included an interactive discussion of cybersecurity and data privacy experts:

Hugo Teufel, III – Senior Counsel for Global Privacy, Raytheon (and former Chief Privacy Officer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security)
David Doggett – Senior Director of Cybersecurity and Network Infrastructure, Schneider Electric
Gareth Tungatt – Chief Underwriting Officer and Co-Founder, Ascent Underwriting, part of the Lloyds Syndicate
Craig R. Smith – Cybersecurity and Litigation Partner, Lando & Anastasi, LLP

Our cybersecurity and data privacy team will feature a series of articles on the key takeaways from the program. Topics include Identifying the Risks; Planning; Jurisdiction; Employee Training; Competitive Differentiation and Third Party Risks.
This first part of our series summarizes why Cybersecurity and Data Privacy should be critical issues for all organizations.
As readily apparent from daily news reports, no organization is immune to the risks of a cyber-attack or data privacy incident. Corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies are all potential targets. Sophisticated hackers are not just targeting large companies, they are also looking for vulnerabilities among smaller to mid-sized companies, especially vendors and suppliers of larger companies. The recent hack of a Netflix vendor is a prime example. In that case, hackers stole unreleased episodes of “Orange is the New Black” by attacking a vendor that performs post-production work for Netflix.
Many businesses understand that cybersecurity is important, but do not view it as a strategic threat to their business. As a result, companies do not dedicate sufficient time and resources to identifying and mitigating the risks. Corporate management must understand the risks and be part of the team assembled to prepare for and address cyber threats. Participation at the highest levels of the organization emphasizes the importance of planning and prevention and enables deployment of the necessary resources.
Companies should not wait until an attack has occurred to evaluate their systems and protect them from being compromised. Creating and implementing a cybersecurity plan is an important first step to assessing a company’s risks and ensuring that security incidents are either thwarted or detected and promptly addressed. Risk mitigation is the goal of a good cybersecurity plan. There is no reasonable way to lock down all your data, but you can put in place the proper protections, monitoring tools, and recovery resources to mitigate the risk.
Every organization should identify its own cybersecurity and data privacy risks and begin planning for an inevitable attack. In the next part of this series, we will discuss the need for a cybersecurity plan and how to prepare it.
Contact us for more information on this panel discussion and any cybersecurity and data privacy issues.

MONEY, MORALITY & THE MACHINE: 
Smith's Law in an Unethical, Over-Governed Age
By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 10/2016, paperback, 250 pages,
moneymoralityandthemachine.com

Discover how to take back your freedom, liberty and money from "The Machine" - a powerful elite who are sucking the lifeblood from our society.

Authors Smith and Ponte explain why a nation's currency has consequences - and how bad money drives good morals out of our society. The result: the buying and selling of political and economic favors has replaced moral fortitude and personal responsibility.

This fascinating book offers a simple plan to restore our nation’s crumbling foundation and preserve your wealth!

WE HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE AND IT LOOKS LIKE BALTIMORE:
American Dream Vs. Progressive Dream
By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 11/2015, paperback, 252 pages, thefuturelookslikebaltimore.com

"We are now suspended between two dreams," write Craig Smith and Lowell Ponte. The American Dream of individual freedom and liberty and the un-American, Progressive Dream of collectivism and bigger government.

Authors Craig R. Smith and Lowell Ponte tell the amazing story of how Baltimore arose, then fell because of its addiction to Progressive corruption and welfare-state dependency. This once great city now risks disintegrating in rioting, drugs and despair.

Will Baltimore’s decline be our future? Read the book to find out!

DON'T BANK ON IT!:
The Unsafe World of 21st Century Banking 
By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 11/2014, paperback, 252 pages, dontbankonitbook.com

The symbol of bank security has been the safe. Today it should be the "unsafe" because, as this book reveals, your bank deposits are now in danger in at least 20 major ways – from cybercriminals, money-hungry politicians, Too-Big-To-Fail bankers, and those now stealing your dollars’ value – including the dollars you thought were secure inside bank vaults.

Your bank account is systematically being robbed, and is at serious risk of being seized and looted. How much interest is your bank paying you for putting your money at such risk? Less Than Zero Percent!

Monetary expert Craig R. Smith and futurist Lowell Ponte show why it has become illogical, and hazardous to your wealth, to trust your money to today's increasingly vulnerable and unsafe banks.

THE GREAT WITHDRAWAL:
How the Progressives' 100-Year Debasement of America and the Dollar Ends
By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 10/2013, paperback, 252 pages 
greatwithdrawal.com

The Great Withdrawal explains why America's future is clearly reflected in Detroit's bankruptcy - unless we are able to stop government spending, taxing and wasting of resources upon our current bankrupt ideology that produces anti-growth economic policies.

As a result, freedom-loving Americans have begun a historic withdrawal march - withdrawing their resources, time and talent in search of the restoration of self, family and local government.

Shrinking today's Progressive federal government will clear the way for Constitutionally-correct government and sound money to again preserve citizen's wealth for future generations.

THE GREAT DEBASEMENT: 
The 100-Year Dying of the Dollar and How to Get America's Money Back
inflation By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 11/2012, paperback, 283 pages
greatdebasement.com

When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.
- Benjamin Franklin

The 2012 election and 2013 "Fiscal Cliff" of massive tax increases are ominous echoes of what happened exactly 100 years ago.

The strange 1912 election turned America's government over to Progressives, who in 1913 imposed the Federal Reserve System and the income tax.

President Barack Obama's reelection could make Progressive rule permanent by turning a majority of voters into government dependents.

THE INFLATION DECEPTION: 
Seven Ways Government Tricks Us...And Seven Ways to Stop It!

By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 07/2011, paperback, 272 pages
inflationdeception.com

History is largely a history of inflation, usually inflations engineered by governments for the gain of governments.
- Friedrich A. Hayek
Nobel Laureate Economist

"High, or even hyper, inflation is rapidly approaching.

After 30 years of helping people hedge against financial risk, I can feel the tremors of this oncoming economic tidal wave rumbling beneath my feet. It is far bigger than I have ever felt.

  The coming devastation will put America's economy underwater and destroy the U.S. Dollar as we have known it, as the world's Reserve Currency."

- Craig R. Smith
from his Introduction to The Inflation Deception

Crashing the Dollar: 
How to Survive a Global Currency Collapse  
By Craig R. Smith with Lowell Ponte
Published 10/2010, Paperback, 208 pages
Crashingthedollar.com

"The United States is digging the biggest economic hole in human history. This hole of debt is now so deep that, if you listen carefully, you can hear the voices of Chinese creditors asking one another if they will ever get back the $900 billion they have lent to us."

America's debt, deficit and unfunded liabilities exceed $120 trillion, writes Smith, and are now impossible to pay off with either tax increases or spending cuts. Politicians of both parties, he writes, will simply print as many dollars as they need to "monetize" this debt, paying off with greatly devalued dollars.

But, much as happened in 1922-23 in Germany's Weimar Republic after World War I, write Smith and former think tank futurist Lowell Ponte, the printing of tens of trillions of dollars to pay America's debts will destroy the value of personal savings,  pensions, fixed mortgages and other fixed-dollar assets.

Black Gold Stranglehold: The Myth of Scarcity and the Politics of Oil 
  By Jerome R. Corsi, Ph.D. and Craig R. Smith
  Published 11/2005, Hardcover, 356 pages
  Experts estimate that Americans consume more than 25 percent of the world's oil
  but have control over less than 3 percent of its proven oil supply. This unbalanced
  pattern of consumption makes it possible for foreign governments, corrupt political
  leaders, terrorist organizations, and oil conglomerates to hold the economy and the
  citizens of the United States in a virtual stranglehold.
  
  In "Black Gold Stranglehold," Jerome Corsi and Craig Smith expose the fraudulent
  science that has made America so vulnerable: the belief that oil is a fossil fuel
  and that it is a finite resource. This book reveals that oil is not a product of
  fossils and prehistoric forests but rather the bio-product of a continuing biochemical
  reaction below the earth's surface that is brought to attainable depths by the
  centrifugal forces of the earth's rotation.

  Rediscovering Gold in the 21st Century: The Complete Guide to the Next Gold Rush
  By Craig R. Smith
  Published 8/2001, Paperback, 172 pages
  The financial climate changed dramatically as the 21st century was born. Gone are the dot-com
  gurus predicting endless growth without earnings or profits. Sadly, individual stockholders
  ignorant of the most basic economic principles - like asset diversification and knowing the
  difference between savings and investment - lost more than $4 trillion in 2000 alone! Ouch!
  
  But it is never too late to change direction. "Rediscovering Gold in the 21st Century" was written to help readers ...
      * Learn how & why to diversify assets based on historical principles.
      * Understand why gold is timeless wealth and the basis for all money.
      * Discover today's most exciting and profitable U.S. rare coin market.

  
  "While most pundits were proclaiming 'gold is dead' as a viable investment, I begged to differ.
  My goal is to give the reader a simple roadmap to get ready for sweeping change in the gold
  and U.S. coin markets that will surprise virtually everyone." -Craig R. Smith, author

About Craig R. Smith



   Contact Craig R. Smith 

Craig R. Smith is Chairman of Swiss America Trading Corporation, a national investment firm specializing in U.S. gold and silver coins. Mr. Smith founded the company in 1982 out of a bedroom in his home with $50.00. It has since grown into one of the largest and most respected firms in the industry known for its dedication to consumer education and safety.

Mr. Smith is an expert in many forms of tangible assets including; oil, precious metals and U.S. numismatic (collectible) coins. He is often sought after by the media for his common sense insights on breaking news, world events, and financial trends. Over the past two decades Mr. Smith has been interviewed on over 1,500 radio and TV programs. He has also been featured in various print publications. These include: FOX News, CNN, CNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, CBN, TBN, Time, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and Newsweek. Craig is a frequent guest on Fox's Your World with Neil Cavuto and Harvest TV's Money Moment. 

Mr. Smith's free market economic worldview offers audiences a breath of fresh air amid today's failed 'big government' approach. He believes we need a revival of self-government and free market principles to help rebuild the American economy; unlike the current administration's belief in multi-trillion dollar 'cradle-to-grave' government dependence. Craig is a student of history and author of nine books; 

Mr. Smith's and co-author Lowell Ponte's newest book, MONEY, MORALITY & THE MACHINE: Smith's Law in an Unethical, Over-Governed Age (Oct. 2016) will empower you to take control of what matters most: your life, liberty and money! Discover how power-hungry politicians are turning the U.S. into a globalist empire and how to insure wealth against phony political promises and fake money.

In WE HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE AND IT LOOKS LIKE BALTIMORE: American Dream Vs. Progressive Dream (Nov. 2015) monetary expert Craig R. Smith and futurist Lowell Ponte explore the sinister origins and roots of Progressivism - an un-American, anti-individualism and pro-collectivism, anti-free market and pro-socialist ideology - that shares common ideological ancestry with both Nazism and Communism.


Mr. Smith's 2014 book, DON'T BANK ON IT! The Unsafe World of 21st Century Banking (Sept. 2014) shows why it has become illogical, and hazardous to your wealth, to trust your money to today's increasingly vulnerable and unsafe banks - which are hackable, trackable and taxable by spendaholic politicians. Smith and co-author Lowell Ponte propose a surprising alternative future you can bank on to save your savings. 

Mr. Smith's 2013 book, THE GREAT WITHDRAWAL: How the Progressives' 100-Year Debasement of America and the Dollar Ends (Nov. 2013) explores why Detroit failed, why other liberal cities may soon follow, and how this could drag America into insolvency and prolonged Depression. As a result, freedom-loving Americans have begun a historic withdrawal march - withdrawing their resources, time and talent in search of a restoration of self, family and local government. 

Mr. Smith's 2012, THE GREAT DEBASEMENT: The 100-Year Dying of the Dollar and How to Get America's Money Back (Nov. 2012) explains how Progressivism become America's ruling political ideology a century ago by ushering in the income tax and Federal Reserve System in 1913 - and gave Progressive politicians nearly-unlimited power to tax, spend and borrow. The resulting monetary debasement has produced the greatest confiscation of wealth in human history.

In his 2011 book THE INFLATION DECEPTION: Seven Ways Government Tricks Us... And Seven Ways to Stop It! (July 2011) Mr. Smith and his co-author former think tank futurist Lowell Ponte expose the long-unseen powerful forces behind the current economic crisis. They offer three political and three financial ways to restore a free and prosperous America, and one personal way you can save your life savings and protect your family. 

"President Barack Obama's economic policies will insure a weaker dollar, rising inflation and crippling debt for generations to come," says Smith in, Crashing the Dollar: How to Survive a Global Currency Collapse, released in October 2010.

"The United States now has combined short-term and long-term obligations of more than $120 trillion. The current economic downturn soon be replaced," this book predicts, "by severe inflation that could destroy the value of the U.S. Dollar." But says Smith, individuals with their own "gold standard" can thrive during a hyper-inflationary crash of the dollar.

Mr. Smith's first book, Rediscovering Gold in the 21st Century: The Complete Guide to the Next Gold Rush (2001), announced a new bull market in precious metals (back when gold sold for $265/oz). This book was written to help its readers learn how and why to diversify assets based on historical principles, understand why gold is timeless wealth and create a solid financial foundation during changing times.

In his second book, Black Gold Stranglehold: The Myth of Scarcity and the Politics of Oil, (2005) Smith and his co-author Dr. Jerome Corsi point out that Americans consume more than 25 percent of the world's oil but have control over less than 3 percent of its proven supply. They assert that this unbalanced pattern of consumption makes it possible for foreign governments, corrupt political leaders, terrorist organizations, and oil conglomerates to place the citizens and the economy of the U.S. in a stranglehold of supply and demand. Smith and Corsi also expose the fraudulent science behind the belief that oil is a fossil fuel and a finite resource.

Throughout the 1990s, Mr. Smith hosted a variety of national radio programs including The Craig Smith Show on Standard Broadcasting Network, America Talks on Christian Broadcasting Network, True Wealth on KKLA as well as World Economic Perspectives and Worldview Perspectives.

In 1993, Smith assisted the FBI with the Waco standoff by allowing David Korresh to deliver a message on his national radio program, America Talks. The bureau honored him with a letter of commendation for his exemplary work in attempting to resolve this tragic situation. During that time, Mr. Smith also hosted Our Times, a syndicated, live television interview program discussing geopolitical issues.

As a dedicated husband and father, Mr. Smith has always had a deep concern for the well being of American families. In the late 1990s he launched two projects to help protect them. In 1997, he inspired the national launch of the Year 2000 National Educational Taskforce (Y2KNET). This taskforce distributed millions of free resources from the American Red Cross.

In 1999, he turned his attention toward protecting families from objectionable, pornographic and violent content on the web with a internet content filtering program called We-Blocker. This program was made available free of charge to families around the country.

Mr. Smith has continued with his community service through the Dream Centers in Los Angeles, Phoenix and New York as well as through his church.

Mr. Smith and his wife Melissa were married in 1977 and reside in Paradise Valley, Arizona. They have two grown daughters.

                              determines his or her position in First Amendment cases. In addition, the profiles drawn in this study can help future Ciceros
                              win their cases before the sitting Court"-

                              An avid high school debater and enthusiastic student body president, Craig Smith seemed destined for a life in public service
                                 from an early age. As a sought-after speechwriter, Smith had a front-row seat at some of the most important events of the
                                 twentieth century, meeting with Robert Kennedy and Richard Nixon, advising Governor Ronald Reagan, writing for President Ford,
                                 serving as a campaign manager for a major U.S. senator's reelection campaign, and writing speeches for a contender for the
                                 Republican nomination for president. Life in the volatile world of politics wasn't always easy, however, and as a closeted
                                 gay man, Smith struggled to reconcile his private and professional lives. In this revealing memoir, Smith sheds light on what
                                 it takes to make it as a speechwriter in a field where the only constant is change. While bouncing in and out of the academic
                                 world, Smith transitions from consultantships with George H. W. Bush and the Republican caucus of the U.S. Senate to a position

I have now been with him for several years, and many court hearings, regarding post-divorce issues. Michael is the first attorney who didn't waste my time—every minute counts when being billed by the hour! As soon as we'd sit down, we got right to business. I liked that! He's the only attorney who's ever taken consistent notes, and actually reviewed them. Even better, ALL communication was directly with Michael. All my previous attorneys would have me communicate with their paralegals. Very little got relayed to my attorney, of whom it mattered, and what did was choppy and inaccurate. What's the point?! That was never the case with Michael. My nickname for Michael is Rainman. (Although he doesn't know it.) During my intake meeting, he asked how old my kids were. I told him. He clarified by asking, "Do you mean X?" He was right! I was so embarrassed! One child had had a birthday and I was wrong! Michael caught that from actually reading my form! What a breath of fresh air!  His attention to detail has continued to be impressive over the years. I have come to realize all attorneys will want to help you settle, in your best interest.  Prepare for the worst (court), hope for the best (settle).  The Boise Judges always seem annoyed. You have a 50/50 chance of winning/loosing.  Not good odds. They blame you both for being there, regardless of what you have on the other party.  However, you will want a good attorney to guide you through the process, protect your interests, and write up your legal documents in detail and without ambiguity.  If you do go to court, you want someone who is well prepared.  Either way, Michael is that guy! Atkinson Law Office, PLLCjordaneric ratedGetting arrested for a DUI is a scary, embarrassing and confusing process. I will be the first person to admit, I made a bad decision. I was fortunate, no one was hurt, there was no accident. The process is not easy to understand and certainly not one I wanted to go in alone. There is a great deal of misinformation associated with a charge like this. I called Craig and he set up an appointment immediately. He was very personable and not accusatory. Since my arrest, meeting Craig was the first thing that felt right and I felt that maybe I would get out of this with minimal damage.Craig explained each step he was going to take. Since this was my first offence, he explained what the best and worst case scenarios would be. There was a minimal disruption of my work and personal life. Craig took care of everything. When the time came for my trial, it was reassuring having an experienced attorney who understood the system to represent my interests. Craig did the best job anyone could have done. He explained what was expected of me moving forward and when the time came, would follow up.The cost was very reasonable. When you research online and you read the stories of cost, you get nervous about the total financial impact. Now I can’t speak for everyone, but Craig was very reasonable and the service was terrific.My first advice, is never drink and drive. However, if you do make a mistake, I would highly recommend Craig Atkinson. He did a great job for me and it will be best decision you can make in a confusing and difficult process. Morton Law Offices, Charteredwendy ratedI retained Morton Law Offices, Chartered to represent me in connection with a personal injury claim. From the very start, I was impressed with Alan Morton’s thoroughness in getting the job done for me.  He has a keen eye and attention to detail.  He certainly dots the “I”s and crosses the “T”s in everything he did for me.  I felt that he had my best interests at heart all the while he represented me.  He was accessible to me all throughout my claim to answer my questions and concerns.  He even provided me with his cell phone number so that I could reach with him after hours or on the weekend.  If necessary.  If I am ever in need of an attorney in the future, Mr. Morton is my first and only choice.Because of the rigors of my job, that made it difficult for me to take time off of work to travel to an attorney’s office.  Mr. Morton on more than one occasion was willing to meet with me at my work when we needed to get together to go over material on my case and/or for me to sign important documents.  I enthusiastically endorse and recommend Alan Morton to anyone who may need an attorney to help them.   Chiropractic ArtsBetsy W. ratedWell this my 4 review about Dr.Pewe let's me tell u about him and he has my family's Chiropractor for almost 24 years now and he is kind,sweet,loving with his patient's and knows what best for them and if i don't have Chiopactic care in my life it would make Dr.Pewe very sad and i am thankful for Dr.Pewe has done for my family,friends that go see him and he has been there for me every step of the way and i can't live without him in my life and he gotten rid of my headaches ,muscle spam,and sometimes i had to go back in to see him with my bad headaches and thank-You Dr.Pewe i can't tell you how i am thankful for u in my life and for your brother Dr.Daniel Pewe as well and if it wasn't for you i would be 10 times worse and you are the best chiropractor for my family and friends who needs help and thanks for all u do for me to help me and i am glad to be your paitent in your life and Daine knows what she does and your staff has been good to me as well and i don't want to lose you from Betsy Wilcox      Atkinson Law Office, PLLCDonna P. ratedI had never been in trouble with the law before so when I needed legal representation, I didn't know where to turn.  I googled defense attorneys and out of the long list of choices, I picked Craig.  It was one of the luckiest choices I ever made.  I was able to make a personal appointment with him immediately and he thoroughly explained my options and what to expect as my case proceeded.  The outcome of my case was beyond fair and reasonable thanks to Craig’s excellent representation.In addition to the time I spent with him about my case, I have learned a lot about Idaho law and criminal proceedings by reading his excellent blog posts.  He thoroughly explains aspects of the law and the legal process in plain English.  I would recommend Craig to anyone in need of a hardworking, smart defense attorney.Atkinson Law Office, PLLCyewenw ratedThanks for the site. i was an immigrant in a strange new country when i was charged. I really needed to speak with a lawyer. i have never talked to a lawyer in my life. I was so nervous. Then i met Craig,he is a lawyer who is personable as an individual and highly professional and intelligent. He make our communication very smooth.He was very patient and helped me feel at ease.Although I was still scared he helped remove the stress and the hopeless felling. i felt genuine optimism,His advice and opinion became a weapon on my side to win my case. The case was dismissed.He helped me get my life back.Moriarty, Michaeljenandden ratedI have been going to Dr. Moria...I have been going to Dr. Moriarty at Energetic Chiropractic for the past 8 years. He is extremely professional and very good at what he does. He practices applied kinesiology which uses muscle testing to determine what areas of the body need to be worked on as well as to determine allergies, food sensitivities, glandular and organ needs, etc. I recommend him to everyone I talk to who is looking for a good chiropractor or a doctor who can help them feel better. Also, is staff is wonderful and caring. Atkinson Law Office, PLLCDaryl R. ratedI contacted Atkinson Law on a whim, I was not intending to use a lawyer.  But after a brief phone call (That Craig himself answered) I was sold.  I was totally blown away at the availability of Craig and his staff.  They are very patient and willing to explain everything going on with your case.  I even asked him about a family legal issue that he was able to provide some insight on.  Thank you Craig and Dinko!  I appreciate your hard work and awesome business practices.Atkinson Law Office, PLLCMike K. ratedCraig took on my DUI case.  Met with me right away explained all of my options and formulated a game plan on how to win. My case was complicated and Craig took the time to do more case study research to help win my case then I could have ever imagined from a fixed rate attorney.  Outstanding commitment!!  Really helped me feel comfortable and got me and my family through this bad situation with class, professionalism, and compassion. Highly recommend  Advantage Walk-In ChiropracticJesse N. ratedThe service is outstanding! From the very first visit they informed us how much insurance would cover, expected costs, etc. They are always friendly, give suckered to the kids, have a good play area, and most importantly they are skilled helping adjust you back to normal. If you are looking for a chiropractor office that is good, friendly, straight forward with costs, and almost no waiting times then you should give them a try.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Description


Additional Information




Product Description
DID YOU KNOW?

We are not running out of oil now, and we may never run out of it.
Today we have more proven oil reserves than ever before in human history, despite decades of increased consumption.
The United States has enough oil offshore and in Alaska to be oil independent for the decade to come.
The money Americans spend on gas ultimately funds radical terrorist regimes and their supporters in the war against America.
Illegal immigrants are allowed to flood our southern border in order to keep the oil flowing from Mexico.
Carbon dioxide, the bogeyman of the radical environmental movement, is the “food” of plants and trees.
If we grow more trees, they will “consume” the carbon dioxide released by automobiles.
Scientific evidence suggests that in the coming decades the earth is as likely to cool as it is too warm.
“Global warming” is a scientific hoax at the center of the radical political agenda of environmental extremists.

Experts estimate that Americans consume more than 25 percent of the world’s oil but have control over less than 3 percent of its proven oil supply. This unbalanced pattern of consumption makes it possible for foreign governments, corrupt political leaders, terrorist organizations and oil conglomerates to hold the economy and the citizens of the United States in a virtual stranglehold. There is no greater proof of this than the direct relationship between skyrocketing gas prices and the explosion of wealth among those who control the world’s supply of oil.
In Black Gold Stranglehold, Jerome R. Corsi and Craig Smith expose the fraudulent science that has made America so vulnerable: the belief that oil is a fossil fuel and that it is a finite resource.
