History[edit]
In 2000, Steve Wynn agreed to sell Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand in a hostile takeover, after having led Mirage and its predecessors since 1973. Wynn laid the foundation for his next venture that same year, buying the Desert Inn for $270 million.[4]
Wynn found an early partner in Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada of Universal Entertainment Corporation.[5] Wynn, together with Universal subsidiary Aruze USA, controlled almost half the stock, making it harder for outside investors to exert control, as they had done at Mirage in response to Wynn's prolific spending.[4][6]
Wynn hired investment banker Ronald Kramer as president and director in 2002 in order to help take the company public and oversee its expansion.[2]
Wynn Resorts made its initial public offering on NASDAQ on October 25, 2002.
The company's first project, Wynn Las Vegas, opened on April 28, 2005.
Wynn Macau, the company's second project started construction on June 28, 2004. It opened September 5, 2006.
Encore, an extension to Wynn Las Vegas, broke ground on April 28, 2006, the first anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn announced a planned redevelopment of the golf course at Wynn Las Vegas, called Wynn Golf and Country Club, into two separate resorts, and a large lake, connected by the "Wynn Parkway". Redevelopment will not take place before 2009.
Encore at Wynn Macau, the company's second project in Macau Peninsula, Macau, People's Republic of China, opened on April 21, 2010.
Wynn bought 52 acres (21 ha) of the Cotai Strip in Macau where he hopes to break ground in 2012 for Wynn Cotai for a 2013 or early 2014 opening.
The company considered opening a casino as part of the Entertainment City development in the Philippines, but decided against it because of corruption in the country's gaming industry.[6] Okada decided to proceed with the project alone, leading to the rupture of his partnership with Wynn.
The dispute went public with reciprocal accusations of corrupt practices. Wynn and his allies accused Okada of bribing Philippines gaming regulators with over $110,000 in benefits, including free nights in a luxury suite at Wynn Las Vegas, while Okada questioned the propriety of Wynn Resorts' record $135 million donation to the University of Macau.[5] Okada resigned as vice chairman in October 2011, and the following February, after a company investigation by the Freeh Group confirmed the charges against him, the board of directors forced Aruze USA to sell back its shares at a nearly 30% discount.[5] Aruze had been the company's largest shareholder, with a 19.7% stake.
On September 17, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted to approve Wynn Resorts’ proposed $1.6 billion casino to be located in Everett, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. [7]
Effect of the recession on Las Vegas and Macau operations[edit]
In Las Vegas, the 1st quarter of 2009 was the first where the Encore was fully operational after its opening on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas. Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets.
Despite the additional casino at the Encore (which added 97 tables and 857 slot machines to the original 190 tables and 2000 slots) net casino revenues for the combined resort were lower than the first quarter of 2008 when only The Wynn was operating. Net casino revenues for the combined resort dropped from $125.1 million to $117.5 million.
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Although the added 2,034 suites at Encore nearly doubled the suites in the property hotel revenues were up only 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to declining room rates and lower occupancy rate. Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.[8]
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues of the Macau operations declined to $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Gaming on the VIP tables declined drastically.

History[edit]
In 2000, Steve Wynn agreed to sell Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand in a hostile takeover, after having led Mirage and its predecessors since 1973. Wynn laid the foundation for his next venture that same year, buying the Desert Inn for $270 million.[4]
Wynn found an early partner in Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada of Universal Entertainment Corporation.[5] Wynn, together with Universal subsidiary Aruze USA, controlled almost half the stock, making it harder for outside investors to exert control, as they had done at Mirage in response to Wynn's prolific spending.[4][6]
Wynn hired investment banker Ronald Kramer as president and director in 2002 in order to help take the company public and oversee its expansion.[2]
Wynn Resorts made its initial public offering on NASDAQ on October 25, 2002.
The company's first project, Wynn Las Vegas, opened on April 28, 2005.
Wynn Macau, the company's second project started construction on June 28, 2004. It opened September 5, 2006.
Encore, an extension to Wynn Las Vegas, broke ground on April 28, 2006, the first anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn announced a planned redevelopment of the golf course at Wynn Las Vegas, called Wynn Golf and Country Club, into two separate resorts, and a large lake, connected by the "Wynn Parkway". Redevelopment will not take place before 2009.
Encore at Wynn Macau, the company's second project in Macau Peninsula, Macau, People's Republic of China, opened on April 21, 2010.
Wynn bought 52 acres (21 ha) of the Cotai Strip in Macau where he hopes to break ground in 2012 for Wynn Cotai for a 2013 or early 2014 opening.
The company considered opening a casino as part of the Entertainment City development in the Philippines, but decided against it because of corruption in the country's gaming industry.[6] Okada decided to proceed with the project alone, leading to the rupture of his partnership with Wynn.
The dispute went public with reciprocal accusations of corrupt practices. Wynn and his allies accused Okada of bribing Philippines gaming regulators with over $110,000 in benefits, including free nights in a luxury suite at Wynn Las Vegas, while Okada questioned the propriety of Wynn Resorts' record $135 million donation to the University of Macau.[5] Okada resigned as vice chairman in October 2011, and the following February, after a company investigation by the Freeh Group confirmed the charges against him, the board of directors forced Aruze USA to sell back its shares at a nearly 30% discount.[5] Aruze had been the company's largest shareholder, with a 19.7% stake.
On September 17, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted to approve Wynn Resorts’ proposed $1.6 billion casino to be located in Everett, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. [7]
Effect of the recession on Las Vegas and Macau operations[edit]
In Las Vegas, the 1st quarter of 2009 was the first where the Encore was fully operational after its opening on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas. Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets.
Despite the additional casino at the Encore (which added 97 tables and 857 slot machines to the original 190 tables and 2000 slots) net casino revenues for the combined resort were lower than the first quarter of 2008 when only The Wynn was operating. Net casino revenues for the combined resort dropped from $125.1 million to $117.5 million.
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Although the added 2,034 suites at Encore nearly doubled the suites in the property hotel revenues were up only 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to declining room rates and lower occupancy rate. Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.[8]
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues of the Macau operations declined to $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Gaming on the VIP tables declined drastically.

Wynn Resorts shares fall 2% after weak June gambling revenues for Macau
Shares of high-end hotel and casino operator Wynn Resorts Ltd.  slumped 2% Monday, after the latest gaming revenue numbers from Macau fell short of expectations. The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau of Macao said June revenue rose 26% at the Chinese enclave, home of Wynn's most expensive property, the Wynn Palace, opened in 2016 to much fanfare. Instinet analyst Harry Curtis said that was well below the low end of his 30% to 35% estimate. The 22% gain for the second quarter was also below his 24% estimate, as gross gaming revenue fell sharply at the end of June, which the analyst attributed to tensions surrounding China's President Xi Jinping's visit to Macau's neighbor Hong Kong. "While it's too early to determine what, if any, impact the KYC and AML regulations are having on mass and VIP GGR, respectively, this issue will gain increased focus by investors given the June GGR shortfall," he wrote in a note, referring to Know Your Customer anti-money laundering rules. "That said, our view is that Xi's visit (and not KYC/AML regulations) explains most of the end-of-month deceleration." Macau had struggled through several years of declining revenue, after a Chinese government crackdown on corruption that spooked some of the high-rollers that had flocked to its casinos from the mainland. Gaming revenue has Wynn shares have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.9%.

Wynn Resorts stock jumps 3.3% to lead S&P 500 gainers after Barclays upgrade
Wynn Resorts Ltd. shares  climbed 3.3% Friday to lead S&P 500 gainers, after Barclays upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy, citing positive news coming from Macau and Las Vegas. Barclays upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight and raised its price to $144, equal to 13% upside from current levels. Wynn Resorts beat profit estimates by about 30% in its latest quarter, and beat sales estimates by 5.5%, according to FactSet. Revenue from its Las Vegas operations rose 6% from the year-earlier period, while casino revenues were up 3.3%. In Macau, net revenues fell 3.5%, while casino revenues were down 3%. But Macau is expected to continue a recovery that began last August with the opening of Wynn's new Palace casino, which is credited with bringing VIP high-rollers back. Macau has posted nine straight months of higher gambling revenues, according to the Macau Gaming Inspection & Coordination Bureau. Wynn shares have gained 46% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Wynn Resorts Ltd.: The Bear Case From a Bull
The casino operator's stock may be worth the gamble, but it's still a gamble. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Jul 20, 2017 at 9:35PM
            
            





I've been a big fan of Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) for a long time, mainly because Steve Wynn always manages to build resorts that outperform their neighbors. And in recent years, the stock fell to a level where I thought it was a great value. 
But my bullishness doesn't mean I don't see risks ahead for Wynn Resorts. Here's the best case against owning the stock. 

Front view rendering of Wynn Palace in Macau. Image source: Wynn Resorts.

Macau's growth is just a mirage
The biggest driver of Wynn's recovery is that Macau's gaming market began returning to growth just as Wynn Palace opened. So far in 2017, gaming revenue is up 17.2% in the Chinese territory, and there's hope that revenue from its key industry will continue to grow as more resorts are completed and infrastructure improves. 
So far in 2017, the bull theory has held up. But conditions can change on a dime. China has been cracking down on corruption over the last few years, and it's worried about money being laundered through Macau. In the worst case, it could put restrictions on the junket operators that provide loans to Chinese high rollers in patacas in Macau, and then collect on the debts in renminbi after the gamblers return to the Chinese mainland. Squeezing those middlemen could quickly disrupt the VIP market, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Macau's gaming revenue. 
There's also the risk that a recession could strike the U.S. or Chinese economy (or both), which would be a broad negative for the gaming industry overall. The economy is a macro risk for Wynn Resorts, but it's one investors need to be aware of given the leverage Wynn has on its balance sheet. 
Debt is adding more risk than Wynn would like
To build Wynn Palace in Macau and fund the current construction of Wynn Boston Harbor, the company has taken on billions of dollars in new debt. And its leverage, as measured by its debt-to-EBITDA ratio (a proxy for cash flow) is increasing as well. With Wynn Palace in operation, this measure of leverage will fall, but its current level is high nonetheless. 

WYNN Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts
The sheer leverage of debt is what's most worrying about Wynn Resorts today. When gaming companies went into financial turmoil and bankruptcy during the financial crisis, it was primarily because they had more debt than they could handle. Wynn is walking a tightrope right now with its rising debt load. 





Wynn's risk is very real
Bullish investors in Wynn Resorts know these risks exist -- they just think the upside is greater than the downside, and that the Macau market, in particular, will keep growing. But there's a case to be made that Macau could go through another downturn like it did from 2014 to 2016. If that happens, Wynn Resorts' growing debt load could become a very real problem for the company.

Wynn Resorts Limited is a publicly traded corporation based in Paradise, Nevada that is a developer and operator of high end hotels and casinos. It was formed on October 25, 2002, by former Mirage Resorts Chairman and CEO Stephen A. Wynn. As of 2016[update], the Company has developed five properties.[1]

History[edit]
In 2000, Steve Wynn agreed to sell Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand in a hostile takeover, after having led Mirage and its predecessors since 1973. Wynn laid the foundation for his next venture that same year, buying the Desert Inn for $270 million.[4]
Wynn found an early partner in Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada of Universal Entertainment Corporation.[5] Wynn, together with Universal subsidiary Aruze USA, controlled almost half the stock, making it harder for outside investors to exert control, as they had done at Mirage in response to Wynn's prolific spending.[4][6]
Wynn hired investment banker Ronald Kramer as president and director in 2002 in order to help take the company public and oversee its expansion.[2]
Wynn Resorts made its initial public offering on NASDAQ on October 25, 2002.
The company's first project, Wynn Las Vegas, opened on April 28, 2005.
Wynn Macau, the company's second project started construction on June 28, 2004. It opened September 5, 2006.
Encore, an extension to Wynn Las Vegas, broke ground on April 28, 2006, the first anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn announced a planned redevelopment of the golf course at Wynn Las Vegas, called Wynn Golf and Country Club, into two separate resorts, and a large lake, connected by the "Wynn Parkway". Redevelopment will not take place before 2009.
Encore at Wynn Macau, the company's second project in Macau Peninsula, Macau, People's Republic of China, opened on April 21, 2010.
Wynn bought 52 acres (21 ha) of the Cotai Strip in Macau where he hopes to break ground in 2012 for Wynn Cotai for a 2013 or early 2014 opening.
The company considered opening a casino as part of the Entertainment City development in the Philippines, but decided against it because of corruption in the country's gaming industry.[6] Okada decided to proceed with the project alone, leading to the rupture of his partnership with Wynn.
The dispute went public with reciprocal accusations of corrupt practices. Wynn and his allies accused Okada of bribing Philippines gaming regulators with over $110,000 in benefits, including free nights in a luxury suite at Wynn Las Vegas, while Okada questioned the propriety of Wynn Resorts' record $135 million donation to the University of Macau.[5] Okada resigned as vice chairman in October 2011, and the following February, after a company investigation by the Freeh Group confirmed the charges against him, the board of directors forced Aruze USA to sell back its shares at a nearly 30% discount.[5] Aruze had been the company's largest shareholder, with a 19.7% stake.
On September 17, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted to approve Wynn Resorts’ proposed $1.6 billion casino to be located in Everett, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. [7]
Effect of the recession on Las Vegas and Macau operations[edit]
In Las Vegas, the 1st quarter of 2009 was the first where the Encore was fully operational after its opening on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas. Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets.
Despite the additional casino at the Encore (which added 97 tables and 857 slot machines to the original 190 tables and 2000 slots) net casino revenues for the combined resort were lower than the first quarter of 2008 when only The Wynn was operating. Net casino revenues for the combined resort dropped from $125.1 million to $117.5 million.
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Although the added 2,034 suites at Encore nearly doubled the suites in the property hotel revenues were up only 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to declining room rates and lower occupancy rate. Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.[8]
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues of the Macau operations declined to $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Gaming on the VIP tables declined drastically.

History[edit]
In 2000, Steve Wynn agreed to sell Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand in a hostile takeover, after having led Mirage and its predecessors since 1973. Wynn laid the foundation for his next venture that same year, buying the Desert Inn for $270 million.[4]
Wynn found an early partner in Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada of Universal Entertainment Corporation.[5] Wynn, together with Universal subsidiary Aruze USA, controlled almost half the stock, making it harder for outside investors to exert control, as they had done at Mirage in response to Wynn's prolific spending.[4][6]
Wynn hired investment banker Ronald Kramer as president and director in 2002 in order to help take the company public and oversee its expansion.[2]
Wynn Resorts made its initial public offering on NASDAQ on October 25, 2002.
The company's first project, Wynn Las Vegas, opened on April 28, 2005.
Wynn Macau, the company's second project started construction on June 28, 2004. It opened September 5, 2006.
Encore, an extension to Wynn Las Vegas, broke ground on April 28, 2006, the first anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn announced a planned redevelopment of the golf course at Wynn Las Vegas, called Wynn Golf and Country Club, into two separate resorts, and a large lake, connected by the "Wynn Parkway". Redevelopment will not take place before 2009.
Encore at Wynn Macau, the company's second project in Macau Peninsula, Macau, People's Republic of China, opened on April 21, 2010.
Wynn bought 52 acres (21 ha) of the Cotai Strip in Macau where he hopes to break ground in 2012 for Wynn Cotai for a 2013 or early 2014 opening.
The company considered opening a casino as part of the Entertainment City development in the Philippines, but decided against it because of corruption in the country's gaming industry.[6] Okada decided to proceed with the project alone, leading to the rupture of his partnership with Wynn.
The dispute went public with reciprocal accusations of corrupt practices. Wynn and his allies accused Okada of bribing Philippines gaming regulators with over $110,000 in benefits, including free nights in a luxury suite at Wynn Las Vegas, while Okada questioned the propriety of Wynn Resorts' record $135 million donation to the University of Macau.[5] Okada resigned as vice chairman in October 2011, and the following February, after a company investigation by the Freeh Group confirmed the charges against him, the board of directors forced Aruze USA to sell back its shares at a nearly 30% discount.[5] Aruze had been the company's largest shareholder, with a 19.7% stake.
On September 17, 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted to approve Wynn Resorts’ proposed $1.6 billion casino to be located in Everett, Massachusetts, just north of Boston. [7]
Effect of the recession on Las Vegas and Macau operations[edit]
In Las Vegas, the 1st quarter of 2009 was the first where the Encore was fully operational after its opening on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas. Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets.
Despite the additional casino at the Encore (which added 97 tables and 857 slot machines to the original 190 tables and 2000 slots) net casino revenues for the combined resort were lower than the first quarter of 2008 when only The Wynn was operating. Net casino revenues for the combined resort dropped from $125.1 million to $117.5 million.
Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Although the added 2,034 suites at Encore nearly doubled the suites in the property hotel revenues were up only 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to declining room rates and lower occupancy rate. Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.[8]
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues of the Macau operations declined to $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Gaming on the VIP tables declined drastically.

Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets.

Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008.[8]
In the first quarter of 2009, net revenues of the Macau operations declined to $448.7 million compared $491.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Gaming on the VIP tables declined drastically.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
