I treat individuals 18 years and older who live in the lower keys.  I do this by providing a range of services from physicals, diabetes, high blood pressure, colds, etc up to the treatment of life threatening complex hospital based diseases.  Taking care of my patients is what I enjoy.  At this practice we listen to the needs of our patients.  My cell phone number is available to any accepted patient who requests it.  We started the Skin of Key West LLC at the request of many of our patients.  They wanted to beat back some of the wrinkles, dark spots and aging that our beautiful island climate can inflict.

Born in Manhattan, New York and raised in northern New Jersey, I am a graduate of the Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, New Jersey and the New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey. My training includes an Internship, Residency and Chief Residency in Internal Medicine at the University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey. I am honored to hold the American Medical Association's Physician Recognition Award with Commendation for my continuing education. The Florida Keys are my home now. My grandfather was a resident of Islamorada and taught me to sail. I returned to the Keys in order to practice medicine and be a part of the community I have so long enjoyed.  The practice is a mixture of old world and new world. It utilizes tools such as a computerized medical record in order to augment the one-on-one relationship between the doctor and patient. I taught for more than 10 years at that hospital, holding the positions of Medical Director of Primary Care Group, Associate Medical Director for Ambulatory Services and Physician Advisor to Case Management. Now I teach medical students who come from the University of Miami on 6 week rotations. You will sometimes meet them in my practice. I am a fellow of the American College of Physicians. Currently residing in Key Haven, FL with my wife and 2 daughters.ADVERTISEMENT

From time to time, he may run behind, but I can assure you he will spend time with you when it's your turn, he doesn't appear to play "catch-up". I like the fact that our records are digital and can sometimes be accessed by other facilities depending on whether or not the other facility has set up. Similar system. He is very approachable, I feel like I can tell him a55-Karen in Key West, FL | Jul 12, 2016Having several medical issues, I am very thankful to have Dr Norris as my doctor.  He is kind, attentive,and thorough with exams and explanations.  The office is professional and knowledgable. 55-AJ in Key West, FL | Jun 07, 2016I moved to Key West a year ago this month.I searched high and low for a doctor that accepted my insurance and that provided the level of care I have come to expect. I visited 2 other doctors offices prior to this one and his office by far exceeds my other experiences. Zuki at the front desk is amazing and Tonya is always pleasant -  I joke with Dr. Norris that I would take his team as I know how hard it is to find help on this island! Bottom line - combo of staff and Dr. interactions are awesome35-TRACEY sEXTON in Key West, FL | May 24, 2016I am a long time patient and am always pleased with the level of care and concern shown by Dr. Norris. He is genuine, respectful, listens and takes time to develop a relationship with me as a patient. I am however considering looking for a new physician because of his staff. The nurse Tanya is extremely unprofessional and blatantly rude and the office manager clearly does not seem to care. It is clear that neither has, manners, customer service training or showed any signs of care or concern. 15Key West, Fl | Feb 12, 2016The physician was caring and thorough. The staff was uncaring, unfriendly, uninformed and unprofessional. The strange behaviors include failure to return calls or give test results. When you do finally get to speak with staff they seem quite bothered and annoyed. It's embarrassing for the patient. They need customer service training.Have you seen Dr. John Norris III, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Norris III?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim.

Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.
