Wefunder supports three different federal laws that allow startups to raise money legally.  To comply with the law, Wefunder Advisors LLC and Wefunder Portal LLC (both owned by Wefunder Inc) also list startups depending on the regulation used.

Some fine print:  1) These numbers include startups currently live on Wefunder if they pass their minimum target.  2) Some startups use two different laws at the same time (i.e., Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding).

Inc. Uncensored: Religious Businesses, Sidewalk Drones, and a Harrowing 'Shark Tank' Tale


This week, Inc. writers discuss the Supreme Court's recent decision to hear a case involving religious freedom, and the implications it carries for small businesses.

Welcome to the 123rd episode of the Inc. Uncensored podcast, hosted by Inc. editor James Ledbetter.

This week, staff writer Zoë Henry discusses how the Trump administration appears to be warming to religious businesses. The Supreme Court, on Monday, agreed to hear a case on objection to same-sex marriage; a Colorado baker, Masterpiece Cakeshop, had refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple back in 2012. The entrepreneur, Jack Phillips, claimed that participating in such a union would violate his religious views, though a local Colorado court ruled against him 2015. The news comes just weeks after federal officials drafted an interim final rule to roll back an Obamacare mandate that religious employers cover birth control as part of health insurance plans. While some businesses find the news troubling, others welcome what they call an expansion of their rights.
Then, staff writer Will Yakowicz explores how four states in the U.S.--Florida, Wisconsin, Idaho and Virginia--have all passed laws to allow autonomous robots to use sidewalks and crosswalks to deliver packages. Starship Technologies, which makes small ground-based delivery drones, helped create the laws. The group talks about how companies can influence laws to favor the technologies they create.
Finally, reporter Emily Canal tells the compelling story of Windcatcher, a small business that appeared on Shark Tank last year--and subsequently discovered that a rival company was selling a similar product. Founder Ryan Frayne wasn't prepared for what came next, and how it would affect the future of his life and company.
As always, you can listen to individual episodes of the Inc. Uncensored podcast on the Panoply network or on Apple Podcasts, where you can also subscribe.
