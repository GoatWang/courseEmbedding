Leadership















Lloyd Howell Jr. 
Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer







Meet Lloyd
Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer





I started at Booz Allen right out of college, as an engineer. My career path hasn’t been linear. I left to pursue an MBA. I tried Wall Street on for size. I returned to the firm, seeking balance.
But my inquisitive nature, plus my drive, has proven a through line. What excites me about my current position is the opportunity to learn something new.
I see myself as a manager of surprise. Good or bad, I count and report the financial ripples, giving decision makers the information they need to chart their courses accordingly.
When I have free time, I can be found golfing, attending sporting events with my family, or gathering with friends and family.

COLLAPSE






Executive Vice President Lloyd Howell Jr. is the firm's chief financial officer and treasurer. He is responsible for the firm’s financial statements, capital structure, and related financial operations. He previously led the firm's Civil and Commercial business. 
 
Lloyd joined Booz Allen in 1988 as a consultant and provided systems engineering support to multiple Department of Defense satellite programs. In 1991, he took a leave of absence from the firm to get an M.B.A. from Harvard University and worked at Goldman Sachs as an associate in their investment banking division from 1993 to 1995.
 
In 1995, Lloyd returned to Booz Allen where he became a member of the strategy and organization team focused on clients with the Navy/Marine Corps, Army, and Office of the Secretary of Defense. In 2000, he was elected vice president. 
 
From 2009 to 2013, he served as the client service officer of the financial services account. Lloyd has served on the firm’s leadership team since 2007. From 2013 to 2016, Lloyd led our Civil and Commercial business, working on strategic, technology, and analytics projects.
 
Lloyd’s federal clients included the U.S. Department of Treasury and its bureaus, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Commodity Futures Trade Commission, and commercial clients that included the top 50 global financial institutions and significant stock exchanges.

EXPAND



COLLAPSE






Why is Booz Allen an ideal firm for someone with your expertise and skills? There’s an opportunity to learn a lot of different things. Certainly over the course of my career, starting out in more of a technical capacity, then morphing into a combination of technical-managerial-financial, to now one that’s primarily financial. All that opportunity would be available to a prospective candidate.
 
What are the greatest challenges you face in this role? Addressing and managing surprises. Usually not-so-pleasant surprises: a canceled contract, a government shutdown, a loss, things of that sort. What are the financial impacts and ripples? That’s one category of surprise. On the other side of the coin is a positive one. There’s a plus up in the budget and how to account for and accommodate that financial good news. It’s a good surprise, but it’s still something that needs to be accounted for.
 
Where do you see Booz Allen in the next 100 years? What I would hope is that Booz Allen is still working on or engaged with exciting, important areas and topics. I would hope that the workforce of Booz Allen is creative, diverse, and excited about the work they perform.  Financially, I would hope that the company is growing profitably and on a very solid financial foundation. From a capabilities standpoint, I would hope that the firm is seen as a resource of great intellectual capital and work that improves the world.
 
What excites you when you wake up in the morning? That I woke up. It’s going to sound cliché, but coming to work and addressing the opportunities and challenges that face our team day in, day out.
 
What are your three tips for managing and motivating people? Mastery of the content. Do they know their stuff? Their functional expertise? Their ability to communicate effectively—whether that’s to get information or to be persuasive. And that they have something to say, that they’re an active contributor to the discussion, the dialogue, the debate.
 
What mentorship advice would you give to someone who just took on a new leadership role? Exceed expectations.
 
What is the best business advice you’ve gotten in your career? Work hard, play hard.
 
What would you say is your strongest character trait? My instinct.

 
What advice, if you could travel back in time, would you give yourself as a young professional? Trust your instincts.
 
What is an idea or invention you wish you’d thought of first? Post-It notes.
 
What is your favorite book? The Shack.
 
What is something not many people know about you or might surprise the people you work with? I think I’m an open book. I’m a huge Prince fan; I think that was revealed at our last senior leadership off-site. I don’t think I have many more surprises.
 
Who fascinates you? I am fascinated by pretty much anyone who is considered a pioneer. I mean, why? How did they get going? Why? It’s not any one individual. I’m just fascinated by people who are considered to be “the first.”
 
What has been your life’s biggest challenge so far? I guess the most impactful challenge was my mother passed due to cancer weeks before I went to college. That was personally a big challenge. I had to grow up pretty quick. Since then, everything’s been gravy.
 
What do you feel has been your biggest accomplishment so far? Raising two productive boys who are now young men.
