Notes to
the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

September
30, 2016

 

NOTE 1
– Condensed Financial Statements

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company
without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which
include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
as of and for the period ended September 30, 2016 and for all
periods presented have been made.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed
financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s
December 31, 2015 audited financial statements as reported in its
Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results
for the full year ended December 31, 2016.

 

NOTE 2
– Going Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
limited assets, has incurred losses since inception, has negative
cash flows from operations, and has no revenue-generating
activities. Its activities have been limited for the past several
years and it is dependent upon financing to continue operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the
Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. It is management’s plan to acquire or merge
with other operating companies.

 

NOTE 3 -
Recent Pronouncement

 

On June
10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915). Amongst
other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition
of development stage entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the
distinction between development stage entities and other reporting
entities from US GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the
requirements for development stage entities to (1) present
inception-to-date information on the statements of income, cash
flows and shareholders’ equity, (2) label the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a
description of the development stage activities in which the entity
is engaged and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity
is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had
been in the development stage. The amendments are effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or
interim reporting period for which the financial statements have
yet to be issued. The Company has elected to early adopt these
amendments and accordingly have not labeled the financial
statements as those of a development stage entity and have not
presented inception-to-date information on the respective financial
statements.

 


NOTE 4
– Subsequent Events

 

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date
through the date the financial statements were issued and has
determined that there are no such events that would have a material
impact on the financial statements.

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

The U. S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) encourages
reporting companies to disclose forward-looking information so that
investors can better understand future prospects and make informed
investment decisions. This report contains these types of
statements. Words such as “may,” “expect,”
“believe,” “intend,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,”
“project,” or “continue” or comparable
terminology used in connection with any discussion of future
operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking
statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this
report. All forward-looking statements reflect our present
expectation of future events and are subject to a number of
important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

 

Executive
Overview

 

We have
not recorded revenues and are dependent upon financing to continue
basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans
from management, significant stockholders or third parties to meet
our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written
agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore, no one is obligated
to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise doubt as
to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plan is to
combine with an operating company to generate revenue.

 

As of the
date of this report, our management has not had any discussions
with any representative of any other entity regarding a business
combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a
financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of
development or growth, including entities without established
records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to
numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of
financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth
companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with
an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance
that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
Any business combination or transaction may likely result in a
significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present
stockholders of the Company.

 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be
complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic
conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some
industries and shortages of available capital, our management
believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived
benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived
benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among
other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which
additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity
for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means
for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key
employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of
securities. Potentially available business combinations may occur
in many different industries and at various stages of development,
all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and
complex.

 

If we
obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to raise
additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our common
stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that we would
issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration
requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The
purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to
our financial needs and the available exemptions to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not
currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also
note that if we issue more shares of our common stock, then our
stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of
their common stock.

 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

We have
not recorded revenues from operations since inception and have not
established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our
operating costs. We have relied primarily upon related parties to
pay for our operating expenses. At September 30, 2016 our cash
increased to $2,650 as compared to $235 at December 31, 2015 and
our total liabilities increased to $235,186 at September 30, 2016
as compared to $211,121 at December 31, 2015. The increase in total
liabilities primarily represents accounts payable of $5,300 for
professional services performed by or paid for by a stockholder,
along with loans of $8,700 and accrued interest of $10,065 incurred
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016.

 

We intend
to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and/or
third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no
assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to
continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon
our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or
enter into a merger with such company. The type of business
opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our
profitability for the long term.

 

During the
next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related to
the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to
meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant
stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance
of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for
expenses.

Results
of Operations

 

We did not
record revenues in either 2016 or 2015. General and administrative
expense decreased to $11,585 for the 2016 nine month period
compared to $12,750 for the 2015 nine month period. General and
administrative expense decreased to $3,085 for the 2016 third
quarter compared to $3,100 for the 2015 third quarter. The decrease
in general and administrative expense in the 2016 nine month period
primarily reflects reduced costs related to professional consulting
services and other expenses paid on our behalf.

 

Total
other expense increased to $10,065 for the 2016 nine month period
compared to $8,972 for the 2015 nine month period. Total other
expense increased to $3,427 for the 2016 third quarter compared to
$3,065 for the 2015 third quarter. The increase for the interim
periods was attributable to accrued interest on notes
payable.

 

Our net
loss decreased to $21,650 for the 2016 nine month period compared
to $21,722 for the 2015 nine month period. Our net loss increased
to $6,512 for the 2016 third quarter compared to $5,165 for the
2015 third quarter. Management expects net losses to continue until
we acquire or merge with a business opportunity.

 

Commitments
and Obligations

 

At
September 30, 2016 we recorded notes payable totaling $172,526
representing services received, as well as cash advances received
from related and third parties. All of the notes payable are
non-collateralized, carry interest at 8% and are due on demand.
Total accrued interest as of September 30, 2016 on all notes
payable was $49,260.

 

At
September 30, 2016 two lenders represent in excess of 95% of the
Company’s accounts payable and notes payable.

 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

 

We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources and would be considered material to
investors.

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

We qualify
as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As a
result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from
certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging
growth company, among other things, we will not be required
to:

 

 




 



·



Have an
auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;





 



 



 





 



·



Submit
certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory
votes, such as “say-on-pay” and
“say-on-frequency”





 



 



 





 



·



Obtain
shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved; and





 



 



 





 



·



Disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee
compensation.

Table of Contents




 

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial
statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.

 

We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1
billion; (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary
shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of
the last business day of our most recently completed third fiscal
quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1
billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year
period.

 


ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK

 

Not
applicable to smaller reporting companies.

 


ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to
make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report and he determined that our disclosure controls and
procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the
period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of
duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information.
Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to
remediate this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another
company.

 

Changes
to Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an
evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and
determined that there were no changes made in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30,
2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

ITEM 5.
OTHER INFORMATION

 

Departure
of Directors and Certain Officers

 

On July
28, 2016, Debi Lee resigned her positions as Director and
Secretary/Treasurer of Nova Star. The board of directors intends to
fill the vacancy on the board of directors at a later date. Mr.
Clayton will perform the duties of the Secretary/Treasurer until
another person is appointed to that office.

 

Amendments
to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws

 

On
September 13, 2016, Nova Star Innovations, Inc. filed Articles of
Domestication in the state of Wyoming; effectively moving the
Company’s state of domicile from Nevada to Wyoming. This
change of domicile did not result in any changes to the
organization of the Company, nor any changes in the outstanding
shares or percentage of shares held by the stockholders of the
surviving domestic corporation. However, due to the change of state
of incorporation the board of directors adopted new bylaws filed as
exhibit 3(ii) to this Form 10-Q.

ARTICLE 1.
OFFICES

 

1.1
Business Office. The
principal office of the corporation shall be located at any place
either within or outside the State of Wyoming as designated in the
corporation's most recent document on file with the Wyoming
Secretary of State, Division of Corporations. The corporation may
have such other offices, either within or without the State of
Wyoming as the board of directors may designate or as the business
of the corporation may require from time to time.

 

1.2
Registered Office. The
registered office of the corporation shall be located within the
State of Wyoming and may be, but need not be, identical with the
principal office. The address of the registered office may be
changed from time to time.

 

ARTICLE 2.
SHAREHOLDERS

 

2.1
Annual Shareholder Meeting. The annual
meeting of the shareholders shall be fixed by the board of
directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting.
If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday in
the State of Wyoming, such meeting shall be held on the next
succeeding business day.

 

2.2
Special Shareholder Meeting. Special
meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose or purposes described
in the meeting notice, may be called by the president, or by the
board of directors, and shall be called by the president at the
request of the holders of not less than ten percent (10%) of all
outstanding votes of the corporation entitled to be cast on any
issue at the meeting.

 

2.3 Place
of Shareholder Meeting. The board
of directors may designate any place, either within or without the
State of Wyoming, as the place of meeting for any annual or any
special meeting of the shareholders, unless by written consent,
which may be in the form of waivers of notice or otherwise, all
shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting designate a different
place, either within or without the State of Wyoming, as the place
for the holding of such meeting. If no designation is made by
either the directors or unanimous action of the voting
shareholders, the place of meeting shall be at the location of the
Corporation.

 

2.4
Notice of Shareholder Meeting. Written
notice stating the date, time, and place of any annual or special
shareholder meeting shall be delivered not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or
by mail, by or at the direction of the President, the board of
directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to any
other shareholder entitled by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Wyoming (the "Statutes") or the articles of incorporation
to receive notice of the meeting. Notice shall be deemed to be
effective at the earlier of: (1) when deposited in the United
States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as it
appears on the stock transfer books of the corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid; (2) on the date shown on the return
receipt if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the
addressee; (3) when received; or (4) 3 days after deposit in the
United States mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed to
an address other than that shown in the corporation's current
record of shareholders.

If any
shareholder meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or
place, notice need not be given of the new date, time and place, if
the new date, time and place is announced at the meeting before
adjournment. But if the adjournment is for more than 30 days or if
a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed,
then notice must be given pursuant to the requirements of the
previous paragraph, to those persons who are shareholders as of the
new record date.

 

2.5
Waiver of Notice. A
shareholder may waive any notice required by the Statutes, the
articles of incorporation, or these bylaws, by a writing signed by
the shareholder entitled to the notice, which is delivered to the
corporation (either before or after the date and time stated in the
notice) for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate
records.

 

A
shareholder's attendance at a meeting:

 

(a) waives
objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting,
unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to
holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because
of lack of notice or effective notice; and

 

(b) waives
objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting
that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting
notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter
when it is presented.

 

2.6
Fixing of Record Date. For the
purpose of determining shareholders of any voting group entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or
shareholders entitled to receive payment of any distribution, or in
order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper
purpose, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the
record date. Such record date shall not be more than 70 days prior
to the date on which the particular action, requiring such
determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If no record date is
so fixed by the board for the determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of, or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, the
record date for determination of such shareholders shall be at the
close of business on the day the first notice is delivered to
shareholders. If no record date is fixed by the board for the
determination of shareholders entitled to receive a distribution,
the record date shall be the date the board authorizes the
distribution. With respect to actions taken in writing without a
meeting, the record date shall be the date the first shareholder
signs the consent.

When a
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders has been made as provided in this Section, such
determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the
board of directors fixes a new record date which it must do if the
meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date
fixed for the original meeting.

 

2.7
Shareholder List. After
fixing a record date for a shareholder meeting, the corporation
shall prepare a list of the names of its shareholders entitled to
be given notice of the meeting. The shareholder list must be
available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning on the
earlier of 10 days before the meeting for which the list was
prepared or 2 business days after notice of the meeting is given
for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting,
and any adjournment thereof. The list shall be available at the
corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the
meeting notice in the city where the meeting is to be
held.

 

2.8
Shareholder Quorum and Voting Requirements.

 

2.8.1
Quorum. Except as otherwise required by the Statutes or the
articles of incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of
the corporation, represented by person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at each meeting of the shareholders. If a
quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of
directors, is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed
the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of
incorporation or the Statutes require a greater number of
affirmative votes.

 

2.8.2

of class, is entitled to one vote upon each m
