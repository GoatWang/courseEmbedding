2. These charts compare the Eventide Gilead Fund Class N’s performance to index performance over the periods shown. Performance will differ for other fund classes, based upon fees and commissions. The Growth of $10,000 Chart assumes Class N’s inception date of 8 July 2008 for the indices.
3. The returns shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or on the redemption of Fund shares. Because of ongoing market volatility, Fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
4. The S&P 500 is an index created by Standard & Poor’s of American stocks with the largest market capitalization. It is not an investment product available for purchase. The Russell Midcap Growth Index measures the performance of the U.S. equity mid-cap growth segment. It includes mid-cap companies with higher price-to-book ratios and forecasted growth. The volatility of the indices may be materially different than that of the Fund, and investors should not expect the Fund to achieve the same results as the indices listed. 
5. Performance figures for periods greater than 1 year are annualized. The Fund’s share classes have different inception dates. Class N has an inception date of 8 July 2008.  Class A and Class C have an inception date of 28 October 2009. Class I has an inception date of 2 February 2010. The indices assume an inception date of 8 July 2008.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Previously, this summary sheet sourced market risk data from Zephyr StyleADVISOR, including a 5-year measurement period. Other updates to this summary sheet include information intended to help investors assess performance and risk factors across near-term and longer-term periods (i.e., trailing 3-years and since inception) and risk data associated with the Fund’s benchmarks. The performance and risk factor comparisons are against the S&P 500 Total Return Index (“Index”). Alpha is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. It takes the volatility (price risk) of a fund and compares its risk-adjusted performance to the Index. Any excess return of the fund relative to the return of the Index is a fund’s alpha. Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to the Index. A beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the Index. R-Squared measures how a fund’s performance correlates with the Index’s performance and it can help assess how likely it is that beta is statistically significant. Standard Deviation of return measures the amount of variation in historical performance from period to period.
5. Annualized since inception market risk details assume inception date of 1 August 2008 and not Class N’s actual inception date of 8 July 2008, as only full month data is included in the market risk calculations.
There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses. Past performance is not assurance of future results.

2. These charts compare the Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund Class N’s performance to index performance over the periods shown. Performance will differ for other fund classes, based upon fees and commissions. The Growth of $10,000 Chart assumes the Fund’s inception date of 27 December 2012 for the indices.
3. The returns shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or on the redemption of Fund shares. Because of ongoing market volatility, Fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
4. The S&P 500 is an index created by Standard & Poor’s of American stocks with the largest market capitalization. It is not an investment product available for purchase. The Healthcare Blended Index is composed of equal parts of the S&P 400 Healthcare Index and the S&P 600 Healthcare Index from Fund inception on 27 December, 2012. The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index represents the biotechnology sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index. The secondary index for the Fund changed from the Healthcare Blended Index to the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index on April 1, 2017. This change was made because the Adviser believes that the composition of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index better reflects the risks and opportunities of the Fund’s portfolio. The performance of both indices will be shown for a period of one year. Thereafter, the performance of the Healthcare Blended Index will no longer be shown on the Summary sheet. The volatility of the indices may be materially different than that of the Fund, and investors should not expect the Fund to achieve the same results as the indices listed.

Investment Objective: The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund seeks current income while maintaining the potential for capital appreciation.  The Fund has significant flexibility to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in a broad universe of income-producing securities. These securities include debt and equity securities of companies in the U.S. and other markets around the world.  
These securities may include but are not limited to common stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), business development companies, yieldcos, master limited partnerships (MLPs), preferred stocks, corporate bonds, government agency bonds, certificates of deposit, municipal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, mortgage-backed securities, options, exchange traded notes, exchange traded funds and other investment companies (including mutual funds and closed-end funds). The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in companies whose securities may have legal or contractual restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid.
Investment Strategy: Eventide uses a two step process to select securities for the Fund. The investment process begins with a “top down” analysis to select a variety of asset classes that are believed to offer the best opportunity for current income and/or capital appreciation.  Factors considered include an assessment of current income opportunities, the potential for income growth, valuation, capital appreciation potential and/or portfolio risk/return attributes.  The second step is a fundamental “bottom-up” analysis to evaluate specific securities for inclusion in the portfolio. Eventide favors securities that, in its opinion, are attractively valued, provide attractive current income, provide income appreciation potential, provide capital appreciation potential, and/or help to reduce overall portfolio volatility.
Sub-Adviser: Eventide has retained Boyd Watterson Asset Management, LLC to manage some or all of the Fund’s assets allocated for investment in the intermediate-term bond portion of the portfolio. In selecting securities for investment by the Fund, Boyd Watterson employs a top-down approach to determine how to structure the bond allocation taking in to consideration duration, maturity, and sector allocation. Boyd Watterson then initiates a process of security analysis based on several factors including, but not limited to, economic trends, industry assessments and issuer specific credit fundamentals.
Values-based investing: Eventide aims to analyze each potential investment’s ability to operate with integrity and create value for customers, employees, the environment, and other key stakeholders.  While few companies may reach these ideals in every area of their business, these principles articulate the Advisor’s ideal characteristics of good corporate behavior.  The Advisor makes no guarantee that fund investments will meet any or all of these characteristics.

Performance is historic and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changing market conditions so that when redeemed, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. Investors cannot directly invest in an index and unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. To obtain the most recent month-end performance information and a current Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund prospectus please call the fund, toll free at 1-877-771-EVEN (3836).
Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund Class N expenses: Net Expenses 1.48%.
2. The numbers shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or on the redemption of Fund shares. Because of ongoing market volatility, Fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
3. The chart compares the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund Class N’s growth to index growth since inception, and assumes the Fund’s inception date of 15 July 2015 for the indices. Growth will differ for other fund classes, based upon fees and commissions.
4. The Multi-Asset Income Blend is a proprietary Eventide benchmark based on 60% MSCI All Country World Index (Net), 40% Barcap Aggregate Bond Index at inception, rebalanced monthly. The MSCI World All-Country World Index (Net) captures large and mid cap representation across 23 developed markets and 23 emerging markets. The volatility of the indices may be materially different than that of the Fund, and investors should not expect the Fund to achieve the same results as the indices listed.
5. The chart displays the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund Class N’s dividend and capital gains distributions for the periods shown. The distributions will differ for other fund classes, based upon fees and commissions. The total distribution may represent dividend and interest income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the fund is net profit. The characterization of income is an estimate only and subject to change for tax purposes.
6. NAV presented is as of the date of the respective quarter end.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Previously, this summary sheet sourced market risk data from Zephyr StyleADVISOR. Other updates to this summary sheet include information intended to help investors assess performance and risk factors associated with the Fund’s benchmarks. The performance and risk factor comparisons are against the S&P 500 Total Return Index (“Index”). Alpha is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. It takes the volatility (price risk) of a fund and com- pares its risk-adjusted performance to the Index. Any excess return of the fund relative to the return of the Index is a fund’s alpha. Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to the Index. A beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the Index. R-Squared measures how a fund’s performance correlates with the Index’s performance and it can help assess how likely it is that beta is statistically significant. Standard Deviation of return measures the amount of variation in historical performance from period to period.
7. Since inception market risk details assume inception date of 1 August 2015 and not Class N’s actual inception date of 15 July 2015, as only full month data is included in the market risk calculations.
 There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses. Past performance is not assurance of future results.

 There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses. Past performance is not assurance of future results.






Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to under-perform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Because of ongoing market volatility, the Funds performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
The Eventide Gilead Fund & Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds can also have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Funds can invest in private companies. Private investments include various risks including but not limited to lack of liquidity, capital commitment risk, and valuation risk. Private companies may not be financially profitable and have uncertain futures, subjecting them to additional risks. Investors in the Gilead Fund should be aware that companies in the technology industries have different risks including but not limited to products becoming obsolete, and entrance of competing products. Companies in the Industrial Sector also carry various risks including, but not limited to, risk related to debt loads and intense competition.
Investors in the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund should be aware that interest rates are at historic lows and may change at any time based on government policy.  In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. A rise in interest rates may result in volatility and increased redemptions, which in turn could result in the fund being forced to liquidate portfolio securities at disadvantageous prices. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The intermediate-term bond portion of the Fund’s portfolio may represent 0% to 100% of the Fund’s portfolio with an average duration of between two and eight years.
The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund may invest in other funds. If other funds are utilized, such underlying funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, your cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in underlying funds and may be higher than other mutual funds that do not invest in underlying funds. The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in “junk bonds.” Such securities are speculative investments that carry greater risks than higher quality debt securities. There are unique risks associated with REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks, convertible bonds, BDCs, and yieldcos that are covered in the Fund's prospectus and SAI. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate. 
An investor should consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information can be found in the prospectus, which can be obtained at www.eventidefunds.com or by calling 1-877-771-EVEN (3836). Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Eventide Mutual Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, Member FINRA, which is not affiliated with Eventide Asset Management, LLC.

Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai

Charlie, how did the fund perform for the year ending December 31, 2016?
The fund's share classes gained roughly 11%, trailing the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index and falling just behind the 11.96% return of the broader S&P 500®. However, the fund outpaced its peer group average.
Considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors weighed on the fund's relative results in the first six months of the year, penalizing my emphasis on growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries, and secondarily on cyclically sensitive stocks with improving fundamentals.
In the second half of the year, investors grew less defensive and focused more on company fundamentals. This "risk-on" attitude helped a number of the fund's holdings, particularly in the semiconductor space, where stock choices and an overweighting jointly made that industry easily our largest contributor. Positioning in systems software also added value.

Specifically, where did the fund run into problems versus the MSCI sector index?
Stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on relative results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing.
The first group was home to the fund's largest detractor, China-based online advertising provider 58.com. This out-of-benchmark stock was hurt by selling pressure related to the company's purchase of privately held rival Ganji.com, as well as the challenges of integrating Ganji and other recent acquisitions. Additionally, 58.com issued disappointing revenue guidance in November. Recently imposed regulations by local Chinese governments intended to curb real estate speculation – including higher down-payment requirements – played a part in the firm lowering expectations for property-related advertising on its platform.
I continued to believe in the longer-term prospects for this stock, as I saw it as a potential beneficiary of the growth of China's middle class, one of the broader themes I keep my eye on. For risk-management purposes, I reduced this position somewhat but retained most of it at period end.
Also detracting was an overweighting in electric automaker Tesla Motors, among the fund's top-10 holdings at period end. After hitting a high for the year in early April, the stock consolidated somewhat below that level for the remainder of the period. Investors remained cautious amid the company's recurring production problems and its decision to purchase solar panel maker SolarCity. With that said, Tesla increased production by an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016, and I believe the firm's rapidly increasing market share could alleviate many of its growing pains.
Finally, I'll mention untimely ownership of an out-of-benchmark position in DeNA, a Japan-based provider of online gaming and e-commerce services. Although the stock rose for the year overall, I increased our position here in December shortly before the share price dropped on allegations of inaccurate, plagiarized articles on Welq, its website for health care information. I continued to like DeNA because of the company's joint venture with Nintendo to support the latter's development of a mobile game platform. The first entry for this platform was the highly anticipated Super Mario Run, released in mid-December. Other games are already in the pipeline.
Overall, the fund's holdings of foreign stocks were a drawback this period amid the U.S. dollar's strong appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2016.

What about contributors?
A large overweighting in semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group was the fund's largest relative contributor, with our position rising 58% this period. The company attracted activist investors and went through a major restructuring process with new management. I considerably reduced this position as the stock advanced, taking profits along the way. 
Overweighting Micron Technology – a maker of DRAM, NAND flash and other kinds of digital memory – also stood out for its positive impact on our relative results. I increased this position as the shares fell to a mid-single-digit price-earnings (P/E) ratio early in 2016 – well below the broader market's P/E ratio. Based on my expectations for Micron's earnings in 2016, I thought this was far too pessimistic. This turned out to be a good call, as the stock enjoyed a sustained rally from mid-May through the end of December. I reduced this position, too, given the robust gains it delivered.
A non-benchmark stake in Japan-based Sumco, a producer of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers, proved timely as well. After a cyclical downturn for wafer demand and pricing depressed the stock in the first half of 2016, the supply-demand balance began to normalize in the second half of the year, leading to expectations of better pricing for wafer companies. I established a stake here in August. These developments helped our position post a 59% return for the period.

What is your outlook as of period end?While I expect global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, I am optimistic about longer-term trends for the major themes I've identified, such as cloud computing, software as a service (SaaS), big data, artificial intelligence and the "Internet of Things."
Over the past decade, services, internet and software companies have been steadily taking market share from hardware firms. The cloud and SaaS are better value propositions for customers. The advantages include smoothing capital expenditures, rationalizing hardware costs, eliminating the need to manage IT infrastructure and keeping clients on the cutting edge of technology.
More recently, we have witnessed the significant development of artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications such as image and voice recognition. This development has been driven by the vast amount of data collected in many internet-based applications, the material improvement in machine-learning algorithms and the significant reduction in unit computing costs.
I believe we are in the early to middle innings of this and many other paradigm shifts in the tech sector. Similar to the mainframe and client-server eras, I believe big shifts in profit pools and market capitalization are possible, and my goal is to monitor these changes closely and position the fund to take advantage of them. ■






Charlie Chai on opportunities in international tech companies:


"Consistent with my longstanding strategy, I continue to look for new ideas in the international markets, where many companies are undiscovered or underfollowed by research analysts. I believe these markets are a source of compelling growth opportunities.
"For example, in the consumer segment, internet services and e-commerce companies remain attractive growers, especially those that sit at the intersection of the social, mobile and local themes. In Asian markets – especially China, South Korea and Japan – these industries have generally seen a pace of innovation as fast as, if not faster than, their Western peers. This pace has been driven by a less intrusive regulatory environment and incumbent companies in certain industries that are much less mature.
"Internet finance is another area of rapid growth. Consumer credit offerings have very low penetration in markets such as China. And in Southeast Asia, smartphone adoption has started to resemble growth trends seen in China three years ago. I believe considerable long-term value will be created in this region.
"After a period of significant capital inflows, we've seen a recent decline in corporate fundraising activity, which I believe is very positive for existing internet companies because it means higher barriers to entry and less competition." 



Key Takeaways



The fund's share classes gained roughly 11% for the year ending December 31, 2016, lagging the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index.

Growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries favored by Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai struggled early in the year amid considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors.

Versus the MSCI sector index, stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing. Conversely, stock choices and an overweighting in semiconductors contributed most, while positioning in systems software also added value.

Although Charlie expects global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, he's optimistic about longer-term prospects for the major themes he's identified.





MARKET RECAP


The S&P 500® index returned 11.96% in 2016, rising sharply on post-election optimism for economic growth. The year began during a fairly volatile stretch, with stocks hampered by persistent oil-price weakness and U.S.-dollar strength. Markets regained momentum in February amid U.S. job gains, a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly seven-year uptrend intact. Markets tumbled briefly following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to exit the European Union – dubbed "Brexit" – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of all-time highs. For the year, energy (+27%) led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices, one in the spring and another in November. Telecommunication services (+23%) was close behind, as demand for dividend-paying equities was high early in the period. Cyclical sectors, including financials (+22%), industrials (+18%) and materials (+17%), also posted strong gains. Conversely, consumer staples (+5%) and consumer discretionary (+6%) lagged the index, the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brick-and-mortar retailers. Real estate (+3%) struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates, while health care (-2%) was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.



Performance Summary

Variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the insurer. The value of a variable annuity contract depends on the values of units of subaccounts of the separate account. Each subaccount purchases shares of a corresponding mutual fund. Subaccount investment performance is based on the performance of the mutual fund in which it invests, less insurance company charges made against the assets of the separate account. A subaccount is not a mutual fund. 
The information provided in this Performance Summary contains performance information for the fund, or class, and each variable subaccount, with comparisons over different time periods to the fund's relevant benchmarks – including an appropriate index as well as a group of similar funds whose average returns are compiled and monitored by an independent mutual fund research company. Figures for more than one year assume a steady compounded rate of return and are not a class' year-by-year results, which fluctuated over the periods shown. Fund performance numbers are net of all underlying fund operating expenses, but do not include any insurance charges imposed by your insurance company's separate account. If fund performance information included the effect of these additional charges, the total returns would have been lower. The performance table also contains performance information for certain insurance company subaccounts that invest in the fund. Each variable subaccount's performance, as shown, is net of all fees and expenses, including those charges imposed by your insurance company. Seeing the returns over different time periods can help you assess the performance against relevant measurements and across multiple market environments. The performance information includes average annual total returns and cumulative total returns and is further explained in this section.*
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss – investment returns, contract value, and, for variable income annuities, payment amounts are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted below. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. For month-end performance figures, please visit www.fidelity.com/annuityperformance or call Fidelity. The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions included in each communication.

                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh
Co-Founder, Gold Bullion International^




                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!
                        

S.S.
Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
