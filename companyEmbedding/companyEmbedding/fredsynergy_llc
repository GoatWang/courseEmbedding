Fred Merritt is founder and chief executive officer at Synergy Tech Consulting, a strategic consulting, staffing and technology services company headquartered in Atlanta, GA. Fred founded Synergy Tech Consulting in 2008 and remains very hands on in the firm’s day-to-day management.
 
Fred is currently a Veteran of the United States Army where he served prior to gravitating to work in the Healthcare IT consulting industry. After working for a Big Four consulting company, an independent opportunity arose so Fred took a risk to enter an emerging market that needed professionals with his specific skill set.
 
Throughout Synergy Tech’s history, Fred has remained focused on providing in-person, tailored services to help clients feel confident in the future of their organization. He set the foundation for Synergy helping bridge the gap between technical and clinical filling a need where clients had no idea where to start. He has a niche for formulating talented teams of professionals that have hard to find skillsets from analysts to certified project managers with both functional and technical expertise.
 
Fred opened two main branch offices, the other located in Kansas City, to offer regional coverage with local expertise. Working within the healthcare industry, Fred is most passionate about providing hands-on quality work, as he understands the direct impact. Fred always says that the thing that excites him the most about leading Synergy Tech is that the work they do has a direct impact on saving lives.
 
Synergy Tech has been recognized and has won numerous awards for its customer service, client satisfaction and culture. One of which is the Emerging Leadership award from Small Business Administration (SBA). Fred participated in 100+ hours of rigorous curriculum designed to enable participating businesses to engage in focused development and expansion strategies.
 
Fred received his Bachelors in Information System and Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from Virginia Commonwealth University. He currently resides in Atlanta, GA with his wife and two kids. They lead a foundation called the Synergy Tech Foundation, which was founded in memory of his late mother-in-law. The mission of the organization is to foster a welcoming environment for homeless people to find nutritional nourishment through healthy eating.

Review by Freeman Shanberg on 2016-08-15 



 I've had the couch for about 4 days now and so far I'm in love. It came earlier than expected. The diction men were uncommonly goodly and it didn't obtain ANY damages. The delineation is extraordinary true to color. It is a smaller sectional. I assembled by myself and it was sooo much easier than I thought. Probably took me about 30 mins or less. The room in my apartment is 11x15 and it unite PERFECTLY into the space. The couch is super comfy. It's not a drink in couch but it's also not Super hard. It's Just right. I really don't keep any REAL negatives only the pillows aren't really cute. But I bequeath be baldachin them with a different textile anyway. The look and caress is exactly what I've been searching for. I recommend this couch

						﻿Chocolate Ganache For Cupcakes – What Kind of Ganache Recipe You Should Use For Cupcake Decorations When it comes to chocolate ganache for cupcakes, there are many recipes you can follow, but picking the wrong technique can mean a disaster.Believe me, I’ve tried some chocolate ganache for cupcakes, and because I haven’t tired most of them before, I former up with some bad recipes that weren’t even interlock for use in cupcakes.Now, don’t procure me wrong here. None of the recipes were bogus ones, but some were meant for cakes coating and not for cupcake device piping.So what are the 2 highest kinds of chocolate ganache for cupcakes you should be looking for? Allow me to differentiate them for you here.Cream GanacheIn case you don’t know, the cream I’m referring to here is dairy based whipping cream that you can achieve from all major baking supplies stores.Cream Ganache is generally thicker in its consistency, and it bequeath clutch its massage well when you pip it out.And here’s the average technique I use for my cream chocolate ganache for cupcakes.Ingredients:1) 150g Dairy Whipping Cream2) 250g Chocolate, chopped3) 15g Melted ButterDirections:1) Combine the whipping cream with butter and heat over a coupled boiler until butter has melted. Turn off the fire.2) Combine all the chocolate into the combination from (1), and hire it sit in the hot cream compound for 10 minutes.3) Start stirring the chocolate. You’ll ordinance it has softened after the 10 minute wait. Keep stirring until all is well combined.4) Allow it to cool till it holds its shape. Once ready, use it for piping.Milk GanacheNow, this is the ganache that gives me the most problems when I first started out, because most milk ganache recipes are used for cake coating, not piping. That method you can erase milk ganache to be really wet and runny, even after it’s cooled down, forming it an undesirable chocolate ganache for cupcakes.However, I realised that when I vary the symbol of milk in my recipes, I can besides achieve a substantial consistency for piping out cupcake decorations.So be miserly of milk ganache recipes you see out there. Use the wrong one and you’ll modern up with a gangling mess.Here’s my technique for milk chocolate ganache for cupcakes.Ingredients:1) 80g Milk2) 200g Chocolate, choppedDirections:1) Heat the milk over a dual boiler until it starts to bubble. Turn off the fire.2) Combine all the chocolate into the heated milk, and charter it sit in the hot milk concoction for 10 minutes.3) Start stirring the chocolate. You’ll ordinance it has softened after the 10 minute wait. Keep stirring until all is well combined.4) Allow it to harden till it holds its shape. Once ready, use it for piping.As you can probably see, both recipes are very identical in preparation. So it shouldn’t manage you crave to learn how to rally them both.My Conclusion So now that you have both recipes, which chocolate ganache for cupcakes should you be using?In my personal opinion, always use the cream ganache. They smack better, are easier to task with, and allot ameliorate effect everytime. Only use milk ganache if you can’t find cream in your local area. Give both chocolate ganache for cupcakes a try. Find the one that suits you best, and above all, keep fun.

I am thumping pleased with my purchases.





Review by Darryl Kimple on 2017-04-14 



 I am giving this sectional 4 stars because it is what it was described to be. You can not expect too much for a sectional priced unbefitting $800. It does look impartial like it was pictured on the website. It is pretty comfortable, firmer, but that's what I was hoping for. The legs are sinisteru plastic . Had I not already scan about that in additional reviews I would probably been horrified by it, but I was prepared for it; and you really can't tell once it is all put together. Assembly is easy. The size is perfect for smaller spaces. The down side- it is not extraordinary hale at all. I reinforced all the folks between the back rests and seats, as well as the people of all three pieces. Even with being reinforced, the back feels like it could give method if someone jumped on it or leaned back with too much impel or weight. I have only had it for 3 days so I cannot comment on how well the relevant or cushions nuzzle up. If you recognize what you are purchasing, I would chat you will be relieved with this couch. Just don't expect the form and construction of a $3000 couch for $799.




Beautiful!!
Review by Sachiko Virgili on 2017-03-16 



 I'm really jocose with this ottoman. It matches the supplementary pieces in the room perfectly and is equitable the rectify size as well. The portrayal here is extremely accurate. Overall sort is excellent!

Review by Alix Koualeski on 2017-06-07 



 I am giving this sectional 4 stars because it is what it was described to be. You can not expect too much for a sectional priced unbefitting $800. It does look equitable like it was pictured on the website. It is pretty comfortable, firmer, but that's what I was hoping for. The legs are sinisteru plastic . Had I not already study about that in further reviews I would probably been horrified by it, but I was prepared for it; and you really can't advise once it is all put together. Assembly is easy. The size is whole for smaller spaces. The down side- it is not remarkably healthy at all. I reinforced all the kinsfolk between the back rests and seats, as well as the relatives of all three pieces. Even with being reinforced, the back feels like it could apportion fashion if someone jumped on it or leaned back with too much impel or weight. I own only had it for 3 days so I cannot comment on how well the applicable or cushions hold up. If you sense what you are purchasing, I would prattle you bequeath be pleased with this couch. Just don't expect the structure and construction of a $3000 couch for $799.





Review by Micheal Lipson on 2015-10-28 



 I emotions love passion this piece. Fits entire in my living room. Comfy and affordable. Assembly was a breeze.

It was attainable to assemble. Its extremely comfortable and looks really nice. The more items the tables, lamps, butt chair and the rug are al from Wayfair. Im jocose with them all.





Review by Ayanna Stodden on 2016-04-08 



 The overall comfort is good. The cloth is thin. I own the sectional covered with sheets until I posses an opportunity to apply scotch guard. I hold no complaints.

						﻿When It Comes To Building A Steelmaster, There's No Place Like Home Smack mark in the middle of the United States is Kansas, which is often called the Heart of America. When many Americans reckon of Kansas, most likely two things come to mind: the movie “The Wizard of Oz” and tornadoes. But for Robert Williams and his wife who currently live in Olathe, KS, this Midwestern sector is their home, so much so that they purchased a 10 acre scheme of farm anchor in Pamona, KS (about 45 miles from Olathe) on which they intend to live out their retirement years. After the Williams offspring bought their acreage in Pamona, they noted to build a shop on the property for tackle storage. “Before we bought our storage building, we kept our tractor and fresh channel outside in the weather,” says Robert.Kansas is situated in what many consider to be “Tornado Alley”—an department where 90 percent of tornadoes gambol to life because it is where cold, derisory music from Canada and the Rocky Mountains meets warm, moist melody from the Gulf of Mexico and hot, scornful harmonization from the Sonoran Desert. The mix of these conditions along with atomospheric instability produces intense thunderstorms which can sway to tornadoes. Ninety-four tornadoes were reported in Kansas during 2010, and the catalogue year for tornadoes in the department was in 2008 with 187 tornadoes confirmed. With this news in mind, the Williams had to make sure that the storage building they bought could withstand winds reaching at least 206 miles per hour, which carries enough fastness to gash the roof and walls off of well-constructed homes, overturn trains, and uproot most trees in a forest. “I saw a [SteelMaster building] and liked what I saw, so that is what we purchased to use as our farm storage building,” says Robert.For supplementary than 28 years, SteelMaster Buildings, which is located in Virginia Beach, VA, has manufactured, designed, and supplied pre-fabricated twisted steel structures to 40,000 customers located in every state of the United States, in 40 countries, and on seven continents around the world. “SteelMaster buildings are engineered for life,” says Michelle Wickum, the company's employer of marketing. “Our steel buildings are furthermore built to meet the wind loads of their destination whether that's in Kansas or on the coast of Florida. They remain maintenance liberate for a lifetime thanks to the company's use of Galvalume Plus Coating which offers strength, esteemed corrosion resistance, and an beguiling flexible frontage that provides creditable heat reflectivity.” Each SteelMaster building further comes with a 30-year mill-backed warranty by ArcelorMittal (NYSE MT). Along with the backing of his wife and two friends, Robert erected the building in November 2009 and flawless by building the later walls in June of 2010. “I built the end walls using 2x6 lumber and red metal siding,” says Robert. “The tile was poured as a monolithic 6" slab with thickened sides that sit on piers that are 12" breadth and 5 foot deep.  The piers are placed every 6 foot around the frontier of the building.  I am appreciative that all the allied supplied with the building interlock as designed, and I'm pretty sure it commit trestle up to most of the weather Kansas can lob at it.” Robert has this to prattle to others who are about to begin construction of their have SteelMaster building. “Read the construction manual, and then dub the technical field at SteelMaster and alert them the size of your building and question them about the finest procedure of putting the arches together.  Also ask them to explain why it is so eminent to put the insignificant angles on the twisted sections to retain the curved sections from beginning as you erect it.” In appendage to storage buildings, SteelMaster's steel and metal pre-engineered buildings are designed for a broad scope of residential and commercial applications including garages, workshops, carports, metal barns, Quonsets, airplane hangars, RV storage, roofing systems, military buildings, commercial warehousing, and industrial storage as well as a wide variety of custom building applications including athletic facilities, retail stores, churches, bus stops, smoke shacks, doggie dorms, and correctional facilities.

Review by Delmar Skogen on 2017-01-15 



 It's tiring to order furniture online, but this jell is great! Great color, very comfy, look elegant. We achieve a heap of compliments on our new set. Pros: Great Value Cons: Wish they were a seldom deeper, but that's a personal preference.





Review by Eddy Bunkers on 2015-11-07 



 I've had the couch for about 4 days now and so far I'm in love. It came earlier than expected. The delivery men were remarkably substantial and it didn't retain ANY damages. The delineation is very true to color. It is a smaller sectional. I assembled by myself and it was sooo much easier than I thought. Probably took me about 30 mins or less. The room in my apartment is 11x15 and it interlock PERFECTLY into the space. The couch is super comfy. It's not a imbibe in couch but it's moreover not Super hard. It's Just right. I really don't have any REAL negatives only the pillows aren't really cute. But I cede be shade them with a different structure anyway. The look and fondle is exactly what I've been searching for. I recommend this couch





Review by Andy Mcmorran on 2017-03-22
