                those of our other group companies. We give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving marketing communications and will in certain circumstances 
                need to obtain your consent before sending such communications to you. Further detail can be found on the applicable Site and in each marketing communication

Cookies and similar technologies

                All our Sites use cookies and similar technical tools to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide.
            

                Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and 
                sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when 
                you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Cookies cannot 
                be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in 
                the domain that issued the cookie.
            

                We may use cookies to:
            

remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. 
                    This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;
                
remember your login session so you can move from one page to another within the Site;
store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;
customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of Site for you;
record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;
collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site; and
gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a 
                    “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county 
                    and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements 
                    on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and 
                    about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk. 
                    (Please email us at cookies@euromoneyplc.com if you have any queries about cookies)


                Some of the cookies used by our Sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services (such as interest based advertising 
                directed at your market segment) on our behalf. To see a list of the cookies and similar technologies used on this Site and instructions on how to

                Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. 
                You can also learn more about cookies in general by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org

                turning off cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.
            

Email tracking: So that we can better understand our users' needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the 
                most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are 
                small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links 
                within the message. Any other purposes for which Euromoney wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used 
                for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.
            

Consents and opt-outs


                You can give your consent to or opt out of particular uses of your data as indicated above by:

Informing us by email, post or phone; or
Updating your preferences on the applicable Site;

Disclosures


                Information collected at one Site may be shared between Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, Institutional Investor Inc. and other group companies for the 
                purposes listed above. Your personal data may also be sold to other companies in the form of lists and directories, but only after permission from 
                you in accordance with the provisions above. We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties, including, without limitation, professional 
                advisers, or governmental or State institutions or regulatory authorities, where necessary in order to exercise or defend legal rights or where required by law.

                transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.
            

Public forums, message boards and blogs


                Some of our Sites make message boards, blogs or other facilities for user generated content available and users can participate in these facilities. 
                Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.
            

Transfers outside the EEA


                Services on the Internet are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always limited to one country. 
                Euromoney Institutional Investor plc may transfer your personal data, for the purposes listed above, to other group companies, service providers or other 
                third parties which may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may not give the level of protection to personal data as within the UK. 
                This will include transfers to Institutional Investor Inc. in the US (and Institutional Investor Inc. will collect some data directly from you, in relation to the 
                Sites which it operates) and to third parties who provide us with email and marketing services. Where we conduct any transfers we will take all steps reasonably 
                necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            
Confidentiality and Security of Your Personal Data
We are committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or alteration.

                security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and 
                security features described above to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have implemented information security policies, rules and technical measures to 
                protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification
unlawful destruction or accidental loss

All our employees, contractors and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf, for the purposes listed above), who have access to, and 
                are associated with the processing of your personal data, are obliged to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out 
                the services they are performing for us. We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as 
                credit card details and bank account number. How to Access, Update and Erase your Personal Information

NEW YORK, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Partners III LLC, a shareholder of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. ("NYC REIT" or the "Company"), announced today that it has issued an open letter to its fellow NYC REIT shareholders urging them to once again vote against the shareholder-unfriendly proposals to amend the Company's Charter at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held on June 27, 2017.
The full text of the letter follows below:
June 1, 2017








To our Fellow Shareholders,
VOTE NO AT THE UPCOMING ANNUAL MEETING
Like you, we are shareholders of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. ("NYC REIT"). Try as we might, we were unable to acquire our 100 shares before the record date for the June 27, 2017 annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") so we will be unable to vote our shares at the upcoming Annual Meeting. We knew this at the time we acquired our shares. We also knew at the time that the shares had fallen at least 10% in value from their date of sale to you, notwithstanding during the same period one of the greatest surges in the value of New York City real estate. We also knew at the time that the quarterly distributions to shareholders which you had been receiving were NOT dividends from profits or earnings, which management has finally admitted.  Rather, they consisted of your own capital investment and proceeds from borrowings being paid back to you.  
We were aware of even more. NYC REIT is managed by an external advisor controlled by Nick Schorsch, whose controlled advisory companies have recently had serious issues.  For example, VEREIT, Inc. is a multibillion dollar net lease formed and advised by Mr. Schorsch's affiliates, is under investigation for manipulation of earnings that occurred under his advisory watch, with a criminal trial scheduled for this June. Separately in 2016, Massachusetts regulatory authorities found that his affiliates had manipulated shareholder voting procedures. One of Mr. Schorsch's brokerage affiliates filed for bankruptcy in 2016. Since he has withdrawn from raising new money, Mr. Schorsch has been on a tear to convert his one-year management contracts into long term 20 year contracts locking in the fee income for himself and diminishing the value of the shares.
So why did we purchase NYC REIT shares?  Because we would consider an increased investment in the Company.  But before doing so, we believe that shareholders must ONCE AGAIN reject the basket of outrageous self-serving and entrenchment-minded proposals to amend the Company's Charter that are up for consideration at the Annual Meeting, which were recommended and approved by the handpicked Schorsch Board of Directors (the "Board"). These value destroying proposals, the most egregious of which are described below, eliminate valuable shareholder protections and open up the door for unlimited and unfettered Schorsch control of your investment. These shareholder-unfriendly proposals include:

A proposal to end the stated Fiduciary Obligation of the Board to shareholders, including the specific fiduciary duty to supervise the relationship with the Company's advisor.  
A proposal to allow the Board to extend the agreement with the Schorsch-controlled advisor for an indefinite period of time rather than limiting it to one-year renewals.  
A proposal to limit your access to the books and records of the Company.  
A proposal to allow the Board to interpret the Company's Charter rather than the state mandated "Blue Sky" guidelines which were designed for your protection.  
A proposal which would prevent the Schorsch advisory agreement from being terminated on 60 days' written notice.  
A proposal which would allow the Board to privately sell shares in your Company, which could chill good-faith purchase offers for NYC REIT.  
A proposal to eliminate the ability of 10% of the shareholders to call a special meeting, giving the Board unfettered authority to increase this threshold by 5x.  
A proposal to eliminate the current shareholder majority voting requirement before the Board can take specified actions.  
A proposal to eliminate the current "independent director" requirement as presently stated.  
A proposal to eliminate from the "relevant experience" requirement that independent directors have prior real estate experience.  
A proposal which would allow the Board to pursue non-real estate investments. 
A proposal to no longer require liquidation of the Company if your shares are not publicly registered for trading within six years.

If you care about the value of your investment, want to see an active fair market for your shares, and importantly, retain the ability to select and hold the Board and your management team accountable, then you MUST vote against all of these self-serving proposals at the upcoming Annual Meeting.  We urge you to discuss these crucial issues that threaten your rights and seek to undermine the shareholder franchise with your financial advisors TODAY.  For the record, we would be happy to openly debate our position with members of the Board of NYC REIT.
Sincerely,
Michael Ashner & John AlbaCove Partners III LLC

ATLANTA, Nov. 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Roberts Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE MKT: RPI) (the "Company") today announced that it has signed a definitive stock purchase agreement with A-III Investment Partners LLC (A-III), a joint venture between affiliates of Avenue Capital Group and C-III Capital Partners LLC, which is controlled by Island Capital Group LLC.  Under the agreement, A-III has agreed to purchase $12.0 million of the Company's common stock at a purchase price per share to be determined based on an estimate of the Company's closing date net asset value, which is currently expected to be approximately $1.40 per share.  At the closing, the Company also would issue to A-III warrants to purchase up to an additional $38.0 million of the Company's common stock at an exercise price equal to the same purchase price per share.  The actual purchase price for the shares, number of shares to be issued and exercise price of the warrants will be determined immediately before closing and will be subject to a post-closing adjustment upon the sale of the Company's four existing properties as discussed further below.  
The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Company's board of directors, is subject to receipt of shareholder approval at a special meeting of the Company's shareholders, expected to be held by mid-February of 2015, and other customary closing conditions.  Upon the closing, a change in control of the Company would result, with A-III becoming the largest single shareholder of the Company, owning approximately 46% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 41% on a diluted basis assuming conversion of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest of the Company's operating partnership into Company common stock.
Avenue Capital Group is a global investment firm with approximately $14.1 billion under management.  Island Capital Group is a leading real estate merchant banking firm that controls portfolio companies and investment funds – including C-III Capital Partners – that collectively own, manage and/or are the servicer for approximately $135 billion of commercial real estate related assets.
Mr. Charles S. Roberts, Roberts Realty's President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated:  "Since June 2011, we have evaluated a range of strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing long-term shareholder value, including a potential sale, merger, other business combination, or recapitalization of the Company.  We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Island Capital Group and Avenue Capital Group, two global investment managers.  If the transaction closes as we expect, the Company will repay all of its debt, will have approximately $1.75 million in working capital, and will be under new leadership with access to a wide array of new potential sources of capital and investment opportunities to fuel the future growth of the Company."  
Mr. Edward Gellert, Senior Portfolio Manager - Avenue Real Estate Strategy, noted:  "We are pleased to join with C-III Capital Partners in this investment and look forward to using our combined network of industry relationships to identify new opportunities to create value for shareholders."
Mr. Robert Lieber, Executive Managing Director of Island Capital Group and C-III Capital Partners, added: "We are eager to partner with the principals of Avenue and their team of seasoned professionals.  This investment in the Company presents us with a unique opportunity to continue enhancing our portfolio of strategic real estate assets."
Immediately after the closing, the Company's board would be composed of seven directors:  two directors affiliated with A-III, four new independent directors, and Mr. Roberts, who will continue to serve as a director of the Company for one year after the closing.  The Company's current management would be replaced by A-III Manager LLC, an external management company owned by A-III, pursuant to a management agreement between the Company and A-III Manager.  Key personnel of A-III Manager or its affiliates will be appointed as officers of the Company.  The Company's headquarters would be moved to New York City and the name of the Company would be changed. 
The post-closing company is expected to pursue a flexible real estate investment strategy and does not currently anticipate focusing on developing and constructing Atlanta multifamily apartment communities.  Given the change in focus of the Company's business, it is expected that the Company would sell its four land parcels, all of which are under development and are located in metropolitan Atlanta.  If the actual net sales proceeds of the four properties are less than the estimated amount used to calculate the closing date net asset value, the Company will issue to A-III, as a purchase price adjustment, an additional number of shares of common stock, and the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced to be equal to the adjusted purchase price per share.
After the closing, Mr. Roberts will be an Executive Vice President of the Company until one year from the closing date.  He will be responsible for the marketing process for the properties, including positioning the properties for sale, identifying buyers, and negotiating the terms of sale.  All sales will be subject to approval by the Company's board of directors.  
During the due diligence phase of the transaction, an error was discovered in the calculation of the 95% gross income test for purposes of the Company's qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code in the tax year ending December 31, 2009.  As a result, the Company's board of directors, including its audit committee, concluded on November 17, 2014 that the Company has failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the tax year ending December 31, 2009 and for the periods since that date, and, accordingly, the Company's previously issued financial statements included in its SEC filings after December 31, 2008 should no longer be relied upon.  With the assistance of its independent accountants, the Company is in the process of determining the effect of its failure to qualify as a REIT during those periods on the Company's previously filed historical financial statements and on its interim financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014.  When the Company completes that determination, it will disclose it publicly and make any required SEC filings.  The Company expects to be able to elect REIT status again in 2015 or 2016.
The Company's articles of incorporation presently limit ownership by any one shareholder to 3.7% of the outstanding shares of its common stock, except that Mr. Roberts can beneficially own up to 35% of the outstanding shares.  To permit A-III to invest $12.0 million, the Company agreed in the stock purchase agreement to amend its articles of incorporation to eliminate the ownership restrictions as a condition to closing.
The stock purchase agreement includes customary representations and warranties, and the closing is subject to standard closing conditions.  Each party has the right to terminate the stock purchase agreement for the reasons described in the stock purchase agreement.
A-III's financial advisor was The CenterCap Group, LLC.  A-III was represented by Hunton & Williams LLP.  Roberts Realty was represented by Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP and Alston & Bird LLP.  
The above description of the proposed transaction is only a summary, and you are encouraged to read the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company intends to file shortly after this press release is issued and which will be available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  The stock purchase agreement will be filed as an exhibit to that Form 8-K.
