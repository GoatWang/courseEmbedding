                    My family loves this area! Located near the intersection of Cherry St Extension and Young Road. Very quiet with zero 'through' traffic, very friendly neighbors, and easy to get to Cherry St, Peach St, 38th St, I-90, and I-79. 
Nice mix of older homes and newer construction with a few lots still available for new homes.
Be sure to be in town for the neighborhood's Fourth of July party! Great food and a first row seat to a fantastic fireworks display!
