      QLT Inc. is a biotechnology company that develops and markets photodynamic
      therapeutic products—drugs that are activated by exposure to light.
      The company has a history of developing treatments for cancer, but its
      greatest commercial success is Visudyne, a light-activated treatment for
      age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people
      over age 50. Other pharmaceutical products in the company's
      development pipeline include treatments for prostate cancer, skin cancer,
      and male pattern baldness. The acquisition of Atrix Laboratories in 2004
      gave QLT a second marketable pharmaceutical product named Eligard, which
      is a treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
    


        Origins
      


      Without question, the single most influential figure in QLT's
      history was Dr. Julia Levy, whose pioneering scientific work achieved
      commercial success when she was forced to trade her lab coat for the
      attire of a chief executive officer. Levy was born Julia Coppens in 1934,
      beginning her life in Singapore, where her father worked as an executive
      for a Dutch bank. Levy's father, Guillaume Coppens, sent his wife
      and two daughters to stay with relatives in British Columbia, Canada, on
      the eve of World War II, fearing for his family's safety. Guillaume
      Coppens's anxiety was justified; he was captured by the Japanese
      and interned in Indonesia, surviving the ordeal but devastated by the
      experience. He joined his family in British Columbia after the war, unable
      to work for the remainder of his life. "My recollection of my life
      was: 'Don't upset your father,'" Levy
      reflected in a July 23, 2003 interview with 
      
        Contemporary Canadian Biographies
      
      .
    

      Levy's mother, who served as the motivation for QLT's
      greatest commercial success, supported the family by working as a
      physiotherapist. After high school, Levy spent a year serving as a file
      clerk at BC Hydro to supplement the scholarships she had earned to attend
      the University of British Columbia, where she studied microbiology and
      immunology. After earning her undergraduate degree in 1955, Levy went
      overseas to obtain her doctorate, attending the University of
      London's National Institute for Medical Research. She earned her
      Ph.D. in experimental pathology in 1959 and returned to the University of
      British Columbia, where she began conducting research on cancer.
    

      After her first marriage ended in divorce, Levy married a physicist at the
      University of British Columbia named Edwin Levy. The couple married in
      1969 and several years later purchased a holiday property on Sonora Island
      in British Columbia, where they planned to build a cottage. It was the
      turning point in Levy's career. After a decade of conducting
      research, Levy had little to show for her efforts, at least in comparison
      to what she produced after she handed a machete to her son Ben and asked
      him to clear the weeds on the property. Ben, who was born during
      Levy's first marriage, was seven years old at the time, and he took
      to the task with zeal, slashing away at the underbrush with what amounted
      to a sword. Ben came across some cow parsley and hacked away at it with
      sufficient enthusiasm to cover his skin in fluid from the plant.
      "It was a hot day," Ben remembered in a July 6, 1996
      interview with the 
      
        Vancouver Sun
      
      , describing the fateful day on Sonora Island. "The sun came out,
      and all of a sudden, I just started blistering everywhere, especially on
      my arms."
    

      When Levy returned to work, she asked her colleagues at the University of
      British Columbia about what might have caused her son's skin to
      blister. She learned that a substance in cow parsley's 
       leaves can attack and destroy certain kinds of tissue, skin cells
      included, but only when activated by exposure to light. Levy was intrigued
      and began thinking about the potential of photo-activated drugs, embarking
      on research that would lead to her co-invention of photodynamic therapy
      (PDT). Levy's work focused on a two-step process that began with
      the intravenous injection of a drug. After the drug entered the
      patient's bloodstream, it collected where abnormal blood vessels
      were being formed. Once the drug was concentrated around the flawed blood
      vessels, it was activated by a dose of non-thermal laser light, triggering
      a process that destroyed abnormal cells.
    

      While Levy's scientific research found a pioneering and focused
      direction, her work with a team of researchers at the University of
      British Columbia centered on studying antibodies for treating various
      forms of cancer. Guiding a drug through development, the various stages of
      regulatory approval, and through numerous clinical trials represented one
      of the most arduous and time-consuming achievements in the business world,
      a monumental task that was even more challenging for the research team in
      Vancouver. In the beginning of the 1980s, the Canadian biotechnology
      industry did not exist. At the time, the only way to produce a drug was to
      sell the rights to a foreign pharmaceutical company. Levy and her
      colleagues turned to the University of British Columbia for support, but
      the university refused. With nowhere else to turn, and wishing to remain
      in control of their discoveries, the research team decided to start their
      own business. In 1981, Levy mortgaged her house to come up with $50,000, a
      sum matched by her cofounders, John Brown, Jim Miller, Anthony Phillips,
      and Ron MacKenzie. They named their company Quadra Logic Technologies,
      renting one room above a bakery to house their office and laboratory. Each
      of the founders continued to work at the university, unable to draw a
      salary from their fledgling venture, and conducted their research above
      the bakery during off hours.
    

      In many respects, Quadra Logic, or QLT as the company eventually became
      known, served as Levy's vehicle to deliver her scientific findings
      to the commercial market. Starting out in 1981, however, Levy and her
      colleagues were many years away from enjoying any commercial success. The
      path describing a drug's progression from discovery through
      development, regulatory approval, and commercialization promised to be an
      unnerving journey—particularly for a group not versed in the
      intricacies of clearing regulatory and clinical hurdles. Because the
      market in the United States was integral to the company's success,
      approval needed to be obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA), requiring a process that Levy later described as akin to playing
      "Russian Roulette," as quoted in the October 22, 2002 issue
      of 
      
        Canadian Chemical News.
      
       "And that's really ugly because you're not the
      master of your fate," she added.
    


        Photofrin in the Mid-1980s
      


      The young QLT scored its first success with a drug that already had begun
      progressing along the path toward commercialization. Levy convinced her
      partners to acquire the rights to Photofrin, a light-activated drug in the
      midst of clinical trials as a cancer treatment. In 1986, QLT formed an
      alliance with a larger pharmaceutical company—something nearly
      every small biotechnology company like QLT needed to do to survive. The
      company reached an agreement with American Cyanamid to co-develop
      Photofrin, brokering a deal that gave it equity, which enabled it to fund
      the drug's development. The alliance was important for another
      reason because American Cyanamid, practiced in the vagaries of drug
      development and clinical trials, provided the QLT team with an invaluable
      tutorial in shepherding a drug through to commercialization. "That
      was a very fortunate experience for us," Levy reflected in an
      October 2002 interview with 
      
        Canadian Chemical News
      
      . "Because with biotechnology companies they'll take the
      science forward to a certain level and then they'll license it out
      to a large pharma company, and the pharma company (will) say,
      'Thank you very much, we'll see you later,' and does
      the development."
    

      The partnership ended before Photofrin gained approval, but it ended on
      beneficial terms for QLT. American Cyanamid was acquired by another
      company in the early 1990s, which gave the rights to Photofrin back to
      QLT, which by that point had another drug in its development pipeline. The
      idea for the drug came from Levy, who drew her inspiration for developing
      photodynamic therapy from her son and her motivation for creating what
      would be her career's crowning achievement from her mother.
    


        The Development of Visudyne in the 1990s
      


      During the mid-1980s, Levy's mother began to lose her sight. She
      was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, an incurable
      deterioration of the central portion of the retina and the leading cause
      of blindness in people over the age of 50. Levy had spent her entire
      career studying cancer and she noticed a similarity between macular
      degeneration and her chosen field of study: both diseases manifested
      themselves by forming new, abnormal tissue.
    

      Levy's mother suffered from "wet" macular
      degeneration, in which flawed blood vessels bleed under the retina,
      damaging the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. Levy focused
      her work on developing a drug that targeted the abnormal blood vessels and
      destroyed them when activated by light, eventually creating QLT's
      defining pharmaceutical product, Visudyne.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          QLT has the capability to maximize all the exciting products in our
          development pipeline and leverage our unique drug delivery
          technologies. We are also actively seeking to expand our pipeline
          through both in-house development and external alliances. Combining
          the best in science and business, all of us at QLT are committed to
          helping enrich the lives of thousands of patients.
        



      The development of Visudyne became a crusade of sorts for Levy, one whose
      success was jeopardized when QLT's partnership with American
      Cyanamid was terminated. Between 1992 and 1995, the company's
      survival was at stake as it sought to navigate on its own. Levy recalled
      the period in her October 2002 interview with 
      
        Canadian Chemical News
      
      , remembering "really putting on blinkers and just concentrating on
      trying to get approval for Photofrin, and taking our preclinical work with
      [Visudyne] forward." She added: "We could have gone under 
       then if we hadn't taken very major measures to pull ourselves
      together and focus, focus, focus."
    

      After a decade of work, QLT received the nod of approval it had labored to
      obtain in 1995, when Photofrin was accepted by the FDA as a marketable
      drug. QLT became the only company with approval to market a
      light-activated pharmaceutical product in the field of photodynamic
      therapy. Winning approval for her first drug was a celebratory moment for
      Levy, but she barely had time to mark the occasion before her
      responsibilities broadened. All of QLT's other founders departed in
      1995, leaving Levy, who had served variously as the company's chief
      scientific officer and vice-president, as the only one to lead the
      company. Before the year was through, Levy accepted the titles of
      president and chief executive officer, becoming the company's
      corporate and scientific leader as it endeavored to win approval for its
      second drug, Visudyne.
    


        Commercial Success in the 2000s
      


      Under Levy's leadership, QLT recorded the greatest financial growth
      in its history. Photofrin gave the company the steady stream of revenue it
      had worked for years to secure, but the lifeblood of its operations,
      Visudyne, would deliver QLT's most strident financial growth.
      Visudyne won approval from the FDA in 2000, the same year Levy sold
      Photofrin to Quebec-based Axcan Pharma Inc. QLT won approval for Visudyne,
      which it marketed in partnership with Novartis Ophthalmics, in April,
      recording its first sales from the drug in the second fiscal quarter of
      2000, when the company collected $25 million. During the second quarter of
      2001, the company generated $56 million from the sale of Visudyne, as its
      use spread throughout more than 50 countries. The U.S. market represented
      the company's single biggest market, accounting for two-thirds of
      Visudyne sales and enabling it to join an elite group of biotechnology
      companies. "Of the 490 publicly traded biotechnology companies
      around the world," Levy declared in the Winter 2001 issue of 
      
        Buyside,
      
       "only 14 are profitable, and QLT is one of them. Visudyne is an
      important reason for our growth," she added. "It was the
      largest ophthalmic product launch on record, with sales of $150 million in
      the first 12 months."
    

      After years of working to bring Visudyne to market and watching its sales
      mushroom with each passing fiscal quarter, Levy decided to give up her
      management responsibilities at QLT. She departed in 2002, after 21 years
      at the company, passing the titles of president and chief executive
      officer to Paul Hastings. Hastings started his career in the
      pharmaceutical industry in 1984 with Hoffman La Roche, the first of
      several companies he worked for in the industry. Before joining QLT,
      Hastings served as president and CEO of Axys Pharmaceuticals.
    

      Hastings's task at QLT was one Levy presumably would not have
      relished. Sales of Visudyne continued to rise as the reins of leadership
      passed from Levy to Hastings, but analysts demanded more. QLT was
      dependent almost entirely on the sale of Visudyne, a dependence that some
      industry observers described as a weakness. One analyst, in the January
      24, 2003 issue of 
      
        The America's Intelligence Wire
      
      , typified the assessment of QLT by the financial community, saying,
      "The big issue for them is what are you going to do next."
      Although Visudyne was the only treatment for macular degeneration on the
      market, QLT was expected to contend with its first competition as early as
      2005, when Eyetech, a biotechnology company working in collaboration with
      Pfizer, Inc., was expected to win approval for its macular degeneration
      drug Macugen.
    

      Hastings's challenge was to build QLT's business beyond
      Visudyne. The company had two other products under development,
      Tariquidar, a cancer treatment, and QLT0074, a male baldness treatment,
      but Hastings realized he needed to take a more aggressive approach to
      augmenting the company's business. In early 2004, he earmarked $500
      million in cash to develop the company's product pipeline and quell
      analysts' cries for a more diversified product offering. "We
      are looking to continue to build the pipeline by bringing in-house new
      technologies, licensing things in, and making acquisitions of products or
      companies," Hastings announced in the February 2, 2004 issue of 
      
        Investor's Business Daily
      
      . Toward this end, Hastings completed a deal that promised a more a
      balanced QLT in the years ahead. In November 2004, QLT completed a merger
      with Atrix Laboratories, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company with a
      pipeline of products and drug delivery platforms. Among the immediate
      gains of the merger was QLT's ability to market one of
      Atrix's products, Eligard, a treatment for prostate cancer. As
      Hastings prepared for the future, further deals were expected, as he
      sought to build on Levy's legacy and create a leading, diversified
      biotechnology company.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying 2015 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). All of the following amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and "forward looking information" within the meaning of the Canadian securities legislation which are based on our current expectations and projections. Words such as "anticipate," "project," "potential," "goal," "believe," "expect," "forecast," "outlook," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "should," "may," "assume," "continue" and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify our forward-looking statements and forward-looking information. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of QLT to be materially different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and forward-looking information. Many such risks, uncertainties and other factors are taken into account as part of our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements and forward-looking information.  The following factors, among others, including those described under Item 1 A. Risk Factors in this Report, could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking information:   our continued pursuit of strategic alternatives, or our decision to discontinue such pursuit, and the uncertainty of whether we will be successful in our efforts;   risks and uncertainties related to our decision, ability and timing to effect the Aralez Distribution and the associated tax consequences of the Aralez Distribution for the QLT shareholders;   the risk that the closing of the Private Placement contemplated under the Share Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement may not occur for any reason, including due to a condition of the closings not being satisfied;   our ability to retain or attract key employees and executives;   the anticipated timing, cost and progress of the development of our technology and clinical trials including the anticipated timing to commence and obtain results from the natural history study and pivotal clinical trials of QLT091001;   the anticipated timing of regulatory submissions for QLT091001, including the timing and outcome of our evaluation of a potential submission to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") for conditional approval;   the anticipated timing for receipt of, and our ability to maintain, regulatory approvals for product candidates, including QLT091001;   our ability to successfully develop and commercialize QLT091001, including the impact of competition and pricing;   existing governmental laws and regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, governmental laws and regulations;   the scope, validity and enforceability of our and third party intellectual property rights;   the anticipated timing for receipt of, and our ability to obtain and, if applicable, maintain, orphan drug designations and/or qualification as a new chemical entity for our synthetic retinoid;   receipt of the Laser Earn-Out Payment (as defined and described under Note  Table of Contents   receipt of all or part of the contingent consideration pursuant to the asset purchase agreement with Mati Therapeutics, Inc. ("Mati") related to Mati's successful development and sales of products based on the punctal plug drug delivery technology (the "PPDS Technology");   our ability to effectively market and sell any future products;   changes in estimates of prior years' tax items and results of tax audits by tax authorities; and   unanticipated future operating results.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements and forward-looking information contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore such statements and information included in this Report may not prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such statements and information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements and information or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Any forward-looking statement and forward-looking information speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except to fulfill our obligations under the applicable securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any such statement or information to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date on which it is made.  Business Overview  QLT is a biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative ocular products that address the unmet medical needs of patients and clinicians worldwide. Our operations consist of clinical development programs focused on our synthetic retinoid, QLT091001, for the treatment of certain age-related and inherited retinal diseases caused by retinal pigment epithelium protein 65 ("RPE65") and lecithin: retinol acyltransferase ("LRAT") gene mutations. QLT091001 is an orally administered synthetic retinoid replacement for 11-cis-retinal, which is a key biochemical component of the visual retinoid cycle.  We are currently developing QLT091001 for the treatment of Inherited Retinal Disease caused by RPE65 and LRAT gene mutations ("Inherited Retinal Disease" or "IRD"), which indication includes Leber Congenital Amaurosis ("LCA") and Retinitis Pigmentosa ("RP"). To date, we have completed an initial Phase Ib clinical proof of concept study, a follow-up retreatment study in LCA and RP patients with autosomal recessive mutations in RPE65 or LRAT (the "Retreatment Study"), and a Phase 1b study in 5 RP patients with autosomal dominant mutations in RPE65. We are continuing to advance our pivotal trial start-up activities with the goal of initiating a Phase III pivotal trial in the third quarter of 2016 for the treatment of Inherited Retinal Disease. In addition, we are concurrently exploring with the EMA the submission of a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") in the second half of 2016 for the conditional approval of QLT091001, which would potentially accelerate its commercial availability as a treatment option. Refer to the Item 1 - Business - Our Products in Development for more information.  Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $23.0 million compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $18.9 million increase in net loss was primarily due to the receipt of a $28.4 million termination fee received on October 9, 2014, in connection with our pursuit of a strategic merger with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (see the Terminated Merger Transaction with Auxilium section below), as compared to a lower termination fee of $2.7 million received on September 15, 2015 in connection with our pursuit of a strategic merger with InSite Vision Incorporated (see the Terminated Merger Transaction with InSite section below). The variance between the termination fee received in each respective year was also partially offset by a general decline in operating expenses in 2015. As at December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was  Table of Contents  $534.3 million. We have devoted a significant amount of resources to our research and development activities and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses, milestone payments and operating losses as we advance the clinical development of QLT091001. See the Contractual Obligations section below for more information.  Our operations and strategic activities are currently funded through cash on hand. As at December 31, 2015, we had $141.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, which are invested in highly liquid investments. On February 5, 2016, QLT completed $45.0 million cash investment in Aralez Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Aralez Canada") in exchange for 7,200,000 of Aralez common shares (the "Aralez Shares") at a price of US$6.25 per share. We intend to effect a special election distribution of the Aralez Shares to our shareholders by way of a reorganization of share capital pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement, payable, at the election of each such shareholder, in either Aralez Shares or cash, subject to possible pro-ration (the "Aralez Distribution"). Any cash to be distributed pursuant to the Aralez Distribution will be funded pursuant to the terms of the Backstop Agreement, as amended, described below.  Following the termination of the proposed InSite Merger and Auxilium Merger described below, we are continuing to identify, evaluate and review our strategic and business options in parallel with the ongoing development of our synthetic retinoid, QLT091001. We may incur significant expenses related to the pursuit of these strategic and business options.  Strategic Initiatives  2015  Terminated Merger Transaction with InSite  Following the 2014 termination of the Auxilium Merger Agreement (as described below), in 2015 we continued to review our strategic and business options. Greenhill & Co. LLC ("Greenhill") was engaged as our financial advisor to aid in developing, exploring and providing advice with respect to such strategic and business alternatives. As a result of our review of strategic alternatives in 2015, we entered into the agreements described below.  On June 8, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended and restated on July 16, 2015 and August 26, 2015 (the "InSite Merger Agreement") among QLT, InSite Vision Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("InSite"), and Isotope Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of QLT. Under the terms of the InSite Merger Agreement, InSite would have become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of QLT, and InSite stockholders would have received QLT common shares based on an exchange ratio equal to 0.078 of a QLT common share per share of InSite common stock, subject to a collar mechanism (the "InSite Merger").  On September 15, 2015, the InSite Merger Agreement was terminated after InSite notified QLT that its board of directors had determined, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that a second unsolicited offer (as amended, the "Sun Proposal") from Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. ("Sun") was superior to the proposed InSite Merger with QLT. The Sun Proposal was an all-cash offer to acquire InSite for $0.35 per share of InSite common stock. As a result, InSite notified QLT that it was exercising its right to terminate the InSite Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with Sun, and InSite paid QLT a termination fee of $2.7 million.  In conjunction with the entry into the InSite Merger Agreement, on June 8, 2015 we granted InSite a secured line of credit (the "Secured Note") for up to $9.9 million to fund continuing operations through to the completion of the InSite Merger, subject to certain conditions and restrictions. The Secured Note bore interest at 12% per annum and was secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of InSite's assets. Upon termination of the InSite Merger Agreement, InSite's repayment obligations under the Secured Note were accelerated and InSite paid QLT $5.8 million on September 15, 2015, which consisted of $5.7 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued interest.  Table of Contents  During the year ended December 31, 2015, QLT incurred consulting and transaction fees of $9.4 million in connection with the pursuit of the InSite Merger and the strategic transactions described below. These consulting and advisory fees have been reflected as part of Selling, General and Administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  Following the termination of the InSite Merger Agreement, we are continuing to identify, evaluate and review our strategic and business options in parallel with the ongoing development of our synthetic retinoid, QLT091001.  Aralez Investment and Distribution  On December 7, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Share Subscription Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement") with Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. ("Tribute"), POZEN Inc. ("POZEN"), Aralez Pharmaceuticals plc, (formally known as Aguono Limited) ("Aralez Ireland"), Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("Aralez Canada"), Deerfield Private Design Fund II, L.P., Deerfield International Master Fund, L.P., Deerfield Partners, L.P. (together "Deerfield"), Broadfin Healthcare Master Fund, Ltd. ("Broadfin") and JW Partners, LP, JW Opportunities Fund, LLC and J.W. Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd. (together the "JW Parties") (QLT, Deerfield, Broadfin and the JW Parties are referred to herein collectively as the "Co-Investors"). The Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement amended and restated a share subscription agreement entered into on June 8, 2015 (the "Subscription Agreement") among QLT, Tribute, POZEN, Aralez Ireland, the Co-Investors and certain other investors. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Subscription Agreement, immediately prior to the consummation of the merger transactions contemplated by the merger agreement governing the business combination of Tribute and POZEN (the "Aralez Merger") Tribute agreed to sell to QLT and the other Co-Investors $75.0 million of the common shares of Tribute (the "Tribute Shares") in a private placement at a purchase price per share equal to: (a) the lesser of (i) US$7.20, and (ii) a five percent (5) discount off the five day volume weighted average price ("VWAP") per share of POZEN common stock calculated over the five trading days immediately preceding the date of closing of the Aralez Merger, not to be less than US$6.25 per share; multiplied by (b) the Aralez Merger exchange ratio of  On February 5, 2016, the Aralez Merger was consummated and QLT completed its investment of $45.0 million, receiving 7,200,000 Aralez Shares (representing 10.1% of the issued and outstanding Aralez Shares) at a price of US$6.25 per share. The Aralez Shares are listed on the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchange.  We intend to effect a special election distribution of the Aralez Shares to our shareholders as part of a reorganization of our share capital (the "Share Reorganization") pursuant to a court-approved statutory Plan of Arrangement under Section 288 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the "Plan of Arrangement"), payable, at the election of each shareholder, in either Aralez Shares or cash, subject to possible pro-ration (the "Aralez Distribution").  In connection with the Aralez Distribution, QLT entered into a share purchase agreement (the "Backstop Agreement") on June 8, 2015, as amended on December 7, 2015, among QLT, Broadfin and the JW Parties, under which Broadfin and the JW Parties agreed to purchase up to $15.0 million of the Aralez Shares from the Company at US$6.25 per share so that QLT shareholders will be given the opportunity to elect to receive, in lieu of Aralez Shares, up to an aggregate of US$15.0 million in cash, subject to proration among the shareholders.  As a result, QLT shareholders as of February 16, 2016, the record date for the Aralez Distribution (the "Record Date"), will receive approximately 0.13629 of an Aralez Share for each QLT common share held based on the current number of issued and outstanding QLT common shares, subject to the cash election funded pursuant to the terms of the Backstop Agreement. The final amount of Aralez Shares (or cash in lieu) payable in respect of each QLT share will be based on the number of issued and outstanding QLT shares on the Record Date. In order to elect to receive cash in lieu of all or part of their entitlement to Aralez Shares, QLT shareholders must complete and return an election form which was mailed on February 22, 2016 to registered shareholders on the Record Date. The election form must be returned to QLT's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services Inc., on or before the deadline which will be set out in the election form.  Table of Contents  The Share Reorganization requires the approval of our shareholders which will be sought at a special meeting (the "Special Meeting") of shareholders scheduled to be held on March 18, 2016. If approved at the Special Meeting, the Share Reorganization is expected to permit QLT to make the Aralez Distribution to QLT shareholders in a tax efficient manner. If the Share Reorganization is not approved at the Special Meeting, the Board may implement the Aralez Distribution as a dividend in kind. The Aralez Distribution is anticipated to be completed on or around March 22, 2016. See Item 1. Business - Overview - Strategic Initiatives - 2015 for more information.  Private Placement  On June 8, 2015, QLT entered into a Share Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement (as amended, the "Share Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement") with Broadfin, JW Partners, LP, JW Opportunities Fund, LLC, EcoR1 Capital Fund Qualified, L.P. and EcoR1 Capital Fund, LP (the "QLT Investors"). The Share Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement provides that, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, QLT will, following the completion of the Aralez Distribution, issue and sell to the QLT Investors a certain number of QLT common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million (the "Private Placement"), reflecting a per share purchase price of $1.87. The closing of the share issuance contemplated by the Share Purchase and Registration Rights Agreement is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by such agreement will be consummated.  2014  Terminated Merger Transaction with Auxilium  On June 25, 2014, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Auxilium Merger Agreement") among QLT, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Auxilium"), QLT Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of QLT ("HoldCo"), and QLT Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of HoldCo ("AcquireCo"). The Auxilium Merger Agreement contemplated a business combination, through a stock transaction, whereby AcquireCo would be merged with and into Auxilium; AcquireCo's corporate existence would then subsequently cease; and Auxilium would continue as the surviving corporation (the "Auxilium Merger"). On the date of the closing of the Auxilium Merger, Auxilium would have become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of QLT and Auxilium stockholders would have received common shares representing approximately 76% of the combined company, subject to certain adjustments.  On October 8, 2014, the Auxilium Merger Agreement terminated after Auxilium delivered a notice of termination to QLT informing QLT that Auxilium's board of directors had reviewed an offer from Endo International plc (the "Endo Proposal") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Auxilium and, after consulting with its financial advisors and legal advisors, determined that the Endo Proposal was superior to the proposed merger with QLT. Due to this change in recommendation by Auxilium's board of directors and in accordance with the termination provisions of the Auxilium Merger Agreement, on October 9, 2014, Auxilium paid QLT a termination fee of $28.4 million. On October 22, 2014, pursuant to the terms of our financial advisory services agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ("Credit Suisse"), we paid Credit Suisse a breakup fee of $5.7 million (the "Breakup Fee") in connection with the termination of the Auxilium Merger Agreement. Our financial advisory services agreement with Credit Suisse was subsequently terminated.  During the year ended December 31, 2014, QLT incurred $10.2 million of consulting and transaction fees in connection with our pursuit of the Auxilium Merger. The $10.2 million of consulting and transaction fees, which includes the $5.7 million Breakup Fee, are reflected as part of Selling, General and Administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.  Table of Contents  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Significant estimates are used for, but not limited to, the fair value of contingent consideration, allocation of overhead expenses to research and development, stock-based compensation, and provisions for taxes, uncertain tax positions, tax assets, and tax liabilities. Actual results may differ from estimates made by management. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those which follow:  Contingent Consideration  When contingent consideration assets arise, they are measured at fair value and revalued at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, fair value changes are reported as part of Other (Expense) Income related to continuing operations. Fair value changes in contingent consideration are positively impacted by the passage of time, since all remaining expected cash flows are closer to collection, thereby increasing their present value. Fair value changes in contingent consideration are also impacted by the projected amount and timing of expected future cash flows as well as the cost of capital used to discount these cash flows.  As described under Note 7 - Contingent Consideration of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, we are currently in dispute with Valeant related to a $5.0 million earn-out milestone (the "Laser Earn-Out Payment") which is payable to QLT under the terms of the Valeant Agreement. On December 15, 2015, QLT commenced an action against Valeant for breach of contract related to this matter. As at December 31, 2015, the Laser Earn-Out Payment is recorded in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at its estimated fair value of $2.0 million (2014 - $2.0 million) to reflect the collection risk associated with the Valeant dispute and litigation. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $2.0 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the Laser Earn-Out Payment to account for the potential collection costs, increased uncertainty and assessed collection risk. In 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the Laser Earn-Out Payment was estimated using a probability weighted approach to examine the various possible outcomes with respect to the timing and amount, net of collection costs, that may be collected.  Stock-Based Compensation  Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") topic 718 requires stock-based compensation to be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant, with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide services in exchange for the stock award. Compensation expense recognition provisions are applicable to new awards as well as any awards modified, repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date.  We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of our stock option awards at each grant date. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of such options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. We project expected volatility and the expected life of such options based on historical and other economic data trended into future years. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates that coincide with the terms of our options.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million was expensed as follows: $1.2 million to research and development costs, and $0.9 million to selling, general and administrative costs. The weighted average assumptions used to value the options granted during 2015 included:  For the year ended December 31, 2014, stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million was expensed as follows: $0.8 million to research and development costs and $0.6 million to selling, general and administrative costs. The weighted average assumptions used to value the options granted during 2014 included:  Table of Contents  For the year ended December 31, 2013, stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million was expensed as follows: $0.4 million to research and development costs and $0.2 million to selling, general and administrative costs. The weighted average assumptions used to value the options granted during 2013 included:  Research and Development  Research and development ("R&D") costs are expensed as incurred and consist of direct and indirect expenditures, including a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses to our various R&D programs. Overhead expenses generally consist of costs incurred to provide general and administrative support to the R&D . . .  Feb 25, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

 QLT INC/BC (Form: 424B3, Received: 08/01/2005 15:39:13) 














	Table of Contents





	Filed Pursuant to rule 424(b)(3)

	Registration Number 333-126606




	PROSPECTUS







	1,000,000 Shares




	QLT INC.




	 




	Common Stock




	 



	       
	This prospectus relates to the public offering of
	1,000,000 shares of our common stock by the selling
	shareholders identified on page 12 of this prospectus.


	     
	The warrant exercised by the selling shareholders was originally
	issued to Elan International Services, Ltd. (EIS) and was
	exercisable for 1,000,000 shares of the common stock of
	Atrix Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Atrix). EIS
	transferred the warrant to Elan Pharmaceutical
	Investments III, Ltd., who later transferred the warrant to
	Kings Road Investments Ltd. (Kings Road).


	     
	On November 19, 2004, Atrix became our wholly owned
	subsidiary and, under Section 4(a) of the warrant, the
	warrant became exercisable for 1,000,000 shares of our
	common stock. Kings Road subsequently acquired the shares
	through the exercise of the warrant on January 3, 2005.


	     
	We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of
	common stock by the selling shareholders. The selling
	shareholders will bear all sales commissions and similar
	expenses. All other expenses in connection with this
	registration will be borne by us.


	     
	Our common stock is traded in Canada on the Toronto Stock
	Exchange under the symbol QLT and in the
	U.S. on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol
	QLTI. On July 29, 2005, the last sale price of
	our common stock was (1) $10.46 per share on the
	Toronto Stock Exchange and (2) $8.53 per share on the
	Nasdaq Stock Market.


	     
	This prospectus and the letter of transmittal are being
	delivered to the selling shareholder on or about August 3,
	2005.



	 



	      

	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state
	securities commission has approved or disapproved of these
	securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or
	complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
	offense.




	 



	The date of this prospectus is August 1, 2005.

	QLT INC.



	     

	The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the
	more detailed information, including our consolidated financial
	statements and related notes, included in this prospectus and
	incorporated in this prospectus by reference. Unless the context
	otherwise requires, the terms QLT, we,
	us and our refer to QLT Inc., a British
	Columbia corporation.



	     
	We are a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the
	discovery, development and commercialization of innovative
	therapies in the fields of ophthalmology, dermatology, oncology
	and urology. Our company was formed in 1981 under the laws of
	the Province of British Columbia, Canada.


	     
	Our first commercial product was in the field of photodynamic
	therapy, or PDT, which uses photosensitizers (light activated
	drugs) in the treatment of disease. Our primary commercial
	product, Visudyne®, utilizes PDT to treat the eye disease
	known as wet-form age related macular degeneration, or wet AMD,
	the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 55 in
	North America and Europe.


	     
	In November 2004, we acquired Atrix Laboratories, Inc., or
	Atrix, a Fort Collins, Colorado based biopharmaceutical
	company focused on advanced drug delivery. With our acquisition
	of Atrix (now our wholly owned subsidiary QLT USA, Inc., or QLT
	USA) we have expanded and diversified our portfolio of approved
	products, products in development or under regulatory review,
	and proprietary technologies. In addition to our lead commercial
	product Visudyne, as a result of the Atrix acquisition, we now
	market, through commercial partners, the Eligard® group of
	products for the treatment of prostate cancer, a line of
	dermatology products and a line of dental products.


	     
	Our efforts to increase our portfolio of marketed products are
	ongoing. We recently acquired marketing rights to
	Aczone


	tm


	,
	our topical acne product, following the termination of a
	Collaboration, Licensing and Supply agreement previously entered
	into between QLT USA and Astellas US LLC. We carry out research,
	pre-clinical and clinical projects in fields such as
	ophthalmology, dermatology, oncology and urology. We also
	conduct contract research and development work on product
	candidates of third parties from which we can potentially derive
	royalty and other revenues upon commercialization.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	     
	This prospectus may contain forward-looking statements within
	the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation
	Reform Act of 1995 which are based on our current expectations
	and projections. Words such as anticipate,
	project, expect, forecast,
	outlook, plan, intend,
	estimate, should, may,
	assume, continue, and variations of such
	words or similar expressions are intended to identify our
	forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include,
	but are not limited to, those in which we project or predict
	future results or events.


	     
	We caution that actual outcomes and results may differ
	materially from those expressed in our forward-looking
	statements because such statements are predictions only and they
	are subject to a number of important risk factors and
	uncertainties. Risk factors and uncertainties which could cause
	actual results to differ from what is expressed or implied by
	our forward-looking statements are described in more detail
	under the heading Risk Factors. We encourage you to
	read those descriptions carefully. We caution investors not to
	place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained
	in this prospectus. These statements, like all statements in
	this prospectus, speak only as of the date of this prospectus,
	unless an earlier date is indicated, and, except as required by
	law and the rules and regulations of the SEC and Canadian
	regulatory authorities, we undertake no obligation to update or
	revise the statements.

	RISK FACTORS



	     
	In addition to the other information included in this
	Registration Statement, you should consider carefully the
	following factors, which describe the risks, uncertainties and
	other factors that may materially and adversely affect our
	business, financial condition and operating results. We are
	identifying these as important factors that could cause actual
	events or our actual results to differ materially from those
	contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements
	within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
	Act of 1995 made by us or on our behalf in this Registration
	Statement or elsewhere. We are relying upon the safe harbor for
	forward-looking statements and any such statements are qualified
	by reference to the cautionary statements set out elsewhere in
	this Registration Statement.
















	Our Future Operating Results Are Uncertain and Likely to
	Fluctuate.






	     
	Until the fourth quarter of 2000, we had a history of operating
	losses. Although we were profitable for the years 2000-2003 and
	the first quarter of 2005 (2004 was impacted by a charge of
	$236.0 million for purchase of in-process research and
	development related to the Atrix acquisition  see
	Note 4 to the Financial Statements in our Form 10-K
	dated March 16, 2005), future operating performance and
	profitability are not certain. Our accumulated deficit at
	March 31, 2005 was approximately $158.5 million.


	     
	Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a
	number of reasons. In budgeting our operating expenses, some of
	which are fixed in the short term, we assume that revenues will
	continue to grow. Even a relatively small revenue shortfall or a
	small increase in operating expenses may cause a periods
	results to be below expectations. A revenue shortfall or
	increase in operating expenses could arise from any number of
	factors, such as:














	 


	 


	lower than expected revenues from sales of Visudyne®,
	Eligard® or our other products;




	 




	 


	 


	changes in pricing strategies or reimbursement levels for
	Visudyne, Eligard or our other products;




	 




	 


	 


	seasonal fluctuations, particularly in the third quarter due to
	decreased demand for Visudyne in the summer months;




	 




	 


	 


	high levels of marketing expenses for Visudyne, such as may
	occur upon the launch of Visudyne in a new market;




	 




	 


	 


	fluctuations in currency exchange rates;




	 




	 


	 


	unfavorable outcome of pending patent-related litigation against
	the Company;




	 




	 


	 


	higher than expected operating expenses as a result of increased
	costs associated with the development or commercialization of
	Visudyne, Eligard and our other products and candidates,
	including increased costs associated with the further
	development and marketing of
	Aczone


	tm


	; and




	 




	 


	 


	increased operating expenses as a result of product, technology
	or other acquisitions or business combinations.


















	Future Sales of Visudyne®, Eligard®




	and our other products may be less than expected.






	     
	Our prospects are dependent on the sales of our primary
	commercial product, Visudyne, and to a lesser extent those of
	Eligard and our other products. Our revenues to date have
	consisted largely of revenue from product sales of Visudyne. If
	sales of Visudyne, Eligard or our other products decline or fail
	to increase, it would have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and results of operations.


	     
	A number of factors may affect the rate and breadth of market
	acceptance and continued use of our commercial products,
	including:














	 


	 


	perceptions of physicians and patients regarding the safety and
	efficacy of our products;




	 




	 


	 


	patient and physician demand;




	 




	 


	 


	the results of product development efforts for new indications
	or additional market opportunities for Visudyne, Eligard, and
	our other products;




	 




	 


	 


	availability of sufficient commercial quantities of Visudyne,
	Eligard and our other products;




	 




	 


	 


	price changes for our products, and the price of our products
	relative to other drugs or competing treatments;




	 




	 


	 


	retreatment rates for Visudyne throughout the treatment process
	varying from the retreatment rates during clinical development;




	1







	Table of Contents
















	 


	 


	the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and
	favorable reimbursement programs for Visudyne, Eligard, and our
	other products;




	 




	 


	 


	adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning
	Visudyne, Eligard or our other products;




	 




	 


	 


	a decline in the market for Visudyne, or incidence rates of wet
	AMD, such as might occur if preventative treatments currently in
	development are successful;




	 




	 


	 


	a decline in the markets for Eligard or our other
	products; or




	 




	 


	 


	a decline in reimbursement levels for our products;




	as well as the other factors which are described in this section.
















	We may not be successful in addressing competition for
	Visudyne®, Eligard®




	or our other
	products.






	     
	We may be unable to contend successfully with current or future
	competitors. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are
	characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense
	competition. Our competitors include major pharmaceutical and
	biopharmaceutical companies, many of which have access to
	financial, technical and marketing resources significantly
	greater than ours and substantially greater experience in
	developing and manufacturing products, conducting preclinical
	and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals.


	     
	We are aware of a number of competitors or potential competitors
	to Visudyne.


	     
	Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in partnership with Pfizer Inc.
	commercially launched its product Macugen® in January of
	2005. Macugen has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
	all forms of wet AMD. Macugen now competes with Visudyne. In
	June of 2005 Eyetech Pharmaceuticals announced its forecast of
	net product revenues from the sale of Macugen for 2005 of
	$175-190 million. The impact of sales of Macugen on sales
	of Visudyne is not presently estimable but may be material.


	     
	In May of 2005 Alcon, Inc. announced that it received an
	approvable letter from the FDA, in response to its submission of
	an NDA for its product Retaane®, for the treatment of wet
	AMD. Alcon has also submitted European Marketing Authorization
	Applications for this product. Alcon has recently announced that
	it will be meeting with the FDA to discuss the approvable letter
	and the steps which may be necessary to gain final approval. It
	is possible that final approval could be obtained in time to
	allow Retaane to be competing with Visudyne as early as during
	2005.


	     
	Genentech, Inc., in collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, is
	currently conducting two Phase III studies of its product
	Lucentis, for the treatment of AMD, as well as a Phase I/
	II trial studying Lucentis in combination with Visudyne therapy.
	In May of 2005 Genentech announced preliminary data from its
	MARINA Phase III study evaluating Lucentis in the treatment
	of wet AMD. Genentech has announced that this study met its
	primary endpoint at one year, with vision maintained or improved
	in roughly 95% of patients, compared to 62% in the control arm.
	In late May of 2005 Genentech announced preliminary data from
	its phase I/ II study of Lucentis and Visudyne in
	combination, which showed that 90% of patients maintained or
	improved vision in combination therapy compared to 68% using
	Visudyne alone. Data from the other Phase III trial is
	expected in the fourth quarter of 2005. It is possible that
	Genentech could receive FDA approval for Lucentis for the
	treatment of AMD in time to allow the product to be commercially
	launched and competing with Visudyne as early during 2006.


	     
	We are aware of a number of other competitors developing
	treatments for AMD including Iridex Corporation, Genaera
	Corporation and GenVec, Inc. Some of these treatments are in
	late-stage clinical development. We also believe that Visudyne
	could be competing against surgical or other treatments for AMD,
	including macular translocation, submacular surgery and laser
	photocoagulation, among others. If competing treatments for AMD
	are introduced to the market, Visudynes market share could
	be eroded or retreatment rates reduced. The terms of our
	agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, do not restrict
	Novartis from developing or commercializing, whether by itself
	or in collaboration with third parties, non-PDT products that
	could be competitive with our products that utilize PDT for
	ophthalmological indications, including Visudyne.


	     
	There are a number of approved products on the market with which
	our Eligard products compete. These include AstraZenecas
	Zoladex® product, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporations
	Viadur® product, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s
	Trelstar® product and TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s
	Lupron® product.

	Upon commercialization, our
	Aczone


	tm


	product will directly compete against several other prescription
	topical products for the treatment of acne. These include, but
	are not limited to, erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide,
	clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, and adapalene products.
	Aczone


	tm


	will also compete indirectly with systemic prescription products
	and topical over-the-counter therapies.


	     
	Competitors of our dental products include OraPharma, Inc.,
	whose
	Arestin


	tm


	product is used for the treatment of periodontal disease.


	     
	We believe that certain competitors are conducting preclinical
	studies and clinical testing on their own or with certain third
	parties in various countries for a variety of diseases and
	medical conditions for which we have ongoing development
	programs. These companies may also be involved in competitive
	activities of which we are not aware.


	     
	Each of our approved products faces competition and our products
	under regulatory review and in development will also face
	competition. Our industry is characterized by intense
	competition and new product innovation, which may limit our
	commercial opportunities, render our products obsolete or reduce
	our revenue.


	     
	The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly
	competitive. We face intense competition from academic
	institutions, government agencies, research institutions and
	other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including
	other drug delivery companies. Some of these competitors are
	also our collaborators. Our competitors are working to develop
	and market other drug delivery systems, vaccines, antibody
	therapies and other methods of preventing or reducing disease,
	and new small-molecule and other classes of drugs that can be
	used without a drug delivery system.


	     
	We are aware of other products manufactured or under development
	by competitors that are used for the prevention and treatment of
	certain diseases that we have targeted for product development.
	The existence of these products, or other products or treatments
	of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be
	developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability
	of our products.


	     
	Many of our competitors have much greater capital resources,
	manufacturing and marketing experience, research and development
	resources and production facilities than we do. Many of them
	also have much more experience than we do in preclinical testing
	and clinical trials of new drugs and in obtaining FDA and
	foreign approvals. In addition, they may succeed in obtaining
	patents that would make it difficult or impossible for us to
	compete with their products.


	     
	Because new product innovation can emerge unexpectedly in the
	biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, the development by
	competitors of technologically improved or different products
	may make our products or product candidates obsolete or
	non-competitive.
















	The incidence of wet AMD might be reduced if therapies
	currently in development or currently available prevent or
	reduce the risk of development of wet AMD.






	     
	We are aware of reports that a trial has been or is about to be
	initiated of a treatment for patients with the dry form of AMD
	who are at high risk of developing wet AMD, with the objective
	of preventing the occurrence of wet AMD. We are also aware of
	published reports of studies showing that supplemental vitamin
	therapies reduce the risk of development of wet AMD. If these
	studies show that new therapies are effective or if supplemental
	vitamin usage becomes common place in patients with dry AMD, the
	incidence of wet AMD, which often develops in patients initially
	diagnosed with dry AMD, might be reduced, and Visudyne sales and
	the Companys revenues could be materially reduced.
















	If we are unable to preserve the commercial relationships
	which were formed by Atrix, we may not realize all of the
	anticipated benefits of the acquisition.






	     
	The former Atrix established a number of commercial
	relationships with third parties that are individually or
	collectively important to the success of what is now QLT USA.
	For example, Atrix formed strategic relationships with
	collaborators to help it commercialize and market its products,
	such as its relationship with Sanofi-Aventis for the United
	States and Canadian commercialization and marketing of the
	Eligard products. If our relationship with those collaborators,
	such as MediGene AG (or MediGene), Sandoz Inc. (or Sandoz), or
	Sanofi-Aventis was impaired, it could delay the applicable
	collaboration program or

	result in expensive arbitration or litigation and QLT USAs
	revenue may significantly decrease and our ability to develop
	and commercialize our technologies may be hindered.
















	We are dependent on third parties to market
	Visudyne®




	and Eligard®


	.




	     
	A significant portion of our revenue depends on the efforts of
	Novartis to market and sell Visudyne. If Novartis does not
	dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of
	Visudyne, or if Novartis fails in its marketing efforts, or if
	marketing and distribution expenses are excessive, the revenues
	we receive from the sale of Visudyne would decrease and our
	business and operating results would be adversely affected. The
	agreement between us and Novartis pursuant to which Novartis
	markets and sells Visudyne has a term extending to 2014 and may
	be terminated by Novartis upon a default of the agreement by us
	or on 60 days notice.


	     
	We have formed strategic relationships with a number of other
	collaborators to help us commercialize and market Eligard. Our
	revenues from Eligard and our dermatology and dental products
	are dependent on the efforts of our marketing partners in
	promoting and selling those products. If those partners do not
	dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of our
	products, the revenues we receive from sales of those products
	would decrease and our business and operating results would be
	adversely affected.
















	We are dependent on other third parties for the research,
	development, and commercialization of our products.






	     
	Our strategy for the development and commercialization of our
	products includes entering into various arrangements with third
	parties and therefore is dependent on the subsequent success of
	these third parties in performing their responsibilities under
	such arrangements.


	     
	Although we believe that parties to our collaborative
	arrangements have an economic incentive to succeed in performing
	their contractual responsibilities, the amount and timing of
	resources to be devoted to these activities generally are not
	under our control. We cannot predict whether such parties will
	perform their obligations as expected or whether significant
	revenue will be derived or sustained from such arrangements. To
	the extent such parties do not perform adequately under our
	various agreements with them, the development and
	commercialization of our products may be delayed, may become
	more costly to us or may be terminated, and may require us to
	expend significant amounts of time and money to find new
	collaborators and structure alternative arrangements. Disputes
	with a collaborator could delay a program on which we are
	working with the collaborator and could result in expensive
	arbitration or litigation, which may not be resolved in our
	favor.
















	In the field of photodynamic therapy, or PDT, we are
	dependent on the success and continued supply of third-party
	medical device companies with complementary light source and
	light delivery devices by third party suppliers.






	     
	We currently depend on two third-party suppliers, Carl
	Zeiss-Meditic and Lumenis, to provide the laser light delivery
	devices for Visudyne therapy and to service such devices.
	Because PDT requires a light source, and in some instances a
	light delivery system, to be used in conjunction with our
	photosensitizers, we are dependent on the success of these
	medical device companies in placing and maintaining light
	sources with the appropriate medical facilities, in distributing
	the light delivery systems and servicing such systems as
	required. Carl Zeiss-Meditic and Lumenis supply such lasers to
	treating physicians directly, and neither QLT nor Novartis has a
	supply or distribution agreement with either Carl Zeiss-Meditic
	or Lumenis for the supply of such devices. The relationship
	between our Company and Novartis and such suppliers, under which
	we and Novartis provides support and assistance to such
	suppliers, is an informal collaboration only. If one or both of
	the medical device companies with whom we and Novartis have such
	collaborations cease to carry on business, or if, as a result of
	industry consolidation, financial down-turn or for other
	reasons, they no longer supply complementary light sources or
	light delivery systems or if they are unable to achieve the
	appropriate placements of light sources and ensure an
	uninterrupted supply and ongoing maintenance of light delivery
	systems to treating physicians, sales of Visudyne and our
	revenues from the sale of Visudyne may be adversely affected. We
	may not be able to secure additional or replacement arrangements
	with other satisfactory medical device companies to complement
	or replace the activities of our current providers.


	     
	The expected lifecycle of the laser light delivery devices for
	Visudyne therapy is approximately five to eight years.
	Therefore, in the coming years, we expect that many of these
	lasers will need significant upgrades


	4







	Table of Contents




	or will need to be replaced. Customers may decide not to invest
	in purchasing a new laser in light of emerging competitive
	therapies and this could negatively impact our future sales,
	possibly materially.
















	We may be unable to have manufactured or continue to have
	manufactured efficiently commercial quantities of
	Visudyne®




	or our other products in compliance
	with FDA and other regulatory requirements or our product
	specifications.






	     
	We depend on several third parties in the U.S., Canada, Europe
	and Japan to manufacture Visudyne, and if such third parties
	fail to meet their respective contract commitments, we may not
	be able to supply or continue to supply commercial quantities of
	the product or conduct certain future clinical testing. We are
	dependent upon Raylo Chemicals Inc., Nippon Fine Chemicals and
	Parkedale Pharmaceuticals Inc. to manufacture Visudyne or
	components thereof. The agreement between us and Raylo Chemicals
	is in effect for a term ending January 1, 2008, after which
	it will renew for a further two years unless one party provides
	the other with 24 months advance notice of its intention
	not to renew. Our agreement with Nippon Fine Chemicals is in
	effect for a term ending on January 1, 2007. Our agreement
	with Parkedale Pharmaceuticals Inc. is in effect for a term
	expiring December 31, 2009. Although none of these
	agreements is terminable by the other party for convenience, if
	we were to commit a default under or breach of any of such
	agreements, the other party could terminate such agreement. We
	may be unable to renew such agreements after their expiry on
	terms which are commercially acceptable to us.


	     
	Our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize
	Visudyne and our other products, either directly or in
	conjunction with others, depends, in large part, on our ability
	to have such products manufactured at a competitive cost and in
	accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements as well as
	our product specifications. Our contract manufacturers
	manufacturing and quality procedures may not achieve or maintain
	compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory standards or
	product specifications, and, even if they do, we may be unable
	to produce or continue to produce commercial quantities of
	Visudyne and our other products at an acceptable cost or margin.


	     
	If current manufacturing processes are modified, or the source
	or location of our product supply is changed (voluntarily or
	involuntarily), regulatory authorities will require us to
	demonstrate that the material produced from the modified or new
	process or facility is equivalent to the material used in the
	clinical trials or products previously approved. Any such
	modifications to the manufacturing process or supply may not
	achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable regulatory
	requirements or our product specifications. In many cases, prior
	approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any
	changes can be instituted.


	     
	If our manufacturers produce one or more product batches which
	do not conform to FDA or other regulatory requirements, or our
	product specifications, or if they introduce changes to their
	manufacturing processes, our manufacturing expenses may increase
	materially, our product inventories may be reduced to
	unacceptable levels and/or our ability to meet demand for
	Visudyne may be detrimentally impacted, possibly materially. For
	example, during November 2003 two Visudyne batches did not pass
	quality inspection and product inventories and our results were
	negatively impacted by the associated accounting charge,
	although not materially. (See Managements Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations  Note 6 in Notes to the
	Consolidated Financial Statements in our Form 10-K
	dated March 16, 2005.)
















	We have limited experience in manufacturing products on a
	commercial scale, and if we are unable to produce enough
	Eligard®




	or the other products which we
	manufacture to meet market demands, this could cause a decrease
	in revenue.






	     
	QLT USA completed the expansion of our manufacturing facility in
	the second quarter of 2003. Validation of the plant and
	equipment was completed during the third quarter of 2003.
	Certain areas of the plant were qualified by the FDA in 2004. We
	manufacture Eligard at this facility. Even though we have
	obtained FDA and other regulatory approval to do so, our
	manufacturing processes are subject to further review by other
	regulatory authorities, and continued review by the FDA and
	other regulatory authorities. If we modify our current
	manufacturing processes, the FDA and other regulatory
	authorities will require us to demonstrate that the material
	produced from the modified or new process or facility is
	equivalent to the material used in the clinical trials or
	products previously approved. Any such modifications to the
	manufacturing process or supply may not achieve or maintain
	compliance with the applicable regulatory


	5







	Table of Contents




	requirements or our product specifications. In many cases, prior
	approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any
	changes can be instituted.


	     
	In addition, later discovery of problems with our products or
	manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such
	products or processes, including potential withdrawal of Eligard
	or other products from the market. If regulatory authorities
	determine that we have violated regulations or if they restrict,
	suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us
	from manufacturing or selling Eligard or other products until we
	comply, or indefinitely. In addition, if regulatory authorities
	determine that we have not complied with regulations in the
	research and development of a product candidate, then they may
	not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to
	market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our
	products or product candidates, our business and results of
	operations would be materially and adversely affected.


	     
	There is also a risk that our manufacturing capabilities may not
	be sufficient to meet market demands for Eligard or that we may
	experience a disruption in our manufacturing processes. If we
	produce one more Eligard product batches which do not conform to
	FDA or other regulatory requirements, or our product
	specifications, our manufacturing expenses may increase
	materially, our Eligard product inventories may be reduced to
	unacceptable levels, or we may be unable to meet demand for
	Eligard. If we are unable to meet demand for Eligard for a
	significant period of time our business would be harmed
	materially.
















	We have a dependence on one contract manufacturer involved
	in the production of our Eligard®




	products.






	     
	We currently outsource the sterile filling and
	lyophilization, also known as freeze drying, process
	of our Eligard products to Chesapeake Biological Laboratories,
	Inc., an approved contract manufacturer, and rely on this
	manufacturer for this highly specialized service. Our contract
	with Chesapeake Biological Laboratories is for a period of two
	years commencing January 23, 2004, and automatically renews
	for additional one-year terms unless either party provides
	notice on non-renewal more than 90 days prior to
	termination. If this vendor was to deteriorate or terminate,
	production of our Eligard products may be temporarily
	discontinued for several months. We currently have one other
	contract manufacturer as a back-up source for the sterile
	filling and lyophilization process should there be a disruption
	in our Eligard product supply chain. However, the FDA would need
	to approve the change in the manufacturer of the sterile filling
	and lyophilization process for our Eligard products, which could
	take several months. Additionally, we and our partners have at
	least three months of inventory safety stock of Eligard products
	to meet near term future demands, should a disruption in the
	sterile filling and lyophilization process occur. To help
	address this risk, we have built our own sterile filling and
	lyophilization facility which received FDA approval to
	manufacture commercial product in December 2004.
















	The success of Visudyne®, Eligard®




	and our other products may be limited by governmental and
	other third-party payers.






	     
	The continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payers to
	contain or reduce the costs of health care may negatively affect
	the sale of Visudyne, Eligard and our other products. Our
	ability to commercialize Visudyne and our other products
	successfully will depend in part on the timeliness of and the
	extent to which adequate reimbursement for the cost of such
	products and related treatments is obtained from government
	health administration authorities, private health insurers and
	other organizations in the U.S. and foreign markets. Product
	sales, attempts to gain market share or introductory pricing
	programs of our competitors could require us to lower our
	prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
	We may be unable to set or maintain price levels sufficient to
	realize an appropriate return on our investment in product
	development. Significant uncertainty exists as to the
	reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic products or
	newly approved product indications.


	     
	Third-party payers are challenging the price and
	cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and the
	adoption of new legislation and regulations affecting the
	pricing of pharmaceuticals could further limit reimbursement for
	medical products and services. To the extent such governmental
	or private third-party payers introduce reimbursement changes
	which affect Visudyne or our current or future product
	candidates, sales of such products could be negatively affected.
	For example, the U.S. Congress recently introduced
	legislation that has changed the methodologies under which the
	Medicare program reimburses for office-administered therapies
	such as Visudyne. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
	and Modernization Act of 2003 reduced the rate of reimbursement
	for Visudyne and certain other drugs by allowing


	6







	Table of Contents




	reimbursement based on 85% of the average wholesale price, down
	from 95%. We obtained an exemption from this rate adjustment for
	2004 only.


	     
	There can be no assurance that any of our applications or
	re-applications for reimbursement for any of our products will
	result in approvals or that our current reimbursement approvals
	will not be reduced or reversed in whole or in part.
















	Our product sales are worldwide, and currency fluctuations
	may impair our reported financial results.






	     
	Our products are marketed worldwide. For the three months ended
	March 31, 2005, approximately 41% of total Visudyne sales
	were in the U.S., with Europe and other markets responsible for
	the remaining 59%. We expect that international revenues will
	continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues
	for the foreseeable future. A significant portion of our
	business is conducted in currencies other than the
	U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency. The Canadian
	dollar is our functional currency and the U.S. dollar is
	the functional currency of our subsidiary, QLT USA. We recognize
	foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in
	the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between
	the currencies in which we do business, particularly the
	U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swiss
	franc, have caused and could continue to cause significant
	foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We cannot predict
	the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future
	operating results because of the number of currencies involved,
	the variability of currency exposures and the potential
	volatility of currency exchange rates. We engage from time to
	time in currency hedging techniques to mitigate the impact of
	currency fluctuations on our financial results and cash flows,
	but we cannot be assured that our strategies will adequately
	protect our operating results or balance sheet from the full
	effects of exchange rate fluctuation.
















	We do not yet have a commercial infrastructure to market
	or sell pharmaceutical products and have limited experience
	directly selling products, which may adversely affect our
	ability to commercialize
	Aczone

	TM



	.




	     
	QLT has not previously sold or marketed pharmaceutical products
	and does not currently have a sales force or any agreement with
	any provider of contract sales forces to market our products. We
	now hold worldwide commercialization rights to Aczone. Aczone
	was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne
	vulgaris. The FDA approved label for Aczone requires that
	patients be pre-screened for a specific enzyme deficiency.
	Patients who have this enzyme deficiency will need to be
	monitored with regular blood counts. QLT has also agreed with
	the FDA to undertake a post-approval Phase IV study
	pertaining to this enzyme deficiency. That label restriction and
	the results of the Phase IV study, if and when completed,
	may limit the market potential for Aczone. We are presently
	considering our strategy as to how we wish to commercialize and
	further develop Aczone. If we decide to market Aczone ourselves,
	we will need to either hire a sales force or contract with a
	third party to provide a sales force to meet our needs. If we
	decide to market Aczone with or through a marketing partner, we
	will need to reach an agreement with that partner with respect
	to the commercialization of Aczone. We may be unable to
	establish marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or
	relationships necessary to commercialize and gain market
	acceptance for Aczone. Any of the above occurrences could harm
	or prevent sales of Aczone or could increase the costs and
	expenses of commercializing and marketing this product.
















	Our products in development may not achieve favorable
	results, may fail to achieve regulatory approvals or market
	acceptance, or may encounter difficulties with proprietary
	rights or manufacturing.






	     
	Our success depends on our ability to successfully develop and
	obtain regulatory approval to market new pharmaceutical
	products. Development of a product requires substantial
	technical, financial and human resources even if such product
	development is not successfully completed. The outcome of the
	lengthy and complex process of new product development is
	inherently uncertain.


	     
	Our potential products may appear to be promising at various
	stages of development yet fail to reach the market for a number
	of reasons, including:














	 


	 


	lack of sufficient treatment benefit or unacceptable safety
	issues during preclinical studies or clinical trials;




	 




	 


	 


	lack of commercial market opportunity;




	7







	Table of Contents
















	 


	 


	results from preclinical and early clinical studies not
	predictive of results obtained in large-scale clinical trials;




	 




	 


	 


	unfavorable data during a clinical trial causing us to determine
	that continuation of the trial is not warranted. For example, in
	May 2003, we halted our two Phase III studies of tariquidar
	in non-small cell lung cancer after a review of safety and
	efficacy data by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring
	Committee;




	 




	 


	 


	the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspending our clinical
	trials at any time if, among other reasons, it concludes that
	patients participating in such trials are being exposed to
	unacceptable health risks;




	 




	 


	 


	failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals after
	completion of clinical trials;




	 




	 


	 


	existence of conflicting proprietary rights of third parties;




	 




	 


	 


	inability to develop manufacturing methods that are efficient,
	cost-effective and capable of meeting stringent regulatory
	standards; and




	 




	 


	 


	other business imperatives causing us to curtail a particular
	development program.




	     
	We might fail to obtain the additional regulatory approvals we
	are seeking to expand our product line and the indications for
	which our products are approved. Those approvals may be delayed,
	may not be obtained or may be more limited than anticipated. We
	may lose market opportunities resulting from delays and
	uncertainties in the regulatory approval process.
















	If we do not achieve our projected development goals in
	the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of
	our products may be delayed and, as a result, our business could
	be harmed.






	     
	From time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment
	of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product
	development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones.
	These milestones may include the commencement or completion of
	scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of
	regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the
	expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these
	milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual
	timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our
	estimates, or they might not be achieved, in some cases for
	reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones
	as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may
	be delayed and, as a result, our business could be harmed.
	Factors which could cause us to fail to achieve milestones in
	accordance with our projections include:














	 


	 


	study results may vary from what had been predicted;




	 




	 


	 


	studies may take longer to enroll or conclude than projected;




	 




	 


	 


	unfavorable data during a clinical trial might cause us to
	determine that continuation of the trial is not warranted;




	 




	 


	 


	the FDA or other regulatory authorities might suspend our
	clinical trials at any time if, for example, it concludes that
	patients participating in such trials are being exposed to
	unacceptable health risks;




	 




	 


	 


	failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals after
	completion of clinical trials in a timely manner or at
	all; and




	 




	 


	 


	other business imperatives might cause us to delay or
	discontinue certain development activities.


















	Patient enrollment may not be adequate for our current
	trials or future clinical trials.






	     
	Our future prospects could suffer if we fail to develop and
	maintain sufficient levels of patient enrollment in our current
	or future clinical trials. Our willingness and ability to
	complete clinical trials is dependent on, among other factors,
	the rate of patient enrollment, which is a function of many
	factors, including:














	 


	 


	the nature of our clinical trial protocols or products;




	 




	 


	 


	the inability to secure regulatory approval to modify previously
	approved clinical trial protocols;




	 




	 


	 


	the existence of competing protocols;




	 




	 


	 


	the size and longevity of the target patient population;




	 




	 


	 


	the proximity of patients to clinical sites;




	 




	 


	 


	the eligibility criteria for the trials; and




	8







	Table of Contents
















	 


	 


	the patient dropout rates for the trials.




	     
	Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased
	costs, delays or termination of clinical trials, which could
	materially harm our future prospects.
















	Visudyne®, Eligard®, or our other products may
	exhibit adverse side effects that prevent their widespread
	adoption or that necessitate withdrawal from the market.






	     
	Even after approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities,
	Visudyne, Eligard, or our other products may later exhibit
	adverse side effects that prevent widespread use or necessitate
	withdrawal from the market. Undesirable side effects not
	previously observed during clinical trials could emerge in the
	future. The manifestation of such side effects could cause our
	business to suffer. In some cases, regulatory authorities may
	require labeling changes that could add warnings or restrict
	usage based on adverse side effects seen after marketing a drug.
















	We may face future product liability claims that may
	result from the sale of Visudyne®, Eligard®




	and our other products.






	     
	The testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of human
	pharmaceutical products entail significant inherent risks of
	allegations of product liability. Our use of such products in
	clinical trials and our sale of Visudyne, Eligard and our other
	product candidates may expose us to liability claims allegedly
	resulting from the use of these products. These claims might be
	made directly by consumers, healthcare providers or others
	selling our products. We carry clinical trials and product
	liability insurance to cover certain claims that could arise
	during the clinical trials for our product candidates or during
	the commercial use of Visudyne, Eligard or our other products.
	Such coverage, and any coverage obtained in the future, may be
	inadequate to protect us in the event of a successful product
	liability claim, and we may not be able to increase the amount
	of such insurance or even renew it. A successful product
	liability claim could materially harm our business. In addition,
	substantial, complex or extended litigation could cause us to
	incur large expenditures and distract our management.
















	We may be unable to comply with ongoing regulatory
	requirements.






	     
	Our commercial products and our products under development are
	subject to extensive and rigorous regulation for safety,
	efficacy and quality by the U.S. federal government,
	principally the FDA, and by state and local governments. To the
	extent Visudyne, Eligard, our other commercial products or
	products under development are marketed abroad; they are also
	subject to export requirements and to regulation by foreign
	governments. The regulatory clearance process is lengthy,
	expensive and uncertain. We may not be able to obtain, or
	continue to obtain, necessary regulatory clearances or approvals
	on a timely basis, or at all, for any of our commercial products
	or any of our products under development, and delays in receipt
	or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of
	previously received clearances or approvals, or failure to
	comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could
	materially harm our business.


	     
	Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to the FDAs
	approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by
	the FDA, certain state agencies and various foreign governmental
	regulatory agencies such as the EMEA Manufacturers are subject
	to inspection by the FDA and those state agencies, and they must
	comply with the host of regulatory requirements that usually
	apply to drugs marketed in the U.S., including but not limited
	to the FDAs labeling regulations, Good Manufacturing
	Practice requirements, adverse event reporting and the
	FDAs general prohibitions against promoting products for
	unapproved or off-label uses. Our failure to comply
	with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being
	imposed on us. These sanctions could include warning letters,
	fines, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, refusals to
	permit products to be imported into or exported out of the U.S.,
	FDA refusal to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter
	into governmental supply contracts, withdrawals of previously
	approved marketing applications and criminal prosecutions.


	     
	We, our contract manufacturers, all of our subsuppliers, as well
	as the suppliers of the medical lasers required for Visudyne and
	other PDT therapy, are subject to numerous federal, state and
	local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions,
	manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard
	control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous
	substances. In addition, advertising and promotional materials
	relating to medical devices and drugs are, in certain instances,
	subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission or the
	FDA. We, our contract manufacturers, subsuppliers and laser
	suppliers may


	9







	Table of Contents




	be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws
	and regulations in the future, and such laws or regulations may
	materially harm our business. Unanticipated changes in existing
	regulatory requirements, the failure of us, our any of these
	manufacturers, subsuppliers or suppliers to comply with such
	requirements or the adoption of new requirements could
	materially harm our business.
















	Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in
	identifying, negotiating or integrating future acquisitions,
	business combinations or strategic alliances.






	     
	From time to time, we may engage in negotiations to expand our
	operations and market presence by future product, technology or
	other acquisitions and business combinations, joint ventures or
	other strategic alliances with other companies. We may not be
	successful in identifying, initiating or completing such
	negotiations. Competition for attractive product acquisition or
	alliance targets can be intense, and there can be no guarantee
	that we will succeed in completing such transactions on terms
	which are acceptable to us. Even if we are successful in these
	negotiations, these transactions create risks, such as the
	difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an
	acquired business; the potential disruption to our ongoing
	business, and the potential negative impact on our earnings. We
	may not succeed in addressing these risks. If we are not
	successful, our business could suffer.
















	We are a defendant in pending intellectual property and
	patent lawsuits that may require us to pay substantial royalties
	or damages, may subject us to other equitable relief or may
	otherwise seriously harm our business.






	     
	We are a defendant in four lawsuits filed against us (see
	Item 3. Legal Proceedings in our Form 10-K
	dated March 16, 2005 and Item 1. Legal
	Proceedings in our Form 10-Q dated May 10,
	2005). Although we believe that the claims of the plaintiffs in
	these lawsuits are without merit, these lawsuits may not
	ultimately be resolved in our favor. If they are not resolved in
	our favor, we may be obligated to pay damages, may be obligated
	to pay an additional royalty or damages for access to the
	inventions covered by claims in issued U.S. patents, may be
	subject to such equitable relief as a court may determine (which
	could include an injunction) or may be subject to a remedy
	combining some or all of the foregoing.
















	We may not be able to obtain and enforce effective patents
	to protect our proprietary rights from use by competitors, and
	patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay
	to use required technology.






	     
	We may not be able to obtain and enforce patents, to maintain
	trade secret protection for our technology and to operate
	without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties.
	The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm
	our business.


	     
	We have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for
	certain aspects of Visudyne and our other products and
	technology. Such applications may not result in the issuance of
	any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued may
	not provide us with a preferred position with respect to any
	product or technology. It is possible that patents issued or
	licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In that event, to
	the extent a preferred position is conferred by such patents,
	any preferred position held by us would be lost. If we are
	unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred
	position, Visudyne and our other products could become subject
	to competition from the sale of generic products. In addition,
	we have an exclusive worldwide license from the University of
	British Columbia, or UBC, (see Patents, Trademarks and
	Proprietary Rights in our Form 10-K dated
	March 16, 2005) for all of the patents and know-how owned
	by UBC relating to verteporfin, QLT0074 and certain additional
	photosensitizers and their use as therapeutics or diagnostics.
	Under our license agreement with UBC, if we fail to make any
	required payments to UBC, UBC would have the right to terminate
	these licenses. Under our license agreement with Massachusetts
	General Hospital, or MGH (see Patents, Trademarks and
	Proprietary Rights in our Form 10-K dated
	March 16, 2005), MGH would have the right to terminate the
	license if we defaulted under the agreement and failed to cure
	such default within 60 days.


	     
	Patents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the
	products or processes of other parties. The cost of enforcing
	our patent rights against infringers, if such enforcement is
	required, could be significant, and the time demands could
	interfere with our normal operations.


	     
	It is also possible that a court may find us to be infringing
	validly issued patents of third parties. In that event, in
	addition to the cost of defending the underlying suit for
	infringement, we may have to pay license fees


	10







	Table of Contents




	and/or damages and may be enjoined from conducting certain
	activities. Obtaining licenses under third-party patents can be
	costly, and such licenses may not be available at all. Under
	such circumstances, we may need to materially alter our products
	or processes.


	     
	Unpatented trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how
	and continuing technological innovation are important to our
	scientific and commercial success. Although we attempt to and
	will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information
	through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of
	confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners,
	collaborators, employees and consultants and other appropriate
	means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of
	our proprietary information, and, in any event, others may
	develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar
	information.
















	We may need additional capital in the future, and our
	prospects for obtaining it are uncertain.






	     
	Our business may not generate the cash necessary to fund our
	operations and anticipated growth. We expect that the funding
	requirements for our operating activities will continue to
	increase substantially in the future, primarily due to the
	expanded clinical testing of our other products. The amount
	required to fund additional operating expenses will also depend
	on other factors, including the status of competitive products,
	the success of our research and development programs, the extent
	and success of any collaborative research arrangements and the
	results of product, technology or other acquisitions or business
	combinations. We could seek additional funds in the future from
	a combination of sources, including product licensing, joint
	development and other financing arrangements. In addition, we
	may issue debt or equity securities if we determine that
	additional cash resources could be obtained under favorable
	conditions or if future development funding requirements cannot
	be satisfied with available cash resources. Additional capital
	may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If
	adequate capital is unavailable, we may not be able to engage in
	desirable acquisition or in-licensing opportunities and may have
	to reduce substantially or eliminate expenditures for research,
	development, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing for
	Visudyne and our other products. In March 2005, QLT announced
	the establishment of a share buyback program having certain
	parameters. As of July 14, 2005, QLT has purchased
	approximately 1.355 million of our common shares under the
	share buyback program on the open market. The price paid by QLT
	for the repurchase of its shares varied according to the market
	price at the time of purchase.
















	We are subject to environmental compliance risks.






	     
	Our research, development and manufacturing areas involve the
	controlled use of hazardous chemicals, primarily flammable
	solvents, corrosives, and toxins. The biologic materials include
	microbiological cultures, animal tissue and serum samples. Some
	experimental and clinical materials include human source tissue
	or fluid samples. We are subject to federal, state/provincial
	and local government regulation in the conduct of business,
	including regulations on employee safety and handling and
	disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials. Any new
	regulation or change to an existing regulation could require it
	to implement costly capital or operating improvements for which
	we have not budgeted. If we do not comply with these
	regulations, we may be subject to fines and other liabilities.
















	Various provisions of our charter and our shareholder
	rights plan may have the effect of impeding a change in control,
	making removal of the present management more difficult or
	resulting in restrictions on the payment of dividends and other
	distributions to the shareholders.






	     
	With shareholder approval, we have adopted a shareholder rights
	plan that will be in effect for six years commencing
	March 17, 2002. The general effect of the plan is to
	require anyone who seeks to acquire 20% or more of our
	outstanding common shares to make a bid complying with specific
	provisions included in the plan. In certain circumstances,
	holders of common shares may acquire additional shares of QLT
	(or those of the acquirer) at a 50% discount from the
	then-prevailing market price. The provisions of the plan could
	prevent or delay the acquisition of our company by means of a
	tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, making it more
	difficult for shareholders to receive any premium over the
	current market price that might be offered.


	     
	Our authorized preference share capital is available for
	issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of
	directors, without shareholder approval. Our charter grants the
	board of directors the authority, subject to the corporate laws
	of British Columbia, to determine or alter the rights,
	preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed
	on any wholly unissued series of preference shares, including
	any dividend rate, voting rights, conversion privileges or
	redemption or liquidation rights. The rights of any future
	series of


	11







	Table of Contents




	preference shares could have an adverse effect on the holders of
	our common shares by delaying or preventing a change of control,
	making removal of the present management more difficult or
	resulting in restrictions on the payment of dividends and other
	distributions to the holders of common shares.
















	The market price of our common shares is extremely
	volatile.






	     
	The stock prices of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical
	companies, including QLT, are extremely volatile, and it is
	likely that the market price of our common shares will continue
	to be highly volatile. Thus far during 2005, the closing market
	price of our common shares on NASDAQ has ranged from a high of
	$17.15 in January to a low of $8.53 in July. Our stock price
	could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of
	factors, including:

	sales, significant acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	     
	We are registering all 1,000,000 shares on behalf of the
	selling shareholders. The selling shareholders, as
	used herein, includes any of their pledgees, assignees,
	transferees and successors-in-interest. The selling shareholders
	may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of
	common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other stock
	exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are
	traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed
	or negotiated prices. The selling shareholders will act
	independently from us in making decisions with respect to the
	timing, manner and size of each sale. We cannot guarantee that
	the selling shareholders will sell any or all of these shares.
	The selling shareholders may use any one or more of the
	following methods when selling shares:














	 


	 


	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the
	broker-dealer solicits purchasers;




	 




	 


	 


	block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the
	shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the
	block as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	 




	 


	 


	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the
	broker-dealer for its account;




	 




	 


	 


	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the
	applicable exchange;




	 




	 


	 


	privately negotiated transactions;




	 




	 


	 


	short sales;




	 




	 


	 


	an agreement between one or more of the selling shareholders and
	one or more broker-dealers to sell a specified number of such
	shares at a stipulated price per share;




	 




	 


	 


	a combination of any such methods of sale; and




	 




	 


	 


	any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.




	     
	In connection with sales of such shares or otherwise, the
	selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions in the
	course of which broker-dealers may engage in short sales, short
	sales against the box, puts and calls and other transactions in
	our securities or derivatives of our securities with
	broker-dealers. The selling shareholders also may sell our
	common stock short and deliver the shares to close out such
	short positions. The selling shareholders may enter into option
	or other transactions with broker-dealers that require the
	delivery to the broker-dealer of the shares. The broker-dealer
	may then resell or otherwise transfer the shares under this
	prospectus, as supplemented or amended, to reflect such
	transaction. The selling shareholders also may loan or pledge
	the shares to a broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof, who may
	sell the loaned shares or, in an event of default in the case of
	a pledge, sell the pledged shares pursuant to this prospectus.


	     
	The selling shareholders may from time to time pledge or grant a
	security interest in some or all of the shares owned by them
	and, if they default in the performance of their secured
	obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell
	the shares from time to time under this prospectus, or under an
	amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other
	applicable provision of the Securities Act amending the list of
	selling shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other
	successors-in-interest as selling shareholders under this
	prospectus. The selling shareholders may also transfer the
	shares in other circumstances, in which case the transferees,
	pledgees or other successors-in-interest will be the selling
	beneficial owners for purposes of this prospectus.


	     
	Broker-dealers engaged by the selling shareholders may arrange
	for other broker-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers
	may receive commissions or discounts from the selling
	shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as an agent for the
	purchaser of the shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be
	negotiated. The selling shareholders do not expect these
	commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the
	types of transactions involved. The selling shareholders may
	agree to indemnify any agent, broker or dealer that participates
	in transactions involving the shares against certain
	liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities
	Act.


	     
	At the time a particular offer of shares is made, a prospectus
	supplement, if required, will be delivered. Such prospectus
	supplement will set forth the number of shares being offered and
	the terms of the offering, including the name of any
	underwriter, dealer or agent, the purchase price paid by any
	underwriter, any


	13







	Table of Contents




	discount, commission and other items constituting compensation,
	any discount, commission or concession allowed or reallowed or
	paid to any dealer and the proposed sales price to the public.


	     
	The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that
	are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be
	underwriters within the meaning of the Securities
	Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any
	commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any
	profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be
	deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the
	Securities Act.


	     
	We are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the
	registration of the shares.


	     
	The selling shareholders may also sell shares under
	Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather
	than under this prospectus.


	     
	The selling shareholders and other persons participating in the
	sale or distribution of the shares will be subject to the
	provisions of the Exchange Act and its associated rules and
	regulations. Regulation M of the Exchange Act may limit the
	timing of purchases and sales of the shares by the selling
	shareholders and any other person. In addition,
	Regulation M may restrict the ability of any person engaged
	in the distribution of the shares to engage in market-making
	activities for a period of up to five business days before the
	distribution.

	the year ended December 31, 2004, giving effect to the
	acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2004 and
	reflecting only pro forma adjustments expected to have a
	continuing impact on the combined results. As Atrix was
	consolidated with QLT at December 31, 2004, no unaudited
	pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet has been prepared.


	     
	The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
	operations is for informational purposes only. It does not
	purport to indicate the results that would have actually been
	obtained had the acquisition been completed on the assumed date
	or for the period presented, or which may be realized in the
	future. The pro forma financial information does not reflect any
	potential operating efficiencies. The unaudited pro forma

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA




	CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS














	(1)




	Description of Transaction





	     
	On June 14, 2004, QLT entered into an Agreement and Plan of
	Merger by and among QLT, Aspen Acquisition Corp. and Atrix (the
	Merger Agreement) under which QLT acquired Atrix in
	a transaction accounted for as a purchase under accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
	Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and
	liabilities of Atrix were recorded as of the acquisition date,
	at their fair values and added to those of QLT. The reported
	financial condition and results of operations of QLT after
	completion of the acquisition reflected these values. Under the
	terms of the merger agreement, each share of Atrix common stock
	outstanding at the closing of the merger was exchanged for 1.0
	QLT common share, and $14.61 in cash. In addition, each option
	to purchase Atrix common stock that was outstanding on the
	closing date was assumed by QLT and therefore constituted an
	option to acquire QLT common shares. Each of these options is
	subject to the same terms and conditions that were in effect for
	the related Atrix options, except that, in general, options held
	by Atrix employees, consultants or board members immediately
	before the merger became vested at the time of the merger, and
	certain nonqualified stock options were amended immediately
	following the merger so that if the holder is terminated within
	twelve months after the merger, they are exercisable for a year
	(or, if earlier, until expiration of the options). The
	acquisition closed on November 19, 2004.













	(2)




	Purchase Price





	     
	The aggregate consideration for the acquisition of Atrix was
	$870.5 million, which included $325.6 million in cash,
	acquisition related expenditures of $15.0 million, and the
	issuance of 22.3 million common shares of QLT Inc. In
	connection with the acquisition, we also assumed all of the
	outstanding options and warrants to purchase Atrix common shares
	and exchanged them for options to purchase our common shares.
	The total consideration paid for Atrix, including acquisition
	costs, was allocated based on managements preliminary
	assessment as to the estimated fair values on the acquisition
	date. This preliminary assessment is subject to change upon the
	final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and
	liabilities assumed.













	(3)




	Pro Forma Adjustments





	     
	(a) To adjust revenue based on the fair value of
	Atrixs deferred revenue at time of merger.


	     
	(b) To increase cost of sales to reflect full year impact
	of the inventory step-up to fair value upon merger.


	     
	(c) To eliminate non-recurring merger related compensation
	expenses related to terminated employees and accelerated vesting
	of stock options recorded by Atrix.


	     
	(d) Certain Atrix amounts have been reclassified to conform
	with QLTs presentation.


	     
	(e) To eliminate the non-recurring legal and financial
	expenses associated with the merger transaction which have been
	expensed by Atrix.


	     
	(f) To eliminate amounts related to the capitalization of
	Atrixs pre-merger patent maintenance costs from capital in
	order to conform Atrixs accounting policy to QLTs
	accounting policy where patent filing costs are expensed as
	incurred.


	     
	(g) To increase depreciation expense as a result of
	stepping up Atrixs property, plant and equipment to fair
	value upon the merger.


	     
	(h) To record full year of amortization of acquired
	intangibles.


	     
	(i) To write-off the fair value of in-process research and
	development acquired in the merger. This is eliminated because
	this expense is directly attributable to the acquisition and
	will not have a continuing impact.


	     
	(j) To eliminate the interest income on $326 million
	cash paid for the purchase of Atrix, assuming an interest rate
	of 2.5% for the period from January 1, 2004 to
	November 19, 2004.


	     
	(k) To reflect the tax effect of the pro format adjustments
	(b), (g), (h) and (j) using applicable effective tax
	rates of 35% to 38%.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA




	CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS  (Continued)



	     
	(l) To eliminate the accretion of dividends, beneficial
	conversion feature charge and allocation of undistributed
	earnings on preferred stock due to the assumed conversion of the
	preferred stock to common stock immediately prior to the
	effective time of the acquisition.


	     
	(m) Pro forma basic and diluted net (loss) income per
	common shares for the year ended December 31, 2004 are
	based upon the weighted average number of QLT common shares
	outstanding on December 31, 2004, adjusted to provide
	weight for the pre-merger period, from January 1 to
	November 18, 2004, to the 22.3 million common shares
	issued in relation to the Atrix acquisition. The dilutive impact
	of a warrant to purchase 1.0 million QLT common shares
	and Atrix stock options of 6.1 million common shares
	assumed as part of the Atrix acquisition is included in diluted
	net (loss) income per common share under the treasury stock
	method.
