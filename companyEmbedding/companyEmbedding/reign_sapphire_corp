Reign Sapphire's Coordinates Collection to Launch in Europe and UK 

Local partner and brand's original founder underwrites marketing and ad costs



BEVERLY HILLS, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 19, 2017) -  Reign Sapphire Corp. (OTCQB: RGNP) ("Reign" or the "Company"), a direct-to-consumer, branded and custom jewelry company, today announced its latest international partnership to market, sell and distribute its products in Europe and the United Kingdom.
Following the success of its local partnerships in United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the Company has teamed with the original founder of its brand Coordinates Collection, Owen de Vries to run the new effort.
According to ReportLinker and McKinsey & Co., "Sales of jewellery are going up. Annual global sales... expected to grow at a healthy 4 to 6 percent every year, reaching EUR 250 billion by 2020." 
According to Euromonitor, in the Netherlands, jewelry registered a sustained increase in 2017 driven mainly by higher levels of Dutch consumer spending.
The Company intends to replicate the success achieved in the Middle East where its flagship store in the Dubai Mall and regionalised direct-to-consumer website contributes almost 10% of the Company's annual revenue.
The Netherlands based operation will proliferate Reign points of sale (POS) adapted for local language, digital marketing and customer service.
"Europe and United Kingdom is our largest international revenue contributor after the Middle East," commented Reign CEO Joseph Segelman. "Our experience has shown localised marketing, promotion and social media drives direct-to-consumer sales and can assist the company reaching its growth targets."
The company is actively pursuing similar distribution partnerships in the Asia Pacific region. 
About Reign Sapphire Corporation:
Reign Sapphire (OTCQB: RGNP) is a Beverly Hills-based, Direct-to-Consumer (D2C), branded and custom jewelry company with three niche brands: Reign Sapphires: ethically produced, millennial targeted sapphire jewelry, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life's special moments, and Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry. http://www.reignsc.com.

In addition, it is focused on featuring Australian sapphires in its initial jewelry collections.The vertical integration process includes processing bulk quantities of rough Australian sapphires, sizing and sorting the rough (uncut) parcels of sapphires and overseeing the cutting and polishing of the rough stones in contract cutting factories in Asia. This is followed by an in-house design process and outsourced manufacturing process in the United States. The inaugural collections it is focused on offering are Reign Day-to-Night, featuring classic and timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet, featuring bold designs, made for the stars. The Company is focused on targeting its marketing initiatives on Business-to-Consumer (B2C); Business-to-Business (B2B) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners, such as fashion retailers, and building a retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level.

Local Partner and Brand's Original Founder Underwrites Marketing and Ad Costs 

BEVERLY HILLS, CA / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2017 / Reign Sapphire Corp., (OTCQB: RGNP) ("Reign" or the "Company"), a direct-to-consumer, branded and custom jewelry company today announced its latest international partnership to market, sell and distribute its products in Europe and the United Kingdom.
Following the success of its local partnerships in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the Company has teamed with the original founder of its brand Coordinates Collection, Owen de Vries to run the new effort.
According to ReportLinker and McKinsey & Co., "Sales of jewelry are going up. Annual global sales... expected to grow at a healthy 4 to 6 percent every year, reaching ?250 billion by 2020."
According to Euromonitor, in the Netherlands, jewelry registered a sustained increase in 2017 driven mainly by higher levels of Dutch consumer spending.
The Company intends to replicate the success achieved in the Middle East where its flagship store in the Dubai Mall and regionalised website contributes almost 10% of the Company's annual revenue.
The Netherlands based operation will proliferate Reign points of sale (POS) adapted for local language, digital marketing, and customer service.
"Europe and United Kingdom is our largest international revenue contributor after the Middle East," commented Reign CEO Joseph Segelman. "Our experience has shown localized marketing, promotion and social media drives sales and can assist the company reaching its growth targets."
The company is actively pursuing similar distribution partnerships in the Asia Pacific region.
About Reign Sapphire Corporation:
Reign Sapphire (OTCQB: RGNP) is a Beverly Hills-based, D2C branded and custom jewelry company with three niche brands: Reign Sapphires: ethically produced, millennial targeted sapphire jewelry, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life's special moments, and Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry. http://www.reignsc.com.
