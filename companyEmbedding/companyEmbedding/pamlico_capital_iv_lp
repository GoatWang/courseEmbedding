Executive Network | Pamlico Capital
































Executive Network
Our partnerships with talented, industry-focused executives have formed the core of our success over time.





A Critical Component of Our Success
Over our history, our investment professionals have developed an extensive network of talented, industry-focused executives with whom we work in a number of different    capacities. This network has proven to be a critical component of our success and a significant competitive advantage as we look to deliver value to existing and future portfolio companies. We are constantly looking to identify and partner with influential industry executives, experienced managers, and emerging entrepreneurs within our target sectors. 


Flexible Approach to Executive Partnerships 
We offer a variety of ways for talented managers and industry executives to partner with our team, ranging from consulting/advisory arrangements to a more formalized manager-led Search Company structure. We are flexible and creative in designing ways to collaborate with motivated executives, and we recognize that there is no single one-size-fits-all solution to executive partnerships. Whatever the form of the relationship, we can offer the opportunity for proven executives to be rewarded for helping us build great businesses and drive equity value.





The following are some of the ways we often work with executives

Executive Network
We maintain an extensive network of executives, some of whom have worked with us multiple times, but many of whom are new relationships formed over a mutual interest in a certain    sector, theme or business. Whether helping us with diligence prior to investment or post-investment value creation, these relationships are often crucial to our  investment strategy. These individuals often become ongoing advisors/consultants, portfolio     company executive managers, and/or Board Members and typically share in the value creation they help support at each business. Additionally, Pamlico maintains an Advisory Board of experienced executives who help us identify, advise on, and execute value creation initiatives for our portfolio companies across our areas of focus. We continually seek talented managers to   partner with in this capacity.


Search Companies
In some cases, Pamlico will partner with a proven executive or management team to target a specific theme prior to investing in an initial platform. We call these situations “Search  Companies,” and will typically look to seed a new company and offer managers a  compelling financial and career opportunity as they help us buy and/or build a unique  new business. Search Company executives often become the ongoing leadership team for the new business, but can also participate at a Board or advisory level in certain situations. Search Company strategies typically target fragmented and dynamic growth sectors where  active management can create substantial value. 




For experienced executives interested in partnering with Pamlico, reach out to one of our professionals or submit your contact information.

Testimonials







After an extensive period vetting potential partners we chose Pamlico and they have lived up to every one of our expectations. We wanted a partner who would not only buy into but also provide resources for our organic growth strategy, a partner who would be a resource for us as we looked at our first acquisitions, and most importantly, we wanted a partner who bought into SEI’s unique Vision and culture as a way of growing our employees and our business. SEI employees work hard, have fun and get great results and we see those same principles playing out in our board meetings. Pamlico has been the right fit for SEI and we’re excited to have them as a partner!

Ron Alvesteffer, CEOSEI







Selling the company that you created and poured every ounce of your energy into is perhaps the most difficult, exciting, and emotional experience that a founder can have. Pamlico impressed me through every step of the process. They took the time to truly understand our philosophy, business, and values. Along this journey I have found Pamlico to be head and shoulders above the rest. Their investment and counsel is helping me to write the next chapter of our corporate history as we move from a company of success to one of significance. Pamlico shares my values and it was ultimately an easy decision to entrust them with my company.

Malbert Smith, CEO, President & Co-FounderMetaMetrics







We were excited to choose Pamlico as our growth equity partner. The Pamlico team’s knowledge of the Healthcare Information Technology space, the cultural fit and their pragmatic operating model made them stand out from the pack. The team has been a significant asset in helping us hone our strategy and assisting us in consummating significant strategic acquisitions. These actions have fueled growth beyond our expectations. We look forward to continuing our rapid growth with Pamlico as our partner.

Rick Pleczko, President & CEOsymplr







Pamlico differentiated themselves through their extensive knowledge of the construction software market and their collaborative approach to understanding and accelerating Dexter + Chaney’s growth initiatives.  Pamlico will provide capital and guidance to support investments in our product, broaden our marketing reach, and explore strategic acquisition opportunities, and we are thrilled to have them as a partner.

Norbert Orth, PresidentDexter + Chaney







I developed a strong relationship with Pamlico over 18 months, from our initial introduction in 2012 to Pamlico’s investment in Daxko in February 2014.  They have consistently been a confident sounding board and supportive partner to us as we pursue both organic growth initiatives within our core YMCA / JCC markets, as well as market-expanding acquisitions.  We are grateful for the leverage that Pamlico has provided to Daxko in each of these initiatives, and we are excited about the opportunities available to us through our partnership with them.

David Gray, President and CEODaxko








When I was looking to leave Siemens to do something more entrepreneurial, it was important for me to find a knowledgeable partner that could truly help me build a lasting business. Pamlico’s knowledge of the security industry and extensive experience supporting management teams in similar search company strategies made them the logical choice.  With their help and support, we are executing a targeted build-up of a select group of progressive systems integrators focused on managed security services and creating a unique industry player.

Carey Boethel, President & CEOSecuradyne Systems, LLC







I have had the pleasure to partner with Pamlico in building two cable companies over the past 12 years. When we first started working together in 2003, Pamlico already had a strong track record of investing in the cable business and was an invaluable partner in providing capital and expertise to help our team build NewWave Communications both organically and through several acquisitions. After successfully exiting NewWave in 2013, I was eager to continue a partnership with Pamlico and we formed a search company to pursue rural broadband investment opportunities together. Pamlico’s experience and guidance was critical in our ultimate carve-out of the Vast Broadband systems in 2014.

Jim Gleason, CEOVast Broadband







I first met Pamlico through their research in the hosted application management space, and together we refined an investment thesis and formed a search company to target the sector.   Through our partnership, we identified and acquired Secure-24, a founder-owned business in need of growth capital.  Pamlico continues to be an invaluable partner as we build the Company into an industry leader.

Mike Jennings, CEOSecure-24







Pamlico was instrumental in hiring me as the new CEO at Lightower and they have been a great partner in helping me build out the management team. They know the broadband infrastructure industry really well, which makes them valuable as we plan our network expansion and execute acquisitions.

Rob Shanahan, President & CEOLight Tower Holdings, LLC







We chose to partner with Pamlico because of its track record of accelerating portfolio companies’ growth and extensive healthcare investing experience. PE is poised to continue its growth by opening and acquiring new ASCs nationwide and by expanding product offerings with gastroenterologists across the country.  Pamlico provides our company with strong financial and advisory resources with which to build upon our market leadership position.

Barry Tanner, CEOPhysicians Endoscopy, LLC

PRESS RELEASE
CHARLOTTE, NC, November 21, 2016 – Pamlico Capital (“Pamlico”), a leading lower middle market private equity firm focused on growth oriented businesses, today announced the first and final close of Pamlico Capital IV (“PC IV”) at the hard cap with total commitments of $910 million.  PC IV raised its capital in only four months, was oversubscribed and significantly exceeded the original $750 million target.
 
Commitments to PC IV came from a diverse group of new and existing global investors comprised of leading fund of funds, insurance companies, corporate and foreign pension funds, endowments, foundations and family offices.
 
“We are very pleased and honored to have received such a high level of support from our current investors and are excited to partner with a few new investors in this fund and beyond,” said Pamlico Partner Art Roselle. “PC IV will build on our existing strategy of providing transformational capital to help accelerate the growth of businesses with untapped potential, often as a company’s first institutional investor. As we invest PC IV, we will leverage our industry expertise to pursue and capitalize on exciting investment opportunities in the lower middle market to drive value creation and improve operational performance.” 





 
Pamlico pursues investment opportunities primarily in lower middle market growth companies in the Business and Technology Services, Communications and Healthcare sectors in North America.  Pamlico’s investment strategy centers on the use of the team’s deep industry expertise and transactional experience to identify attractive sub-sectors within its three target industries where exceptional growth or consolidation opportunities exist and where Pamlico can take an active role helping management teams build value for shareholders.  As with Pamlico’s previous funds, PC IV will seek equity investments of $20 million to $100 million in companies with total enterprise values of between $50 million and $250 million.
 
“The significant interest in our fourth fund underscores the team’s experience, capability and strategy, as well as our investors’ confidence in our consistent track record of delivering strong returns,” added Pamlico Partner Eric Eubank. “Our hands-on approach to sourcing, monitoring and guiding investments has helped us deliver consistently strong returns for over 25 years.  PC IV will enable us to continue partnering with impressive management teams to drive change and accelerate growth while focusing on our theme-based investment approach.”
 
UBS Securities LLC acted as placement agent for Pamlico. Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. provided legal counsel.

Pamlico Capital has reached a final close on Pamlico Capital III with total commitments at the upwardly revised hard cap of $650 million. Pamlico Capital III is the firm’s first fund as a fully independent firm.
PRESS RELEASE
Pamlico Capital (“Pamlico”) today announced the final close of Pamlico Capital III, L.P. (“the Fund”), a private equity fund with total commitments at the upwardly revised hard cap of $650 million.
Pamlico Capital III is the firm’s first fund as a fully independent firm, and with an initial target of $500 million, was significantly oversubscribed. The Fund’s Limited Partners, which include all of the outside institutional investors from the predecessor fund, comprise an array of leading funds of funds, corporate and foreign pension funds, endowments, foundations and family offices. Leading institutional investors in Pamlico Capital III include AlpInvest Partners, Constitution Capital Partners, GE Pension Trust, HarbourVest Partners, affiliates of Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO), HOOPP Capital Partners (the private equity arm of the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan), John Hancock Financial Services, SCM Strategic Capital Management, AG and TIAA-CREF.
“Not only were we oversubscribed, but we raised the capital in a relatively short period of time, a testament to the quality of our team, our strong and consistent record and our sound investment strategy,” said Pamlico Managing Partner Scott Perper. “As with previous funds, Pamlico’s partners are committing significant capital to the Fund, firmly aligning us with the interests of our Limited Partners. The close of our first fund as an independent firm is a notable milestone for Pamlico, and I’d like to thank our Limited Partners, especially all our returning investors, for their commitment to the Fund and their trust in our firm.” 





Pamlico seeks to invest in control-oriented buyouts, primarily in lower middle market growth companies in the business and technology services, communications and healthcare sectors in North America. The firm targets businesses with untapped potential that can benefit from transformational capital to accelerate growth and increase profitability through improved sales strategies, acquisitions, expanded target markets and strengthened human capital. Pamlico’s investment strategy centers on using the team’s deep industry expertise and transactional experience to identify niche sub-sectors within its target industries where exceptional growth and/or consolidation opportunities exist, and then taking a very active role partnering with management teams to build value for shareholders. As with Pamlico’s previous funds, Pamlico Capital III will seek equity investments of $25 million to $75 million in companies with total enterprise values of between $50 million and $250 million.
“Collectively our team has decades of experience generating significant returns through partnering with talented managers to build great companies,” said Pamlico Managing Partner Eric Eubank. “We believe there is no substitute for the proven experience provided by a firm whose team has been investing together, in the same sectors, through numerous and varying economic cycles. As we invest Pamlico Capital III, we will pursue the same strategy we have successfully executed since inception, helping accelerate the growth of lower middle market businesses through active ownership.” 





“We have been investors with Pamlico since 2007, and are pleased to once again invest with the firm,” said Marek Herchel, Partner, AlpInvest Partners. “As one of the world’s largest private equity managers, AlpInvest seeks to place capital with firms that have demonstrated consistently strong performance. We have long been impressed with Pamlico’s successful investment track record and the continuity of its management team, and anticipate this will continue to be a highly rewarding and mutually beneficial relationship.”
Pamlico originated in 1988 as the private equity arm of First Union Corporation. The firm invested capital on behalf of First Union, its successors, and Pamlico’s investment professionals through 2007, when Pamlico raised outside capital for the first time. The Pamlico team formed Pamlico Capital in 2010 when the firm completed its spin out and became fully independent.
UBS Securities LLC acted as placement agent for Pamlico. Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. provided legal counsel.
