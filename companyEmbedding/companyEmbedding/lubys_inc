Step into one of our Fuddruckers restaurants and you’re in for a delicious, one-of-a-kind dining experience.
From the 100% fresh, never frozen, all American grilled-to-order beef and the scratch-baked bun prepared
daily, to the abundant toppings for making the perfect burger, our guests expect the quality and taste
that gave birth to the “better burger” segment.
Since 1980, our guests have been enjoying the World’s
Greatest Hamburgers®.   
But it doesn’t stop there. We’ve also been freshening up our buildings (inside and out), developing new
layouts to fit varied spaces, and enhancing menu offerings as part of our quest to provide the best burger
experience possible for our guests. We introduced this experience into downtown Houston with our
newest high-volume, bustling, friendly, quick-service Fuddruckers.
Today Fuddruckers has 62 company-operated restaurants and supports a 
franchise network of 117 locations and growing. These Fuddruckers 
restaurants are found coast to coast spanning 34 states, and include 
Puerto Rico and Canada. And recently, with a joint venture partner, 
we announced expansion south of the border, in Mexico, setting the 
stage for bringing the World's Greatest Hamburgers® to more 
communities both domestically and internationally.

We all need an occasional dose of Paradise. A laid back Beach Party where we can leave the stress of everyday life behind and enjoy an ice cold beverage or catch a ball game. A place where the food is awesome, the cocktails are hand crafted and you can enjoy a one-of-a-kind Kicked Back Vibe. Welcome, to Cheeseburger in Paradise.
We believe that the little details make a difference on the Island, so we use only fresh chicken, seafood and 100% ground choice chuck beef (never frozen). We combine the freshest high quality ingredients in all of our recipes, including our homemade salad dressings, sauces and seasonings. You'll experience the attention to detail and the concentration on quality in all of our dishes from our "New Beginnings" to "Sensuous Treats".
Jimmy Buffett's famous song comes to life at Cheeseburger In Paradise as guests wave goodbye to the real world and escape to paradise.   
Our Cheeseburgers may have made us famous, but our house specialties are what set us apart from "Just another Burger Joint." Dive in to our Grilled Atlantic Salmon, Calypso Chicken Salad, Jerk Chicken Wrap, Chocolate Nachos or awesome Kids' Menu.
Our Bar serves up cocktails with a distinctive Island flair. Try one of our famous frozen specialties with our signature "Garnimals." The coolness extends to our draft beer selection which is always pouring at an ice-cold 32 degrees. Try your favorite with one of our 100oz Beer Tubes!

When we talk about quality at Luby’s, it actually means something tangible, tasty and time-honored. For
more than 65 years, we’ve dedicated ourselves to preparing and serving the fresh fare our guests deserve.
It’s nothing less than real food, real ingredients and home-cooked, made from scratch dishes lovingly prepared
each day by people who are at home in the kitchen.   
Dedicated team members arrive early each day. Like fine dining chefs, they prepare the day’s entrées with
unprocessed, nutritious ingredients. Some begin by peeling and chopping fresh onions, carrots and celery
hearts for homemade sauces and gravies. Others are busy peeling potatoes, cutting fresh-from-the-farm
veggies or preparing Luby’s famous fried fish.
It all sounds pretty tasty, doesn’t it? It’s the only way we know how to do it at Luby’s.
While Luby’s is steeped in tradition, it’s a company looking toward the future. With a culinary commitment
to freshly prepared, healthy dishes, value-driven limited time offers and newly built prototype restaurants
throughout the greater Houston market, Luby’s is squarely focused on creating the next generation,
contemporary dining experience.

About Luby's: 


Over sixty years ago, Bob Luby had a dream. As a young man in his early twenties, he had a vision to develop a chain of cafeterias that would provide good food, good service and reasonable prices. 

Bob's vision was a product of his upbringing. In 1911, the year before Bob was born, his father, Harry Luby, stated the New England Dair Lunch cafeteria in Springfield, Missouri. Eventually, Harry's small cafeteria business grew to include restaurants in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. By 1927, at the age of 39, Harry Luby retired from active management. Bob, who had grown up in the business and loved it, was determined to enhance his father's principles and work ethic in his own new ideas and passion for serving top quality food in a welcoming atmosphere. 

In 1947, Bob returned to Texas from his WWII service as an intelligence officer stations in California. Determined and driven, Bob joined forces with his cousin Charles R Johnston, and together they opened the first Luby's Cafeteria in San Antonio, Texas. It was thought to be an extremely risky venture since downtown San Antonio was deserted at night, and many people doubted that servicemen just home from the war would accept standing in line for anything again. The skeptics were wrong- the 180-seat cafeteria was packed for both lunch and dinner. 

And so the Luby's Cafeteria chain began. Over the next 11 years, Luby and Johnston continued to open new restaurants in Tyler, Harlingen, El Paso and Beaumont. An interesting challenge of their early expansion was not the availability of capital or land, but rather, the accessibility of well-trained managers capable of maintaining Luby's uncompromisingly high-quality standards. 

In 1959, with nine cafeterias in various locations, the San Antonio-based company incorporated under the name Cafeterias, Inc. It became a publicly held corporation in 1973, then changed its name in 1981 to Luby's' Cafeterias, Inc. and joined the New York Stock Exchange the following year. In 1987, 40 years after its founding, Luby's reached a milestone when it's 100th cafeteria opened in Round Rock, Texas. 

In 2001, two of America's most successful restaurateurs, Chris and Harris Pappas of Houston, joined the Luby's management team, continuing the company's commitment to high standards of excellence. The Pappas brothers each brought 30 years of restaurant experience to the organization, which included Harris' own experience working for Luby's as a young man in the early 1970's.

For over 60 years, Luby's has forged a unique relationship with its customers. The emotional connection Luby's has with its diners is unlike any other restaurant company in America. Luby's success is due, in part, to consistently serving good food at reasonable prices. Another and no less important ingredient to that success is the understanding that meals can provide more than just nourishment. They can be memorable times that add warmth and meaning to all of our lives. 

Bob Luby's vision remains strong and continues to guide the company today, so future generations can create their own special Luby's memories.

Description
 



Lubys should easily go up 50% this year.  Since my write up on Feb 3 2015, Lubys stock price has not moved.  During the same amount of time, the CEO Chris Pappas and Director Harris Pappas have bought 789,961 shares for $3,967,952  at an average price of $5.02 per share.

The bright side is the most recent conference call of Lubys discussing Q1 FY2016 results.  It is one of the most positive conference call Lubys has had in a long while. 

Lubys reported Q1 FY2016 numbers that were substantially better than Q1 FY2015.  Ebitda was 5.7MM versus 3.3MM last year or a 73% increase.  The company is on track to do 34 million in EBITDA this FY2016.

The cost-cutting indicate that the company is operating at a lower fixed cost structure. Any increase in the revenues should contribute meaningfully to the bottom line.  Moreover, , the initiatives to train leadership development of employees could be long term improvements that should go past FY2016.  Barring a big recession, Lubys stock can easily double from here.  The value of the company is supported by the huge amount of real estate that they own. The debt can be paid off by selling just 6 of their combo concept real estate locations. 

Chris Pappas, the CEO who has been buying shares over the last year, said in the conference call, that “ Continuing our current momentum throughout 2016, we expect to generate positive net income in the second half of the year.”

“Total Company sales for the quarter increased $1.3 million to $120.7 million over last year, primarily driven by a $2.4 million increase in restaurant sales due to increased same-store sales and new unit sales offset by a decline in culinary contract service revenue of $1 million. Store level profit was $16.8 million in the first quarter or 14.8% of restaurant sales, up from 12.8% last year and up sequentially from 14.2% last quarter. Lower cost as a percentage of restaurant sales in all store level cost categories contributed to our improved store level profitability in the quarter.”

“The positive sales momentum, combined with store level operating -- lower store level operating expenses and reduced costs associated with opening stores all led to the $2.4 million increase in EBITDA that Chris previously discussed. The improvement in EBITDA represents a 70% increase over the comparable 16 weeks from the prior year. The significant increase in EBITDA occurred despite some significant investments in marketing and advertising in the quarter.”

“In fiscal 2016, we're focused on continuing to improve cash flows and EBITDA. Our team and I are not pleased with how the market is currently valuing the Company as evidenced by the stock price, but I am confident that in the direction and initiatives being executed by all of our teams that those are the keys to growing EBITDA to increase our shareholder value.”

Valuation: Little back of the envelope analysis here:

2016 EBITDA  $33 million
Maintenance Capex of $8 million
10 times EBITDA less Mtc Capex equates to $250MM Enterprise Value
With $35MM of debt, this is equivalent to $215MM market cap or $7.45 per share, a 50% upside from here.
This does not include the amount of real estate that they own.

Just to introduce the story to new readers, here are a few quick facts about  Lubys:


Trade on NYSE since 1982  


Approximately $400M in Annual Revenues  


System‐wide sales $540M (including Fuddruckers Franchises)  


FY2016 Q1 Trailing EBITDA of $20.5M  


Operate primarily 93 Luby’s Cafeterias, 77 Fuddruckers restaurants, and 8 Cheeseburger in Paradise Restaurants  


Operated Luby’s Cafeterias for 68+ years, Fuddruckers for 5+ Years, and Cheeseburger in Paradise over 2 years  


Support 111 Fuddruckers franchises across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Italy, Panama, Chile, Poland, and Colombia  Providing Contract Culinary Services at 28 locations



Products (Brands):

Luby’s Cafeterias was founded in 1947 in San Antonio, TX with a mission to be the most successful cafeteria company in America. By serving customers convenient, great‐tasting, home‐style meals at an excellent value in a friendly environment. 
Fuddruckers has been delivering uncompromised quality and in‐your‐face freshness while inspiring guests to build their own World’s Greatest Hamburger ® since 1980. Fuddruckers Hamburgers is known for its lively atmosphere, premium‐cut, grilled‐to‐order beef, scratch‐ made buns and market fresh produce. 

Cheeseburger in Paradise offers a laid back beach party atmosphere where guests can leave the stress of everyday life behind and enjoy an ice cold beverage. A place where the food is awesome, the cocktails are hand crafted and you can enjoy a one‐of‐a‐ kind Kicked Back Vibe.

Luby’s Culinary Services launched in 2006 with a mission to redefine the food contract service industry. To be the best, not necessarily the biggest, is the daily mantra across this growing brand that is designed to serve the corporate, hospital and higher education market. 

Management:

Chris Pappas – President, CEO, Director of Luby’s Inc. since March 2001 – More than 39 years of experience in restaurant industry  

Peter Tropoli – COO since 2011; General Counsel and SVP Administration since 2001 – 18 Years in restaurant industry  

Scott Gray, CPA – SVP and CFO since 2007; Finance and audit roles at Luby’s since 2001 – 19 Years in restaurant industry  

Todd Coutee – SVP Operations since 2011 – 25 Years in restaurant industry, including 12 years in contract services


Store-level profitability for Q4 2015 reached 14.8% from 11.6% and 12.8% in the 2 years before.



Q1 FY2016 also marked the greatest number of Fuddruckers franchisee openings in a single quarter since Lubys acquired the Fuddruckers brand in 2010, which means a nice increase in high-quality royalty income for Lubys.
Last year, mitc567 thought Fuddruckers royalty income is shrinking and in long-term decline.  This year’s growth in franchisees is a positive development.


Company same-store sales for Q1 FY2016 bode well for the  rest of the year as company’s Q1 historically has not been good for the last 3 years.  Last year, mitc567 reasonably stated that he thinks Luby’s could not be turned around even by the great operators like the Pappas.  While not a lot, this last quarter’s increase in same-store sales is at least encouraging.



EBITDA of $33MM looks achievable, even by historical standards. 



Total Revenue of > $400MM is also quite achievable, by historical standards.

 




 I  hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Catalyst
First positive and upbeat quarterly results in a while
Pipeline of royalty income
Positive comparable same store sales
Continued insider buying by CEO and Directors
Risks:
Economic recession can hurt restaurant industry substantially

Peter Tropoli – COO since 2011; General Counsel and SVP Administration since 2001 – 18 Years in restaurant industry  

Scott Gray, CPA – SVP and CFO since 2007; Finance and audit roles at Luby’s since 2001 – 19 Years in restaurant industry  

Todd Coutee – SVP Operations since 2011 – 25 Years in restaurant industry, including 12 years in contract services


Store-level profitability for Q4 2015 reached 14.8% from 11.6% and 12.8% in the 2 years before.



Q1 FY2016 also marked the greatest number of Fuddruckers franchisee openings in a single quarter since Lubys acquired the Fuddruckers brand in 2010, which means a nice increase in high-quality royalty income for Lubys.
Last year, mitc567 thought Fuddruckers royalty income is shrinking and in long-term decline.  This year’s growth in franchisees is a positive development.


Company same-store sales for Q1 FY2016 bode well for the  rest of the year as company’s Q1 historically has not been good for the last 3 years.  Last year, mitc567 reasonably stated that he thinks Luby’s could not be turned around even by the great operators like the Pappas.  While not a lot, this last quarter’s increase in same-store sales is at least encouraging.



EBITDA of $33MM looks achievable, even by historical standards. 



Total Revenue of > $400MM is also quite achievable, by historical standards.

 




 I  hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
First positive and upbeat quarterly results in a while
Pipeline of royalty income
Positive comparable same store sales
Continued insider buying by CEO and Directors
Risks:
Economic recession can hurt restaurant industry substantially
