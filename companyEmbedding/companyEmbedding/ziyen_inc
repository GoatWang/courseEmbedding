In the past only wealthy institutions, venture capitalists and angel investors could provide early stage private investments in the latest start-ups, but this has all changed through the JOBS Act.
This historic moment marks the first time in over eighty years that anyone will have access to investing in early stage companies, and we invite all new investors to come on board and join us on our journey.’

Ziyen Inc. sponsors Scottish Junior Curling Team

 | Source: Ziyen Inc.






SAN DIEGO, June  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ziyen Inc. CEO, Alastair Caithness, announced they will become a sponsor of Team Craik, a Scottish Junior Curling Team for the next 12 months. Curling originated from Scotland in the 16th century and is one of the world’s oldest team sports, where games were originally played during winter on frozen ponds and lochs.  Ziyen Inc. with over 300,000 followers across social media will provide their expertise to increase the profile of Team Craik across the social networks and develop the brand of Team Craik across the curling community. Team Craik are one of the most competitive Junior Curling Teams on the Scottish circuit and already are sponsored by Fitbit, Foxglide, DM Carnegie, Jess Food Group, Forfar Indoor Sport and Bryce Suma Post Drivers. Team Craik team is made up of James Craik (skip), Fraser Shaw, Mark Watt, Angus Bryce, Niall Ryder & Mathew Mckenzie (U17s), coached by Gordon Kennedy. Alastair Caithness, CEO, said “Curling has always been an important game in Scotland, and we are delighted to sponsor Team Craik for next season. With the growth of our company, it is important to always remember your roots and it is our goal to assist in helping Scottish Teams and Scottish Sports going forward. I’ve known James since he was a little nipper. He is an exceptional sportsman, already having represented Scotland at Taekwon-do, and I believe James with his team have every chance to go on and represent Scotland & Great Britain at curling in future. James comes from a well-known curling family, with his father Gordon being an excellent curler in his day and his grandfather Bobby Craik winning the World Curling Outdoor Grand Match Championship back in 1979. Good Luck to Team Craik and we expect big things going forward.” More about Ziyen Inc. Ziyen Inc., was qualified by the SEC under Regulation A+ and is aiming for quick completion of the listing process on the markets in 2017. In the past only wealthy institutions and angel investors could provide early stage private investments in the latest start-ups, but this has all changed through the JOBS Act. Through Regulation A+, barriers everyday citizens have experienced in participating in early stage private investment have now vanished.
