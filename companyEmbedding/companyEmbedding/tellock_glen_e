Manitowoc Company Announces Management Transition                                                   


The Manitowoc Company, Inc. announced that the company’s board of directors has elected Glen E. Tellock, as president and chief executive officer, effective immediately.  Tellock succeeds Terry D. Growcock, 61, who will remain chairman of the board of directors through 2008.  Tellock was also appointed to serve on the board for a term that expires in 2008.  
Prior to being named CEO, Tellock had been senior vice president of The Manitowoc Company and president of Manitowoc Crane Group since 2002. 
Growcock had been the company’s president and chief executive officer since 1998 and has served as chairman of the board since October 2002. He has also been a director since 1998.  




Manitowac Appoints Tellock President of Crane Group                                                 

The Manitowac Company, Inc. named senior vice president and chief financial officer Glen E. Tellock as president and general manager of Manitowac’s Crane Group, effective immediately. “With the pending Grove acquisition, we assessed the organizational needs required to run a billion-dollar crane segment. Glen’s solid financial experience will be a tremendous asset in managing our crane business, which has tripled in size in the last 14 months,” said Terry D. Growcock, Manitowac’s president and CEO. “As senior vice president and CFO, Glen was intimately involved in setting the strategic direction for the company, and played an instrumental role in the successful acquisition of Potain and our pending acquisition of Grove Worldwide.



Manitowoc Announces Closing of National Crane Facility                                              

The Manitowoc Company, Inc. announced today that it will close its National Crane boom-truck manufacturing facility in Waverly, NE and will move production to the company's facility in Shady Grove, PA. Both facilities were acquired when Manitowoc purchased Grove Worldwide last year. The closing is expected to take place by the end of 2003. The transfer of production will improve long-term utilization and productivity given the advanced systems already in place at Shady Grove. Proceeds from the sale of assets are expected to equal or slightly exceed the after-tax costs associated with the move. These costs will primarily be reflected as an adjustment to the purchase price of Grove Worldwide.



Manitowoc Sells Marine Business

On Jan. 2, the Manitowoc Company, Inc. (NYSE:MTW) announced the completion, effective as of December 31, 2008, of the previously announced sale of its Marine segment to Fincantieri Marine Group Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Fincantieri - Cantieri Navali Italiani SpA (Fincantieri). The net purchase price in the all-cash deal was approximately $120m. Manitowoc intends to use the after-tax proceeds for debt reduction and other corporate purposes. "We are now entirely focused on two strategic lines of business: cranes and commercial foodservice equipment," said Manitowoc CEO Glen E. Tellock. "We have built market leadership positions in both of these global markets, and now will be able to direct all of our efforts on growing these two businesses even further.

 




















Union Ratifies New Contract with Manitowoc                                                          

The Manitowoc Company, Inc., announced today that the International Association of Machinists (IAM) Local 516 has ratified a new five-year contract with Manitowoc Cranes. Under the terms of the agreement, workers will receive cash bonuses in the first year of the contract and wage rate increases in the second through fifth years. The approximately 120 IAM Local 516 members, based in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, walked off the job at midnight on November 18. The previous contract for the Local expired on October 31, 2003. The union bargaining committee and the company returned to the negotiating table yesterday and reached a tentative agreement, which was ratified by the Local 516 membership earlier today.



Marinette Marine Sold For $48 Million                                                               

Manitowoc Co. Inc. reportedly signed an agreement to buy private shipyard operator Marinette Marine Corp. for about $48 million cash. The deal is expected to add to about 5 to 10 cents a share to 2001 earnings, said chief financial officer Glen Tellock. The final price will be subject to closing balance sheet adjustments. The transaction, expected to close within 30 days pending regulatory approvals, will be financed with an existing credit facility. "Marinette Marine is one of the most efficient builders of mid-sized commercial, research, and military vessels in the country and will be a key strategic fit with the industry-leading inspection…



Manitowoc  and Kobel Sign Crawler Crane Agreement                                                   

Manitowoc Crane Group, a business entity of The Manitowoc Company, Inc., has announced an agreement with Kobelco Construction Machinery Co. of Tokyo, Japan, under which Kobelco will supply Manitowoc with a range of lattice-boom crawler cranes with lift capacities under 150 tons. These Manitowoc-branded products will be introduced in the second quarter of 2004. The lattice-boom cranes supplied to Manitowoc by Kobelco will be clearly differentiated from Kobelco’s own product offering. All new models will be sold and supported through Manitowoc’s existing dealer and product support networks. Manitowoc has not yet issued the model designations for the new cranes. Kobelco will continue to market and distribute its own full line of lattice-boom crawler cranes, from 55 U.S. tons to 250 U.S.



BP's Glen Lyon FPSO Hook-up Underway


Mechanical engineering specialist EnerMech said it is in the process of delivering a £5-million-plus contract to support the turret delivery team on BP’s Glen Lyon FPSO, which has arrived for hook-up operations West of Shetland. The Glen Lyon is a key element of the multibillion pound Quad204 project, which includes redeveloping the Schiehallion and Loyal fields, extending production out to 2035 and possibly beyond. EnerMech provided winch engineering, associated operations and… 



LR Verifies BP FPSO Glen Lyon


The Glen Lyon floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, BP’s newest North Sea asset, was awarded full-term classification certificates for service in the Schiehallion and Loyal fields, 175 km west of Shetland. Conditions west of Shetland are among the most severe in the UK and Glen Lyon must be capable of operating in extreme weather. Classification means the Glen Lyon FPSO has been verified for operation to the highest levels of safety and performance by LR. Glen Lyon is the world’s largest harsh water FPSO and formed part of BP’s multi-billion-pound Quad 204 project. 



Putting the Garbage Out

Keep the seas clean in 2013, reminds North P&I Club, as new international garbage rules take effect. North P&I Club reminds its members that 2013 is the first full year of operation of new international garbage-disposal rules that greatly limit the dumping of garbage at sea. According to North's loss prevention manager Andrew Glen, ‘With very few specific exceptions, the new rules reverse the historical presumption that most garbage can be discharged at a suitable distance offshore. In July 2011 the International Maritime Organization adopted amendments to Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) in Resolution MEPC.201(62), and issued guidelines for their implementation in Resolutions MEPC.219(63) and MEPC.220(63).

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORELakeside Foods has announced that President and CEO Dave Yanda will retire at the end of May and former Manitowoc Company CEO Glen Tellock has been chosen as his successor.Yanda has spent the past 43 years with Lakeside, working in a variety of sales and management roles before leading the company beginning in 2008.Under his leadership, Lakeside received numerous industry and customer awards and was a leader in the private label canned and frozen vegetable industry.Yanda also oversaw company efforts to expand product lines and enter new markets.“We have been very fortunate to have Dave as part of our company over the years, especially as president and CEO the past eight,” said Doug Quick, Lakeside’s chairman and former CEO, in a news release. “He has led our company well, personifying the best of our values both inside and outside of Lakeside.” (Photo: Courtesy Lakeside Foods)Tellock arrives after a 24-year career at the Manitowoc Company. He resigned in October as chairman, president and CEO, with the company on the cusp of splitting its Foodservice and Cranes divisions into separate companies.“He has the values and the character that have seemed to align with Lakeside’s culture,” said Tom Reilly, the company’s senior vice president of human resources. ”He’s active in the community and known and respected, and he has a tremendous record of good business success that we’re happy and fortunate to match up with our business.”The Manitowoc-based food processor, which is privately held, has 12 plants and six distribution centers in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ohio.The company produces canned and frozen vegetables, dry beans, canned meats, pet food and other food products for major brands.Employment peaks in late summer, when the company employs about 580 people in Manitowoc County and about 2,150 company-wide.In recent years, Yanda has led the company's push into new markets, which has brought sales growth and a more diversified product line.Lakeside is now among the top national producers of store-brand whipped toppings and is a major producer of store-brand frozen vegetables. The company has also made significant inroads into the pet food and canned meat sectors."The whole strategy has been to diversify the company so we are not as heavily dependent on one business segment, as there are cycles to all these segments," Yanda said.Yanda, 65, said he's been working with the company on a succession plan for over a year.He plans to continue serving as a board member at area companies and will remain active in various business associations. He also plans to spend more time with his wife, Sue, and will put more time into his hobbies, including hunting, fishing and golf."There are a lot of things I haven't had time to do in quite some time with the demands of running a business this size," he said. "I'll still be busy, but I won't be busy like I am today."Reach Josh Lintereur at 920-453-5147, jlintereur@gannett.com or on Twitter @joshlintereur

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Khail. Please go ahead.Steven C. Khail - Director-Investor Relations & CommunicationsGood morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Manitowoc's second quarter earnings conference call. Participating in today's call will be Glen Tellock, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Carl Laurino, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Glen will open today's call by providing comments related to our quarterly results and business outlook. Carl will then discuss our financial results for the second quarter in greater detail. Following our prepared remarks, we will be joined by Larry Weyers, President of Manitowoc Cranes, and Bob Hund, President of Manitowoc Foodservice for our question-and-answer session.For anyone who is not able to listen to today's entire call, an archived version of this call will be available later this morning. Please visit the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at www.manitowoc.com to access the replay.Before Glen begins his commentary, I would like to review our Safe Harbor statement. This call is taking place on July 30, 2015. During the course of today's call, forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 will be made during each speaker's remarks and during our question-and-answer session. Such statements are based on the company's current assessment of its markets and other factors that affect its business. However, actual results could differ materially from any implied projections due to one or more of the factors explained in Manitowoc's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on our website.The Manitowoc Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events, or other circumstances.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glen.Glen E. Tellock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The results we reported yesterday reflected another challenging quarter for our businesses. While we saw stability in certain product categories within cranes, macroeconomic headwinds and weak oil prices continue to create a level of uncertainty in the rough terrain and boom truck markets that weighed heavily in our cranes results. That said, we have taken decisive actions over recent quarters to respond to those areas that are within our control. For example, over the past 12 months, we have eliminated $30 million of direct and indirect costs and continue to pursue more opportunities to streamline our manufacturing processes. The good news is that the balance of our crane business performed in line with our expectations and we are seeing demand improvement in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America.Turning to Foodservice, we saw improvement as we progressed through the quarter which underscores the corrective actions we have put in place throughout the business. While certain areas are still experiencing softness particularly reduced CapEx spending by large chains, other expects of our business are doing well, particularly, cold-side products as well as ovens and grills in the United States. The notable improvement we experienced in June has continued into the third quarter and we are cautiously optimistic that Foodservice is turning the corner.We're now seeing the benefits of the actions we have taken within our KitchenCare business and the execution issues reported in previous quarters are largely behind us. Our parts flow and order fill rates have dramatically improved, our backlog has diminished, capacity has now aligned and our monthly operating cost are down nearly 40% from the peak. As a result, KitchenCare sales are up modestly on a year-over-year basis and up sharply on a sequential basis.Besides KitchenCare, we continue to make progress on our 80/20 Business Simplification initiative which is expected to drive substantial improvement in our operating profit over the next several years. In essence, this initiative is driving transformational change in our culture. This will allow us to focus on sales, customer support and product development efforts in the most efficient way to grow our business and drive profitability.We are expecting to generate as much as 150 basis points of margin by simply employing our time and resources more judicially through 2017. Once again, our technology leadership in the Foodservice market was validated as we won two Kitchen Innovation Awards at the recent National Restaurant Association Trade Show. In addition, McDonald's named us Innovator of the Year for our superior frying technology and we received the ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for the sixth year in a row.In addition, we received the Supplier of the Year Award from Subway last night in Las Vegas. We also continue to receive favorable results for our Convotherm 4 ovens. Customer feedback has been extremely positive with some stating that its performance and reliability is the best they've ever experienced.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Glen E. Tellock, Chairman/CEO of The Manitowoc Company Inc (MTW), Speaks at Baird’s 2014 Industrial Conference - The Wall Street Transcript














































 






































Glen E. Tellock, Chairman/CEO of The Manitowoc Company Inc (MTW), Speaks at Baird’s 2014 Industrial Conference
November 12, 2014
The Manitowoc Company Inc (MTW) is “situated quite well,” said Glen E. Tellock, Chairman/CEO of the Manitowoc Company, and will start to “go on the offensive” in the coming months after “being on the defensive” for some time.  He was speaking at Baird’s 2014 Industrial Conference, held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
The Wisconsin-based Manitowoc has two business platforms — food service, which accounts for 38% of sales, and cranes, which is 62% of sales. It does 56% of its business in North America, with Europe accounting for 23% and the Asia Pacific region at 12%.

Although acknowledging that “you don’t see a lot of growth in the crane business and some stubbed growth on the food side,” Tellock said Manitowoc is focused on improving its margins through operational tweaks, and is positioning itself to “leverage the upside in the opportunities we may have.”
The company’s number one priority is “paying down debt,” but Tellock also said, “We will invest in the business.”
Manitowoc is under construction for a multipurpose food service plant in Monterrey, Mexico, consolidating its beverage facilities in Tijuana, Mexico, and consolidating its oven business in Cleveland, Ohio, among other maneuvers. Tellock said the company “has some egg on its face” with regard to declines in forecasted financial guidance for its cranes business. He said geopolitical uncertainty has made customers “nervous to punch that ticket and buy something new” in the cranes business, but noted that customers continue to rent their equipment.
