Variable investment options














Variable annuities
Variable annuities offer market growth potential based on the investment options you choose.
A variable annuity may be a good choice if you're willing to tolerate some market risk in exchange for growth potential.




Variable annuities can offer:

Tax-deferred growth
Variable investment options
Income options, including income for life
Death benefit options
Optional benefits that may help protect your retirement assets and income (available at an additional cost)

How do variable annuities work?



1 . Customize your investment
You give the insurance company money in one or more payments. Some variable annuities let you choose a number of variable investment options, while others offer a predetermined mix of investments.



2 . Accumulation phase
Your contract’s value may increase – or decrease – depending on the performance of the investments you choose. Variable annuities involve risk, and it’s possible to lose money.





3 . Tax-deferred growth
You defer paying taxes on any gain in your contract until you receive money from the contract. Tax-deferred growth means the money stays in your contract and has potential to grow faster.



4 . Distribution phase
After a period of time specified by your contract you may then receive the amount allowed by your contract in a lump sum, over a set period of time, or as income for the rest of your life.

A variable annuity isn't an appropriate solution for everyone, and you shouldn't buy one unless it's appropriate for your situation. Purchasing an annuity is an important decision, and one you should only make after consulting
                            with your financial professional and tax advisor.

Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Purchasing an annuity within a retirement plan that provides tax deferral under sections of the Internal Revenue Code results in no additional tax benefit. An annuity should be used to fund a qualified plan based upon the annuity’s features other than tax deferral. All annuity features, risks, limitations, and costs should be considered prior to purchasing an annuity within a tax-qualified retirement plan.
Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any protection benefits. Withdrawals taken within the contract withdrawal charge schedule will be subject to a withdrawal charge. All withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal additional tax.
For more complete information about variable annuities and variable investment options, call your financial professional or Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 800.624.0197 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other information about the variable annuity and variable investment options, which you should carefully consider. Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

Investment Options




























You could lose money by investing in the AZL Government Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 7 Day Current Yield more closely reflects the current earnings than the total return.
The Allianz Investment Management LLC, Allianz Global Investors, NFJ Investment Group LLC, RCM Capital Management LLC, and PIMCO investment options are managed by an affiliate of Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York and Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC. All are affiliated companies.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. To access the most current month-end performance, please select Standardized Monthly Performance from the View Type above.
Performance is calculated on the basis of historical performance of each investment option. Actual performance from the date the Separate Account began investing in the investment option is shown. Performance figures show the change in value of a hypothetical investment over the indicated periods, assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
Standardized performance.
  Standardized performance information reflects the deduction of the Mortality and Expense risk (M&E) charge except Allianz Index Advantage® Variable Annuity and Allianz Index Advantage® New York Variable Annuity and Allianz Index Advantage ADVSM Variable Annuity, which have a product fee instead of an M&E charge.
Standardized performance for Index Advantage ADVSM Variable Annuity does not reflect deduction of the withdrawal charge as the withdrawal charge only applies to, and is only deducted from, the index options. Standardized performance information for all listed products also reflects the fees and expenses of the investment options after reductions for fee waivers and expense reimbursements, contract maintenance charge, and withdrawal charge as follows:




Withdrawal Charge Schedule




 Allianz VisionSM Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz VisionSM New York Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz ConnectionsSM Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage® Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage® New York Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 6.5%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage NFSM  Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 0%



The M&E charge is assessed daily against the investment option’s net asset value (NAV). The product fee and a contract maintenance charge of 0.01% are shown as assessed against the investment options NAV on the last day of each year (or the last day of the period for any period of less than one year) and the withdrawal charge is shown as assessed against the NAV on the last day of each period using the withdrawal charge percentage that would apply at that time. The product fee, contract maintenance charge and withdrawal charge are not reflected as actually calculated and deducted. They are shown as a representation of these fee's impacts on fund performance. This may overstate or understate actual performance.
Standardized performance information does not reflect the deduction of any optional rider charge. Performance would be lower if the investment options fees were calculated before reductions for waivers and reimbursements, or if rider charges were deducted. Investment option fee waivers and expense reimbursements are not permanent and may be discontinued. Please see the prospectus for more details on contract expenses and charges.

Applicants' Representations
1. Allianz Life was organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota in 1896. Allianz Life offers fixed and variable life insurance and annuities and group life, accident and health insurance. Allianz Life is licensed to do direct business in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Allianz Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Versicherungs AG Holding.
2. Preferred Life was organized under the laws of the state of New York. Preferred Life offers annuities and group life, group accident and health insurance and variable annuity products. Preferred Life is licensed to do business in six states, including New York and the District of Columbia. Preferred Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Versicherungs AG Holding.
3. Allianz Account A is a segregated asset account of Allianz Life. Allianz Account A was established by Allianz Life on May 31, 1985, under Minnesota insurance laws. Allianz Account A is used to fund certain life insurance policies issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account A is divided into several subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof. Allianz Account A is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.
4. Allianz Account B is a segregated asset account of Allianz Life. Allianz Account B was established by Allianz Life on May 31, 1985, under Minnesota insurance laws. Allianz Account B is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account B is divided into several subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof. Allianz Account B is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.
5. Preferred Life Account C is a segregated asset account of Preferred Life. Preferred Life Account C was established by Preferred Life on February 26, 1988 under New York insurance laws. Preferred Life Account C is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Preferred Life. Preferred Life Account C is divided into several subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof. Preferred Account C is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.
6. The segregated asset accounts support certain variable annuity contracts and variable life policies (collectively, the “Contracts”) issued by the Insurance Company Applicants. Under the Contracts, the Insurance Company Applicants reserved the right to substitute one of the variable investment options with another variable investment option after Start Printed Page 14604appropriate notice. Moreover, the Insurance Company Applicants are entitled to limit further investment in a variable investment option if the respective Insurance Company Applicants deem the variable investment option inappropriate. Thus, the Contracts permit the Insurance Company Applicants to substitute the respective class of shares of the Replaced Fund with the corresponding class of shares of the Substituting Fund.
7. The Trust was organized as a Massachusetts business trust on April 26, 1988. The Trust includes a number of funds, including the Replaced fund and the Substituting Fund. Shares of the Replaced fund are sold to the Separate Account Applicants for the purpose of funding the Contracts. The Pacific Growth Fund is managed by Franklin Advisers, Inc. (“FAI”) and Templeton Asset Management Ltd.—Hong Kong branch (“TAM Hong Kong”) is the sub-adviser. Neither FAI nor TAM Kong is affiliated with the Applicants. Templeton investment Counsel, Inc. (“TIC”) manages the International Fund. TIC is not affiliated with the Applicants. The Trust currently offers two classes of shares for the Pacific Growth Fund and the International Fund. The Class 1 shares and Class 2 shares represent proportionate interests in each fund's assets and are identical except that the Class 2 shares bear the expense of the Class 2 distribution plan. The Trust is registered as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act its shares are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933. 
8. The Applicants have determined that due to the fact that the Replaced Fund (i) has diminished in size, apparently due to lack of interest, (ii) has had a negative performance history and higher expense ratios, and (iii) has been subject to excessive market timing, it would be best for the respective Insurance Company Applicants and the Owners to substitute the shares of the Replaced Fund with shares of another mutual fund or portfolio having similar objectives. Accordingly, Applicants request the Commission's approval to effect the substitution of the respective class of shares of the Replaced Fund with a corresponding class of shares of the Substituting Fund (the “Substitution”). 
9. For the Class 1 shares of the Pacific Growth Fund held on behalf of their respective Separate Account Applicants at the close of business on the date selected for the Substitution, the Insurance Company Applicants will redeem those shares for cash or in-kind. Simultaneously, the Insurance Company Applicants, on behalf of their respective Separate Account Applicants, will place a purchase order for Class 1 shares of the International Fund so that each purchase will be for the exact amount of the redemption proceeds, which may be partly or wholly-in kind. The Insurance Company Applicants will act likewise, on behalf of their respective Separate Account Applicants with respect to the Class 2 shares of the Replaced and Substituting Funds. Accordingly, at all times monies attributable to Contract owners (“Owners”) then invested in the Replaced Fund will remain fully invested and will result in no change in the amount of any Owner's contract value, death benefit or investment in the applicable Separate Account Applicant. Moreover, by substituting corresponding classes of shares of the Replaced and Substituting Funds, the Owners who were subject to a 12b-1 distribution plan will continue to be subject to such plan. Those Owners who were not subject to a 12b-1 distribution plan will not be subject to such plan after the Substitution. 
10. In connection with the redemption of all shares of the Replaced Fund, it is anticipated that the replaced Fund will incur brokerage fees and expenses in connection with such redemption. To alleviate that potential impact, the redemption will be effected partly for cash and partly for portfolio securities redeemed “in-kind.” The Trust has informed Applicants that it will cooperate with Applicants to effect the redemptions partly in-kind and in cash. In addition, Applicants will use the in-kind and cash redemption proceeds to purchase shares of the Substituting Fund. In effecting the in-kind redemptions and transfers, the Trust has informed the Applicants that it will comply with the requirements of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act and the procedures established thereunder by the Board of Trustees of the Trust. 
11. As noted above, the portfolio securities received from the in-kind redemption will be used together with the cash proceeds to purchase the shares of the Substituting Fund. The Applicants have determined that partially effecting the redemption of shares of the Replaced fund in-kind is appropriate, based on the similarity of certain types of the portfolio securities that may be held by the Replaced Fund and the Substituting Fund. The Trust has advised the Applicants that the valuation of any in-kind transactions will be made on a basis consistent with the normal valuation procedures of the Replaced fund and that of the Substituting Fund. 
12. The full net asset value of the redeemed shares held by the Separate Account Applicants will be reflected in the Owner's contract values following the Substitution. The Applicants represent that the Owners will not bear any expenses for the Substitution so that the full net asset value of redeemed shares of the Replaced fund held by the Separate Account Applicants will be reflected in the Owners' contract values following the Substitution. 
13. The Trust is fully advised of the terms of the Substitution. Applicants anticipate that until the Substitution occurs, the Trust will conduct the trading of portfolio securities in accordance with the investment objectives and strategies stated in the Replaced Fund's prospectuses and in a manner that provides for the anticipated redemptions of shares held by the Separate Account Applicants. 
14. Applicants have determined, based on advice of counsel familiar with insurance laws, that the Contracts allow the Substitution as described in the application, and that the transactions can be consummated as described therein under applicable insurance laws and under the Contracts. These contractual provisions have also been disclosed in the prospectus or statements of additional information relating to the Contracts. In addition, prior to effecting the Substitution, Applicants will have complied with any regulatory requirements they believe are necessary to complete the transactions in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale. 
15. Owners will not directly or indirectly incur any expense, including brokerage expenses, as a result of the Substitution, and the rights or obligations of the Insurance Company Applicants under the applicable Contracts will not be altered in any way. The proposed Substitution will not have any adverse tax consequences to Owners. The proposed Substitution will not cause Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. The proposed Substitution will not be treated as transfers for the purpose of assessing transfer charges. The Insurance Company Applicants will not, with respect to shares substituted, exercise any right it may have under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers for a period of thirty-one days from the mailing of the a notice of the Substitution (the “Notice”) to the Owners (the “Free Transfer Period”). In addition, such a transfer will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the Start Printed Page 14605number of transfers that may be made without charge. 
16. The Insurance Company Applicants have supplemented the prospectuses for the Contracts to reflect the Substitution. Within five days after the Substitution, the Insurance Company Applicants will send to Owners the Notice which will identify the shares of the Replaced Fund that have been eliminated and the shares of the Replaced Fund that have been eliminated and the shares of the Substituting Fund that have been substituted. The Insurance Company Applicants will include in such mailing the applicable prospectus supplement for the Contracts of the Separate Account Applicants describing the Substitution. For those Contracts that already include the Substituting Fund as an underlying variable investment option, the Insurance Company Applicants do not intend to mail a copy of the prospectus for the substituting Fund to the Owners, because they already will have received a copy of those prospectuses in the ordinary course. For those Contracts that do not include the Substituting Fund, the applicable Insurance Company Applicants will have amended the applicable registration statement and will provide a copy of the prospectus supplement of the Contract and the prospectus of the Substituting Fund with the notice. Owners will be advised in the Notice that for a period of thirty-one days from the mailing of the Notice, Owners may transfer all assets, as substituted, to any other available subaccount without charge or limitation, and such transfers will not be counted toward any applicable limitation on transfers. 
17. The annual operating expenses of the Replaced Fund and the Substituting Fund as of December 31, 2000 as a percentage of average daily net assets are as follows:
[In percent] Class 1 sharesClass 2 sharesPacific growth fundInternational fundPacific growth fundInternational fundAdvisory and Fund Administrative Charges1.00.781.00.78Distribution Expenses.00.00.25.25Other Expenses.10.09.10.09Total Expenses1.10.871.311.12
18. As of December 31, 2000, the Replaced Fund and the Substituting Fund had the following net assets:
[In millions]Class 1 sharesClass 2 sharesPacific growth fundInternational fundPacific growth fundInternational fund$50.0$776.5$.3$187.1
19. Applicants represent that the Insurance Company Applicants do not, and will not for three years, receive any direct or indirect benefit from the Substituting Fund or its adviser (or the adviser's affiliates) that exceeds the amount it had received from the Replaced Fund, its adviser, and/or the adviser's affiliates, including 12b-1, shareholder service, administration or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangement, either with specific reference to the Substituting Fund or as part of an overall business arrangement.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the [Commission] shall have approved such substitution.” Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act was enacted as part of the Investment Company Act Amendments of 1970. Prior to the enactment of these amendments, a depositor of a unit investment trust could substitute new securities for those held by the trust by notifying the trust's security holders of the substitution within five (5) days after the substitution. In 1966, the Commission, concerned with the high sales charges then common to most unit investment trusts and the disadvantageous position in which such charges placed investors who did not want to remain invested in the substituted security, recommended that Section 26 be amended to require that a proposed substitution of the underlying investments of a trust receive prior Commission approval.
2. Applicants represent that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution are consistent with the principles and purposes of Section 26(b) and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(b) is designed to prevent. Owners will be assessed no charges whatsoever in connection with the Substitution and their annual fund expense ratios are expected to decrease. In addition, to the extent an Owner does not wish to participate in the Substitution, he or she will have thirty one days to transfer to any other option available under the relevant Contract prior to the Substitution and after the Substitution without any transfer fee. Moreover, as described below, Applicants assert that the Owners will be substituted into a Substituting Fund whose investment objectives, policies and expenses are substantially similar or identical in all material respects to those of the Replaced Fund.
3. Applicants submit that the Substitution does not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that Section 26(b) was intended to guard against and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act and assert the following in support of this contention:
(a) The Substitution will continue to fulfill Owners' objectives and risk expectations, because the investment objectives of the Pacific Growth Fund are substantially similar to those of the International fund;
(b) After receipt of the Notice informing an Owner of the Substitution, an Owner may request that his or her assets be reallocated to another subaccount at any time during the Free Transfer Period. The Free Transfer Period provides sufficient time for Owner to consider their reinvestment options;
(c) The Substitution will be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge;
(d) Neither the Owners, the Replaced Fund nor the Substituting Fund will bear any cost of the Substitution, and accordingly, the Substitution will have no impact on the Owners' Contract values;Start Printed Page 14606

(e) The Substitution will in no way alter the contractual obligations of the respective Insurance Company Applicants or the rights and privileges of Owners under the Contracts:
(f) The Substitution will in no way alter the tax benefits to Owners; and
(g) The Substitution is expected to confer certain economic benefits on Owners by virtue of enhanced asset size and lower expenses, as described above.
4. Applicants contend that the Substituting Fund and the Replaced Fund share similar investment objectives. The Pacific Growth Fund and the International Fund seek to provide long-term capital growth. The Pacific Growth Fund pursues its objectives by investing primarily in common stocks of Pacific Rim companies and under normal conditions at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities that trade in Pacific Rim markets, including those in emerging markets. The International Fund pursues its objectives by investing at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities of companies located outside the U.S., including those in emerging markets. The manager for each of these funds employs the same investment philosophy of bottom-up, value-oriented, long-term selection of portfolio securities. Thus, both funds invest primarily in equity securities of companies located outside the U.S. and employ the same investment selection strategy. Moreover, Morningstar, Inc. classifies the Pacific Growth and International Funds as large capitalization stock funds.
5. Applicants assert that the primary difference between the Pacific Growth Fund and the International Fund is their concentration in a particular region. As of September 30, 2000, the International Fund invested approximately 57% in European issuers and approximately 21% in Asian issuers. As of September 30, 2000, the Pacific Growth Fund invested 65% in Asian issuers. The Applicants do not believe that these differences are significant, particularly because of the lack of interest in the Pacific Growth Fund, as shown in its smaller size, and the more concentrated regional focus of the Pacific Growth Fund is likely to be a factor in its lower performance. The Applicants also considered that Owners likely invest in the Pacific Growth Fund as a means to diversify their assets into foreign equity securities. The International Fund will also enable Owners to achieve this diversification goal. Accordingly, Applicants believe that the International Fund is a suitable replacement for Owners to continue their investment in foreign equity securities.
6. Applicants state that the Insurance Company Applicants have specifically determined that the Substituting Fund is an approximate investment vehicle for Owners who have allocated value to the Replaced Fund and that the Substitution will be consistent with Owners' investment objectives.
7. Applicants assert that the fees and expenses of the Substituting Fund have historically been less than those of the Replaced Fund and, accordingly, that the proposed Substitution poses no concerns in connection with the fees and expenses that will arise therefrom.
8. Applicants assert that the Substituting Fund has significantly more assets than the Replaced Fund. It is expected that the lower expense ratios should continue as a result of the significantly greater assets of the Substituting Fund.
9. Applicants state that the returns of the Substituting Fund have consistently been substantially higher than the returns of Replaced Fund. While there is no guarantee that past performance will continue, Applicants state that the Substitution is not expected to give rise to diminution in performance or other adverse effects on Contract values.
10. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act defines the term “affiliated” person. The proposed Substitution will be effected in part through in-kind redemptions and purchases and may be deemed to entail the indirect purchase of shares of the related Substituting Fund with portfolio securities of the Replaced Fund, and the indirect sale of securities of the Replaced Fund for shares of the Substituting Fund.
11. In addition, the Insurance Company Applicants, as appropriate, will combine the subaccount investing in the Pacific Growth Fund and the continuing subaccount investing in the International Fund. Applicants state that the Insurance Company Applicants could be said to be transferring unit values between their respective subaccounts and that, the transfer of unit values could be said to involve purchase and sale transactions between subaccounts that are affiliated persons. Applicants further state that the sale and purchase transactions between subaccounts could be said to come within the scope of Section 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, respectively, and that the Substitution involving the combination of subaccounts may require an exemption from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act, pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.
12. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the commission may grant an Order exempting transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act upon application if evidence establishes that:
(a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve over-reaching on the part of any person concerned;
(b) The proposed transaction is consistent with the investment policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and
(c) The proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
The Applicants represent that the terms of the proposed transactions, as described in this Application, are: reasonable and fair, including the consideration to be paid and received; do not involve over-reaching; are consistent with the policies of the Replaced Fund of the Trust; and are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
13. Applicants represent that for all the reasons stated above with regard to Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act, the Substitution is reasonable and fair. It is expected that existing and future Owners will benefit from the consolidations of assets in the Substituting Fund. The transactions effecting the Substitution will be effected in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. Moreover, the partial in-kind redemptions of portfolio securities of the Replaced Fund will be effected in conformity with Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act and the procedures of the Trust established pursuant to Rule 17a-7. Applicants contend that the Owners' interests after the Substitution, in practical economic terms, will not differ in any measurable way from such interests immediately prior to the Substitution and that, in each case, the consideration to be received and paid is, therefore, reasonable and fair.
Applicants' Conclusions
Applicants submit, for all the reasons stated herein, that their requests meet the standards set out in Sections 6(c), 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act and that Start Printed Page 14607an Order should, therefore, be granted. Accordingly, Applicants request an Order pursuant to Sections 6(c), 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act approving the substitution of shares of the Pacific Growth Fund with shares of the International Fund.

PROFILE OF THE VALUEMARK IV VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT 
December 27, 1996

This Profile is a summary of some of the more  important  points that you should
consider and know before  purchasing the Valuemark IV Variable  Annuity Contract
with a fixed  account  option.  The  Contract  is more  fully  described  in the
prospectus which accompanies this Profile. Please read the prospectus carefully.

1. THE VALUEMARK IV VARIABLE  ANNUITY  CONTRACT.  The variable  annuity contract
with a fixed account option  offered by Allianz Life is a contract  between you,
the owner,  and Allianz Life Insurance  Company of North  America,  an insurance
company.  The Contract provides a means for investing on a tax-deferred basis in
23 funds of Franklin  Valuemark  Funds,  a series fund,  and a fixed  account of
Allianz Life. The Contract is intended for retirement savings or other long-term
investment  purposes  and provides for a death  benefit and  guaranteed  annuity
income options.                                                                 

The Contract has 24 investment options.  There are 23 funds which are managed by
professional  money  managers.  A list of the  available  funds is  contained in
Section 4. Depending upon market  conditions,  you can make or lose money in the
funds.                                                                          

The fixed  account  offers an interest  rate that is guaranteed by Allianz Life.
The interest  rate is set monthly and is  guaranteed  for 12 months.  While your
money is in the fixed account, the interest your money will earn as well as your
principal is guaranteed by Allianz Life.                                        

Allianz  Life  reserves  the  right to limit the  number of funds  which you may
invest in at any one time (now or in the  future).  Currently,  you can put your
money in 10  investment  options  (which  includes any of the 23 funds listed in
Section 4 and the Allianz Life fixed account).                                  

Like  all  deferred  annuity  contracts,  your  Contract  has  two  phases:  the
accumulation  phase and the income phase.  During the accumulation  phase,  your
earnings  accumulate  on a  tax-deferred  basis and are based on the  investment
performance  of the fund(s) you selected  and/or the interest rate earned on the
money you have in the fixed account. During the accumulation phase, the earnings
are taxed as income only when you make a  withdrawal.  The income  phase  occurs
when you begin receiving regular payments from your Contract.  The amount of the
payments you may receive during the income phase depends in part upon the amount
of money you are able to  accumulate in your  Contract  during the  accumulation
phase.                                                                          

2. ANNUITY PAYMENTS (THE INCOME PHASE). You can receive monthly annuity payments
from your  Contract by selecting one of the  following  annuity  options (all of
these options assume you are the owner and the annuitant): (1) payments for your
life; (2) payments for your life, but if you die before  payments have been made
for the guaranteed period you selected, payments will continue for the remainder
of the guaranteed  period (5,10, 15 or 20 years);  (3) payments during the joint
lifetime of you and the joint annuitant - when either of you die,  payments will
continue as long as the survivor  lives;  (4) payments during the joint lifetime
of you and the joint  annuitant,  but if you or the joint  annuitant  die before
payments have been made for the  guaranteed  period you selected,  payments will
continue for the remainder of the guaranteed period (5, 10, 15 or 20 years); and
(5)  payments  during your life  ending with the last  payment due prior to your
death with a  guarantee  that at your death  Allianz  Life will make a refund to
your beneficiary.  Once you begin receiving regular payments,  you cannot change
your annuity option or surrender your contract.                                 

During the income phase, you have the same investment choices you had during the
accumulation phase. You can choose to have payments come from the fixed account,
the funds or both. If you choose to have any part of your payments come from the
funds, the dollar amount of your annuity  payments may go up or down,  depending
on the investment performance.                                                  

3.  PURCHASE.    You  can  buy  the  Contract  with  $5,000 or more under most  
circumstances.  You  can  add  $250  or  more  any  time  you  like during the  
accumulation  phase.   You and the annuitant cannot be older than 85 years old  
at  the  time  you  buy  the  Contract.                                         

4.INVESTMENT OPTIONS.  You may invest in the Allianz Life fixed account or the  
following  funds  of  Franklin  Valuemark  Funds:

The funds are fully described in the attached  prospectus for Franklin Valuemark
Funds.  You  can  make  or  lose  money  in the  funds,  depending  upon  market
conditions.                                                                     

5.    EXPENSES.   The Contract has insurance features and investment features,  
and  there  are  costs  related  to  each.                                      

The annual  insurance  charges  total 1.49% of the  average  daily value of your
Contract allocated to the funds during the accumulation period (1.40% during the
income phase). Each year Allianz Life deducts a $30 contract  maintenance charge
from your Contract.  Allianz Life currently waives this charge if the cumulative
value  of all your  Valuemark  IV  Contracts  (registered  with the same  social
security  number) are at least  $50,000  (except in New Jersey).  There are also
annual fund charges which range from .40% to 1.41% of the average daily value of
the funds depending upon the fund(s) you invest in.                             

You can transfer between accounts up to 12 times a year without charge. After 12
transfers, the charge is $25 or 2% of the amount transferred, whichever is less.

If you make a withdrawal from the Contract, Allianz Life may assess a contingent
deferred sales charge (withdrawal charge). The amount of the charge depends upon
how long Allianz Life has had your payment. The charge is:                      

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                               
Number of  complete years from receipt   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7 or more 

Contingent Deferred Sales Charge                                               
(as a percentage of purchase payments)   6%  6%  6%  5%  4%  3%  2%          0%

Under  certain  circumstances,  after the first year, Allianz Life will permit  
you  to  access  your  money  in  the  Contract without deducting a contingent  
deferred  sales charge: 1) if you become confined to a nursing home; 2) if you  
become  terminally  ill;  or  3)  if  you  become  disabled.  Also, if you are  
unemployed  for  at  least  90  days, you can take up to 50% of your money out  
without incurring a contingent deferred sales charge. These options may not be  
available  in  all  states.                                                     

Allianz  Life will assess a state  premium tax charge  which  ranges from 0-3.5%
(depending  upon the state) when you die, start  receiving  annuity  payments or
make a complete withdrawal.                                                     

We have provided the following  chart to help you understand the charges in your
Contract.  The column "Total Annual Charges" shows the total of the $30 contract
maintenance  charge (which is  represented as .10% below),  the 1.49%  insurance
charges and the total  annual fund  charges for each fund.  The next two columns
show you two  examples  of the  charges,  in  dollars,  you  would  pay  under a
Contract. The examples assume that you invested $1,000 in a Contract which earns
5% annually and that you withdraw your money:  (1) at the end of year 1, and (2)
at the end of year 10. For year 1, the Total Annual Charges are assessed as well
as the contingent  deferred sales charge.  For year 10, the Total Annual Charges
are assessed but no contingent  deferred  sales charge is deducted.  The premium
tax is  assumed  to be 0% in both  examples.  These  are just  examples.  Future
expenses may be higher or lower than those shown.

The charges for the newly formed funds have been estimated. The charges for some
of the funds reflect expense  reimbursement and/or fee waiver arrangements.  For
more detailed information, see the Fee Table in the prospectus for the Contract.

6. TAXES. Your earnings are not taxed until you take them out. In most cases, if
you take money out,  earnings come out first and are taxed as income. If you are
younger  than 59 1/2 when you take money out,  you may be charged a 10%  federal
tax penalty on the taxable amounts  withdrawn.  Payments during the income phase
are considered  partly a return of your original  investment.  That part of each
payment is not taxable as income. If the Contract is  tax-qualified,  the entire
payment may be taxable.                                                         

7.  ACCESS TO YOUR  MONEY.  You may make a  withdrawal  at any time  during  the
accumulation  phase.  Any partial  withdrawal must be for at least $500. You may
request a  withdrawal  or elect the  Systematic  Withdrawal  Program  or Minimum
Distribution  Program which are briefly described in Section 10 of this Profile.
After the first year, you can make multiple  withdrawals up to a total of 15% of
the  value  of your  Contract  each  year  without  charge  from  Allianz  Life.
Withdrawals  in excess of that amount will be subject to a  contingent  deferred
sales  charge.  After  Allianz  Life has had a payment for 7 years,  there is no
charge for  withdrawals.  Each purchase payment you add to your Contract has its
own 7 year charge period.  Of course,  you may also have to pay income tax and a
tax penalty on any money you take out.                                          

8.  PERFORMANCE  OF THE FUNDS.  The value of the Contract will vary up or down  
depending  upon  the performance of the fund(s) you choose. From time to time,  
Allianz  Life may advertise total return figures for each fund. As of the date  
of  this  prospectus,  the  sale of the Contracts has not begun. Therefore, no  
performance  is  presented  here.                                               

9. DEATH BENEFIT.  If you die during the accumulation phase, the person you have
selected as your  beneficiary  will receive a death benefit.  This death benefit
will be the greater of: 1) the current value of your  Contract,  less any taxes,
on the day all claims proofs and payment  election forms are received by Allianz
Life at the Valuemark  Service  Center;  or 2) (if  applicable)  the  guaranteed
minimum death benefit,  less any taxes,  as of the day you die. During the first
year,  the  guaranteed  minimum  death benefit is equal to the payments you have
made,  less any money you have taken out and any  charges  paid on the money you
have  taken  out.  After the first  year and  before  your  76th  birthday,  the
guaranteed  minimum  death benefit as of the date of death is the greater of: A)
payments  you have made,  less any money you have taken out and charges  paid on
the  money  you  have  taken  out,  increased  by 5% per  year on each  Contract
anniversary; or B) the highest of the Contract values for each six year Contract
anniversary  determined by the Contract value on such six year  anniversary plus
any payments made, less any money taken out since that Contract anniversary, and
charges paid on the money you have taken out.  Different  rules will apply after
your 76th birthday.                                                             

10.    OTHER  INFORMATION.                                                      

     Free Look. If you cancel the Contract within 10 days after receiving it (or
whatever period is required in your state), we will send your money back without
assessing a contingent  deferred  sales charge.  You will receive  whatever your
Contract is worth on the day we receive your  request.  This may be more or less
than your original payment. (Some states require that we return your payment.)  

   No  Probate.   In most cases, when you die, your beneficiary will receive
the  death  benefit  without  going  through  probate.                          

     Who should  purchase  the  Contract?  The  Valuemark  IV  Variable  Annuity
Contract is designed for people seeking long-term  tax-deferred  accumulation of
assets,  generally for retirement or other long-term purposes.  The tax-deferred
feature is most attractive to people in high federal and state tax brackets. You
should not buy this  Contract if you are looking for a short-term  investment or
if you cannot accept the risk of getting back less money than you put in.       

   Additional  Features.   The Contract offers additional features which you
might  be  interested  in.  These  include:                                     

     Automatic Investment Plan - You can automatically add to your Contract on a
monthly or quarterly basis for as little as $100 by electronic transfer of funds
from your savings or checking account.                                          

      Dollar Cost  Averaging  Program - You can arrange to have a regular amount
of money automatically  transferred to selected funds each month,  theoretically
giving  you a lower  average  cost per unit  over  time  than a single  one time
purchase. However, there are no guarantees that this will take place.           

      Flexible Rebalancing - Allianz Life will automatically readjust your money
among the funds to maintain  your  specified  allocation  mix.  This can be done
quarterly, semi-annually or annually.                                           

      Systematic  Withdrawal  Program  - You can  elect to  receive  monthly  or
quarterly  payments from Allianz Life while your Contract is in the accumulation
phase. Of course, you may have to pay taxes on the money you receive.           

     Minimum  Distribution  Program - You can  arrange to have money sent to you
each month or quarter to meet certain required distribution requirements imposed
by the Internal Revenue Code.                                                   

These  features are not available in all states and may not be suitable for your
particular situation.

   1/ The Fund  Administration  Fee is a direct expense for the Templeton Global         
Asset Allocation Fund, the Templeton  International  Smaller Companies Fund, the         
Mutual Shares  Securities Fund and the Mutual  Discovery  Securities Fund; other         
funds pay for similar  services  indirectly  through the Management Fee. See the         
Franklin  Valuemark  Funds  prospectus for further  information  regarding these         
fees.                                                                                    

     2/ Franklin Advisers,  Inc. agreed to waive a portion of its Management Fee         
and to pay  certain  expenses  of the  Money  Market  Fund  during  1995.  It is         
currently   continuing  this  arrangement  in  1996.  This  arrangement  may  be         
terminated at any time.  With this  reduction,  the fund's total annual expenses         
for 1995 were 0.40% of the average daily net assets of the fund.                         

     3/  Prior  to  May 1, 1996, the Templeton Global Income Securities Fund was known as
the  Global  Income  Fund.                                                               

     4/ Although not obligated to, Franklin Advisers, Inc. has agreed to waive a         
portion of its  Management  Fees and to pay  certain  expenses of the three Zero         
Coupon Funds  through at least  December 31, 1996 so that the total  expenses of         
the Zero Coupon  Funds will not exceed  0.40% of each fund's net assets.  Absent         
the management fee waivers and expense payments, for the year ended December 31,
1995,  the Total Annual  Expenses and Management  and Fund  Administration  Fees         
would have been as follows:  Zero Coupon  Fund-2000,  .63% and .60%; Zero Coupon         
Fund-2005, .66% and .63%; and Zero Coupon Fund- 2010, .66% and .63%.                     

     5/ The Templeton  Global Asset  Allocation Fund began  operations on May 1,
1995;  the Small Cap Fund began  operations  on  November  1, 1995;  the Capital         
Growth and Templeton  International  Smaller Companies Funds began operations on         
May 1, 1996; and the Mutual Shares  Securities and Mutual  Discovery  Securities         
Funds began  operations on November 8, 1996.  The expenses shown above for these         
funds are therefore estimated for 1996.                                                  

</FN>                                                                                    

The  purpose  of this  Fee  Table  is to show you the  expenses  you will  incur
directly or indirectly with the contract. The Fee Table reflects expenses of the
Separate  Account  as  well as the  funds.  The  examples  below  should  not be
considered a representation  of past or future expenses.  Actual expenses may be
greater  or less  than  those  shown.  The $30  contract  maintenance  charge is
included in the Examples as a prorated charge of $1. Since the average  contract
account size is greater than $1,000, the contract  maintenance charge is reduced
accordingly.  Premium taxes are not  reflected in the tables.  Premium taxes may
apply.  For  additional  information,  see Section 5 - Expenses and the Franklin
Valuemark Funds prospectus.

You will pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment, assuming a 5% annual
return on your  money if you  surrender  your  Contract  at the end of each time
period:

1. THE  VALUEMARK  IV  VARIABLE  ANNUITY  CONTRACT 

This  prospectus  describes a variable  annuity  contract  with a fixed  account
option offered by Allianz Life.                                                 

An annuity is a contract  between you, the owner,  and an insurance  company (in
this case Allianz  Life),  where the insurance  company  promises to pay you (or
someone else you choose) an income, in the form of annuity  payments,  beginning
on a designated date that is at least two years in the future.  Until you decide
to begin receiving annuity payments,  your annuity is in the accumulation phase.
Once you begin receiving annuity payments,  your contract switches to the income
phase. The contract benefits from tax deferral.                                 

Tax  deferral  means that you are not taxed on earnings or  appreciation  on the
assets in your contract until you take money out of your contract.              

The contract is called a variable annuity because you can choose among 23 funds.
Depending  upon  market  conditions,  you can make or lose money in any of these
funds. If you select the variable annuity portion of the contract, the amount of
money you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation  phase
depends in part upon the investment  performance of the fund(s) you select.  The
amount of the  annuity  payments  you receive  during the income  phase from the
variable  annuity  portion of the  contract  also  depends  upon the  investment
performance of the funds you select for the income phase.                       

The contract also contains a fixed account. The fixed account offers an interest
rate that is guaranteed  for all deposits made within the twelve month period by
Allianz Life. This interest rate is set monthly and is guaranteed for 12 months.
Allianz Life guarantees that the interest credited to the fixed account will not
be less than 3% per year.  If you select the fixed  account,  your money will be
placed with the other  general  assets of Allianz  Life. If you select the fixed
account,  the amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract during
the  accumulation  phase  depends  upon  the  total  interest  credited  to your
contract.                                                                       

We will not make any changes to your contract without your permission  except as
may be required by law.                                                         

CONTRACT  OWNER . You,  as the  contract  owner,  have all the rights  under the
contract.  The  contract  owner is as  designated  at the time the  contract  is
issued,  unless changed. You may change contract owners at any time. This may be
a taxable event. You should consult with your tax adviser before doing this.    

JOINT OWNER . The contract can be owned by joint owners. Any joint owner must be
the spouse of the other contract owner (except in Pennsylvania and Oregon). Upon
the death of either joint owner,  the  surviving  spouse will be the  designated
beneficiary.  Any other  beneficiary  designation  at the time the  contract was
issued  or as may have  been  later  changed  will be  treated  as a  contingent
beneficiary unless otherwise indicated.                                         

ANNUITANT  . You name an  annuitant.  You may change the  annuitant  at any time
before the income date unless the  contract  is owned by a  non-individual  (for
example, a corporation).                                                        

BENEFICIARY 

The  beneficiary  is the  person(s)  or  entity  you name to  receive  any death
benefit.  The  beneficiary  is named at the time the  contract is issued  unless
changed at a later date.  Unless an irrevocable  beneficiary has been named, you
can change the beneficiary or contingent beneficiary.                           

ASSIGNMENT                                                                      

You can assign the contract at any time during your lifetime.  Allianz Life will
not be bound by the  assignment  until it  receives  the  written  notice of the
assignment.  Allianz  Life will not be liable for any payment or other action we
take in accordance with the contract before we receive notice of the assignment.
Any assignment  made after the death benefit has become payable can only be done
with our consent. AN ASSIGNMENT MAY BE A TAXABLE EVENT.                         

If the contract is issued pursuant to a qualified plan, there may be limitations
on your ability to assign the contract.                                         

2.    ANNUITY  PAYMENTS  (THE  INCOME  PHASE)                                   

You can receive  regular  monthly income  payments under your contract.  You can
choose the month and year in which those payments  begin.  We call that date the
income date. Your income date must be the first day of a calendar month and must
be at least 2 years after you buy the contract. You can also choose among income
plans. We call those annuity options.                                           

We ask you to choose your income date when you  purchase the  contract.  You can
change it at any time before the income date with 30 days notice to us.  Annuity
payments must begin by the  annuitant's  85th birthday or 10 years from the date
the contract was issued,  whichever is later.  The annuitant is the person whose
life we look to when we make annuity  payments.  You (or someone you  designate)
will  receive the annuity  payments.  You will  receive tax  reporting  on those
payments.                                                                       

If you do not choose an annuity  option prior to the income date, we will assume
that  you  selected  Option 2 which  provides  a life  annuity  with 10 years of
guaranteed payments.                                                            

You may elect to receive your  annuity  payments as a variable  payout,  a fixed
payout,  or a  combination  of both.  Under a fixed  payout,  all of the annuity
payments will be the same dollar amount (equal  installments).  Under a variable
payout,  you have the same investment choices from the funds that were available
during the  accumulation  phase.  If you do not tell us otherwise,  your annuity
payments will be based on the investment  allocations  that were in place on the
income date.                                                                    

If you  choose  to have any  portion  of your  annuity  payments  come  from the
fund(s), the dollar amount of your payment will depend upon three things: 1) the
value of your  contract  in the  fund(s) on the income  date,  2) the 5% assumed
investment  rate  used  in  the  annuity  table  for  the  contract,  and 3) the
performance of the fund(s) you selected.  If the actual performance  exceeds the
5% assumed rate, your annuity payments will increase.  Similarly,  if the actual
rate is less than 5%, your annuity payments will decrease.                      

ANNUITY  OPTIONS 

You can choose one of the following  annuity options or any other annuity option
you want and that Allianz Life agrees to provide.  After annuity payments begin,
you cannot change the annuity option.                                           

OPTION  1.  LIFE  ANNUITY.  Under  this  option,  we will make monthly annuity  
payments  so long as the annuitant is alive. After the annuitant dies, we stop  
making  annuity  payments.                                                      

OPTION 2. LIFE ANNUITY WITH 5, 10, 15 or 20 YEAR PAYMENTS GUARANTEED. Under this
option, we will make monthly annuity payments so long as the annuitant is alive.
However,  if, when the annuitant  dies,  we have made annuity  payments for less
than the selected  guaranteed  period, we will continue to make annuity payments
to you for the rest of the  guaranteed  period.  If you do not  want to  receive
annuity payments, you can ask us for a single lump sum.                         

OPTION 3.  JOINT AND LAST  SURVIVOR  ANNUITY.  Under this  option,  we will make
monthly  annuity  payments  during the joint  lifetime of the  annuitant and the
joint annuitant. When the annuitant dies, if the joint annuitant is still alive,
we will  continue  to make  annuity  payments,  so long as the  joint  annuitant
continues  to live.  The  amount  of the  annuity  payments  we will make to the
survivor can be equal to 100%,  75% or 50% of the amount that we would have paid
if they both were alive.  The monthly  annuity  payments  will end when the last
surviving annuitant dies.                                                       

OPTION 4. JOINT AND LAST  SURVIVOR  ANNUITY  WITH 5, 10, 15 or 20 YEAR  PAYMENTS
GUARANTEED.  Under this option, we will make monthly annuity payments during the
joint  lifetime of the  annuitant  and the joint  annuitant.  When the annuitant
dies,  if the joint  annuitant is still alive,  we will continue to make annuity
payments,  so long as the surviving  annuitant continues to live, at 100% of the
amount  that would  have been paid if they were both  alive.  If,  when the last
death  occurs,  we have  made  annuity  payments  for  less  than  the  selected
guaranteed  period,  we will  continue  to make  annuity  payments to you or any
person you designate for rest of the  guaranteed  period.  If you do not want to
receive annuity payments, you can ask us for a single lump sum.                 

OPTION 5. REFUND LIFE ANNUITY.  Under this option,  we will make monthly annuity
payments during the annuitant's lifetime.  The last annuity payment will be made
before the  annuitant  dies with a guarantee  that  Allianz  Life will pay you a
refund.                                                                         

3.  PURCHASE                                                                    

PURCHASE  PAYMENTS 

A purchase payment is the money you invest in the contract.  The minimum payment
Allianz   Life  will  accept  is  $5,000  when  the  contract  is  bought  as  a
non-qualified contract. If you enroll in the Automatic Investment Plan (which is
described  below),  your purchase  payment can be $2,000.  If you are buying the
contract  as part of an IRA  (Individual  Retirement  Annuity),  401(k) or other
qualified plan, the minimum amount we will accept is $2,000. The maximum we will
accept  without  our  prior  approval  is $1  million.  You can make  additional
purchase  payments of $250 (or as low as $100 if you have selected the Automatic
Investment  Plan) or more to either  type of  contract.  At the time you buy the
contract, you and the annuitant cannot be older than 85 years old.              

AUTOMATIC  INVESTMENT  PLAN                                                     

The  Automatic  Investment  Plan  (AIP) is a program  which  allows  you to make
additional purchase payments to your contract on a monthly or quarterly basis by
electronic  transfer  of funds from your  savings or checking  account.  You may
participate in this program by completing the appropriate  form. We must receive
your form by the first of the month in order for AIP to begin  that same  month.
Investments  will take place on the 20th of the month, or the next business day.
The minimum  investment that can be made by AIP is $100. You may stop AIP at any
time you want. We need to be notified by the first of the month in order to stop
or change AIP that month.  If AIP is used for a qualified  contract,  you should
consult your tax adviser for advice regarding maximum contributions.            

ALLOCATION  OF  PURCHASE  PAYMENTS                                              

When you purchase a contract,  we will  allocate  your  purchase  payment to the
fixed account and/or one or more of the funds you have selected. We ask that you
allocate  your money in either whole  percentages  or round  dollars.  The fixed
account  may  not be  available  in  your  state  (check  with  your  registered
representative).  You  can  instruct  us how  to  allocate  additional  purchase
payments you make.  If you do not instruct us, we will allocate them in the same
way as your  previous  instructions  to us.  Allianz Life  reserves the right to
limit the number of funds that you may invest in at one time. Currently, you may
invest in 10 investment  options at one time (which includes any of the 23 funds
of  Franklin  Valuemark  Funds  listed in Section 4 and the  Allianz  Life fixed
account). We may change this in the future. However, we will always allow you to
invest in at least five funds.                                                  

Once we receive your purchase  payment,  the necessary  information  and federal
funds (federal funds means monies credited to a bank's account with its regional
federal  reserve  bank),  we will issue your  contract and  allocate  your first
purchase  payment  within  2  business  days.  If you do not  give us all of the
information  we need,  we will  contact you to get it. If for some reason we are
unable to complete this process within 5 business days, we will either send back
your money or get your  permission  to keep it until we get all of the necessary
information.  If you make  additional  purchase  payments,  we will credit these
amounts to your  contract  within one business day. Our business day closes when
the New York Stock Exchange closes, which is usually at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.

If you change your mind about owning the  contract,  you can cancel it within 10
days after receiving it (or the period required in your state).  When you cancel
the contract within this time period,  Allianz Life will not assess a contingent
deferred sales charge.  You will receive back whatever your contract is worth on
the day we receive your request.  In certain states or if you have purchased the
contract as an IRA, we may be required to give you back your purchase payment if
you  decide to  cancel  your  contract  within 10 days  after  receiving  it (or
whatever period is required in your state).  If that is the case, we reserve the
right to put your purchase payment in the Money Market Fund for 15 days after we
issue your contract.  (In some states,  the period may be longer.) At the end of
that  period,  we will  re-allocate  those  funds  as you  selected.  Currently,
however,  we will  directly  allocate  your money to the funds  and/or the fixed
account as you have selected.                                                   

ACCUMULATION  UNITS 

The value of the portion of your  contract  allocated to the funds will go up or
down depending upon the  investment  performance of the fund(s) you choose.  The
value of your  contract  will also depend on the  expenses of the  contract.  In
order to keep track of the value of your contract,  we use a measurement  called
an accumulation unit (which is like a share of a mutual fund). During the income
phase of the contract we call it an annuity unit.                               

Every business day we determine the value of an accumulation  unit for a fund by
multiplying the accumulation  unit value for the previous period by a factor for
each fund for the current period. The factor for each fund is determined by:    

   1.    dividing the value of a fund share at the end of the current period
by  the  value  of  a  fund  share  for  the  previous  period;  and            

   2.  multiplying it by one minus the daily amount of the insurance charges
and  any  charges  for  taxes.                                                  

The value of an accumulation unit may go up or down from day to day.            

When you make a purchase  payment,  we credit your  contract  with  accumulation
units.  The number of accumulation  units credited is determined by dividing the
amount  of the  purchase  payment  allocated  to a  fund  by  the  value  of the
accumulation unit for that fund.                                                

We calculate the value of an accumulation  unit for each fund after the New York
Stock Exchange closes each day and then credit your contract.                   

EXAMPLE:                                                                        

On Wednesday we receive an additional  purchase  payment of $3,000 from you. You
have told us you want this to go to the  Growth and  Income  Fund.  When the New
York Stock Exchange closes on that Wednesday,  we determine that the value of an
accumulation  unit for the  Growth and Income  Fund is  $12.50.  We then  divide
$3,000  by  $12.50  and  credit  your  contract  on  Wednesday  night  with  240
accumulation units for the Growth and Income Fund.                              

4.  INVESTMENT  OPTIONS

TRANSFERS                                                                       

You can transfer money among the 23 funds and/or the fixed account. Allianz Life
currently allows you to make as many transfers as you want to each year. Allianz
Life may change  this  practice  in the  future.  However,  this  product is not
designed for professional market timing organizations or other individuals using
programmed and frequent transfers. Such activity may be disruptive to a fund. We
reserve the right to stop or prohibit  these types of  transfers if we determine
that they could harm a fund.                                                    

Your contract  provides that you can make 3 transfers every year without charge.
However,  currently  Allianz Life  permits you to make 12  transfers  every year
without charge. We measure a year from the anniversary of the day we issued your
contract.  You can make a transfer  to or from the fixed  account and to or from
any fund. If you make more than 12 transfers in a year,  there is a transfer fee
deducted. The fee is $25 per transfer or, if less, 2% of the amount transferred.
The following applies to any transfer:                                          

     1. The minimum amount which you can transfer is $1,000 ($500 in New Jersey)
or your entire value in the fund or fixed account. This requirement is waived if
the transfer is in connection with the Dollar Cost Averaging Program or Flexible
Rebalancing (which are described below).                                        

   2.  We  may  not allow you to make transfers during the free look period.

   3.  Your  request  for a transfer must clearly state which fund(s) or the
fixed  account  is  involved  in  the  transfer.                                

   4.  Your  request for a transfer must clearly state how much the transfer
is  for.                                                                        

     5. You cannot make any  transfers  within 7 calendar days prior to the date
your first annuity payment is due.                                              

   6.    During  the  income phase, you may not make a transfer from a fixed
annuity  option  to  a  variable  annuity  option.                              

     7.  During  the income  phase,  you can make at least one  transfer  from a
variable annuity option to a fixed annuity option.                              

Allianz Life has reserved the right to modify the transfer provisions subject to
the guarantees described above.                                                 

You can make transfers by telephone.  We may allow you to authorize someone else
to make  transfers by telephone on your behalf.  If you own the contract  with a
joint owner,  unless  Allianz Life is  instructed  otherwise,  Allianz Life will
accept  instructions  from either one of you.  Allianz Life will use  reasonable
procedures to confirm that instructions given us by telephone are genuine. If we
do not use such procedures,  we may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized
or   fraudulent   instructions.   Allianz  Life  tape   records  all   telephone
instructions.                                                                   

DOLLAR  COST  AVERAGING  PROGRAM                                                

The Dollar Cost Averaging  Program allows you to  systematically  transfer a set
amount of money each month or quarter from any one fund or the fixed  account to
up to eight of the other funds. By allocating  amounts on a regularly  scheduled
basis, as opposed to allocating the total amount at one particular time, you may
be  less  susceptible  to the  impact  of  market  fluctuations.  You  may  only
participate in this program during the accumulation phase.                      

You must  participate  in the program for at least six months (or two  quarters)
and must  transfer  at least  $500  each time (or  $1,500  each  quarter).  Your
allocations  can be in whole  percentages  or dollar  amounts.  The  fund(s) you
transfer  from may not be the fund(s) you transfer to in this  program.  You may
elect this  program by  properly  completing  the Dollar  Cost  Averaging  forms
provided by Allianz Life.                                                       

All Dollar Cost  Averaging  transfers  will be made on the 10th day of the month
unless that day is not a business  day. If it is not,  then the transfer will be
made the next business day.                                                     

Your participation in the program will end when any of the following occurs: (1)
the number of desired transfers have been made; (2) you do not have enough money
in the  fund(s)  or  fixed  account  to make  the  transfer  (if  less  money is
available,  that amount will be dollar cost  averaged and the program will end);
(3) you request to terminate the program (your request must be received by us by
the first of the month to terminate that month); (4) the contract is terminated;
or (5) we receive proof of the Contract Owner's death.                          

If you  participate  in the Dollar Cost  Averaging  Program,  the transfers made
under the program are not taken into account in  determining  any transfer  fee.
You may not  participate  in the Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  and  Flexible
Rebalancing at the same time.                                                   

FLEXIBLE  REBALANCING                                                           

Once your money has been invested, the performance of the funds and the earnings
from the fixed account may cause your allocation to shift.  Flexible Rebalancing
is designed  to help you  maintain  your  specified  allocation  mix between the
different  funds.  You can  direct us to  readjust  your  money on a  quarterly,
semi-annual  or annual basis to return to your  original  allocations.  Flexible
Rebalancing  transfers will be made on the 20th day of the month unless that day
is not a  business  day.  If it is not,  then the  transfer  will be made on the
previous  day. If you  participate  in the  Flexible  Rebalancing  Program,  the
transfers made under the program are not taken into account in  determining  any
transfer  fee.  The  fixed  account  is not  permitted  to be part  of  Flexible
Rebalancing.                                                                    

VOTING  RIGHTS                                                                  

Allianz  Life is the  legal  owner of the fund  shares.  However,  Allianz  Life
believes that when a fund  solicits  proxies in  conjunction  with a shareholder
vote, it is required to obtain from you and other contract  owners  instructions
as to how to vote those shares. When we receive those instructions, we will vote
all of the shares we own in  proportion  to those  instructions.  This will also
include any shares that Allianz Life owns on its own behalf. Should Allianz Life
determine that it is no longer  required to comply with the above,  we will vote
the shares in our own right.                                                    

SUBSTITUTION                                                                    

Allianz Life may be required to  substitute  one of the funds you have  selected
with  another  fund.  We would not do this  without  the prior  approval  of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  We will give you notice of our intention to
do this.                                                                        

5.  EXPENSES                                                                    

There are charges and other  expenses  associated  with the  contract  that will
reduce your investment return. These charges and expenses are:                  

INSURANCE  CHARGES                                                              

Each  day,  Allianz  Life makes a deduction for its insurance charges. Allianz  
Life  does  this  as  part of its calculation of the value of the accumulation  
units  and  the  annuity  units.  The  insurance  charge has two parts: 1) the  
mortality  and  expense  risk  charge  and  2)  the  administrative  charge.    

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE . During the accumulation  phase,  this charge
is  equal,  on an  annual  basis,  to 1.34% of the  average  daily  value of the
contract invested in a fund, after the deduction of expenses.  During the income
phase,  the charge is equal,  on an annual basis,  to 1.25% of the average daily
value of the contract invested in a fund, after the deduction of expenses.  This
charge  compensates us for all the insurance  benefits provided by your contract
(for  example,  the  guarantee of annuity  rates,  the death  benefits,  certain
expenses related to the contract,  and for assuming the risk (expense risk) that
the  current  charges  will be  insufficient  in the future to cover the cost of
administering the contract). The amount of the mortality and expense risk charge
is less  during  the  income  phase  because  Allianz  Life does not pay a death
benefit if you die during the income  phase.  If this charge is not  sufficient,
then Allianz  Life will bear the loss.  Allianz  Life does,  however,  expect to
profit  from this  charge.  The  mortality  and expense  risk  charge  cannot be
increased. Allianz Life may use any profits it makes from this charge to pay for
the costs of distributing the contract.                                         

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE . This charge is equal, on an annual basis, to .15% of the
average daily value of the contract  invested in a fund,  after the deduction of
expenses.  This charge,  together with the contract maintenance charge (which is
explained below), is for all the expenses  associated with the administration of
the  contract.  Some of these  expenses  include:  preparation  of the contract,
confirmations,  annual reports and statements,  maintenance of contract records,
personnel  costs,  legal and  accounting  fees,  filing  fees,  and computer and
systems costs. Because this charge is taken out of every unit value, you may pay
more in  administrative  costs than those that are  associated  solely with your
contract.  Allianz Life does not intend to profit from this charge.  However, if
this  charge  and the  contract  maintenance  charge are not enough to cover the
costs of the contracts in the future, Allianz Life will bear the loss.          

CONTRACT  MAINTENANCE  CHARGE                                                   

Every year on the anniversary of the date when your contract was issued, Allianz
Life  deducts $30 from your  contract  as a contract  maintenance  charge.  This
charge is for  administrative  expenses  (see  above).  This  charge  can not be
increased.                                                                      

However,  during the  accumulation  phase,  if the value of your  contract is at
least $50,000 when the deduction for the charge is to be made, Allianz Life will
not deduct this charge. If you own more than one Valuemark IV contract,  Allianz
Life will determine the total value of all your contracts. If the total value of
all  contracts  registered  under the same  social  security  number is at least
$50,000, Allianz Life will not assess the contract maintenance charge (except in
New  Jersey).  If the  contract  is  owned  by a  non-natural  person  (e.g.,  a
corporation),  Allianz  Life will look to the  annuitant to determine if it will
assess the charge.                                                              

If you make a complete withdrawal from your contract,  the contract  maintenance
charge  will also be  deducted.  During the  income  phase,  the charge  will be
collected monthly out of each annuity payment.                                  

CONTINGENT  DEFERRED  SALES  CHARGE                                             

Withdrawals  may be subject to a contingent  deferred  sales charge.  During the
accumulation  phase, you can make  withdrawals from your contract.  Allianz Life
keeps  track of each  purchase  payment you make.  The amount of the  contingent
deferred sales charge depends upon how long Allianz Life has had your payment.  
The  charge  is:                                                                

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                         
Number of complete years from                                            
   receipt of payment:         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7 or more     
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge:  6%  6%  6%  5%  4%  3%  2%          0%

However,  after Allianz Life has had a purchase payment for 7 years, there is no
charge when you withdraw that purchase  payment.  For purposes of the contingent
deferred sales charge, Allianz Life treats withdrawals as coming from the oldest
purchase  payments first.  Allianz Life does not assess the contingent  deferred
sales charge on any payments paid out as annuity payments or as death benefits. 

NOTE:  For tax purposes, withdrawals are considered to have come from the last  
money  you  put  into  the  contract.  Thus,  for  tax  purposes, earnings are  
considered  to  come  out  first.                                               

Free  Withdrawal  Amount - Each year after the first contract year, you can make
multiple  withdrawals  up to 15% of the value of your contract and no contingent
deferred sales charge will be deducted from the 15% you take out. Withdrawals in
excess of that free  amount  will be subject to the  contingent  deferred  sales
charge.                                                                         

You may also select to  participate  in the  Systematic  Withdrawal             
Program or the Minimum  Distribution  Program which allow you to withdraw  money
without the  deduction of the  contingent  deferred  sales charge under  certain
circumstances.  See  Section 7 - Access to Your Money for a  description  of the
Systematic  Withdrawal Program and the Minimum Distribution Program.            

WAIVER OF CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE BENEFITS                             

Under certain circumstances,  after the first year, Allianz Life will permit you
to take your money out of the contract without  deducting a contingent  deferred
sales  charge:  1) if you become  confined to a nursing  home;  2) if you become
terminally ill, which is defined as life expectancy of 12 months or less (a full
surrender  of the  contract  will  be  required);  or 3) if you  become  totally
disabled for at least 90 days.                                                  

Also,  after the first year, if you become  unemployed for at least 90 days, you
can take up to 50% of your money out  without  incurring a  contingent  deferred
sales  charge.  This  benefit  is  available  only once  during  the life of the
contract  and you may not use both  this  benefit  and the 15%  free  withdrawal
amount in the same contract year.                                               

These benefits may not be available in your state.                              

REDUCTION  OR  ELIMINATION  OF  THE  CONTINGENT  DEFERRED  SALES  CHARGE        

Allianz  Life will reduce or  eliminate  the amount of the  contingent  deferred
sales  charge when the  contract is sold under  circumstances  which  reduce its
sales expenses. Some examples are: if there is a large group of individuals that
will be  purchasing  the  contract  or a  prospective  purchaser  already  had a
relationship  with  Allianz  Life.  Allianz  Life will not  deduct a  contingent
deferred  sales  charge  under a  contract  issued to an  officer,  director  or
employee of Allianz Life or any of its affiliates.  Also,  Allianz Life will not
deduct a contingent deferred sales charge when a contract is sold by an agent of
Allianz Life to any members of his or her immediate family and the commission is
reduced.  Any  circumstances  resulting  in  reduction  or  elimination  of  the
contingent deferred sales charge requires prior approval of Allianz Life.       

TRANSFER  FEE                                                                   

You can make 12 free  transfers  every  year.  We measure a year from the day we
issue your contract. If you make more than 12 transfers a year, we will deduct a
transfer fee of $25 or 2% of the amount that is transferred,  whichever is less,
for each additional transfer.                                                   

If the  transfer  is part of the  Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  or  Flexible
Rebalancing, it will not count in determining the transfer fee.                 

PREMIUM  TAXES                                                                  

Some  states  and other  governmental  entities  (e.g.,  municipalities)  charge
premium taxes or similar taxes.  Allianz Life is responsible  for the payment of
these taxes and will make a deduction  from the value of the  contract for them.
Some of these  taxes are due when the  contract  is issued,  others are due when
annuity  payments begin. It is Allianz Life's current practice to not charge you
for these taxes until you die, annuity  payments begin or a complete  withdrawal
is made.  Allianz Life may some time in the future discontinue this practice and
assess the charge when the tax is due.  Premium taxes generally range from 0% to
3.5%, depending on the state.                                                   

INCOME  TAXES                                                                   

Allianz  Life will deduct from the  contract  for any income  taxes which it may
incur  because of the contract.  Currently,  Allianz Life is not making any such
deductions.                                                                     

FUND  EXPENSES                                                                  

There are  deductions  from and  expenses  paid out of the assets of the various
funds which are  described in the  attached  prospectus  for Franklin  Valuemark
Funds.                                                                          

6.  TAXES                                                                       

NOTE: Allianz Life has prepared the following  information on taxes as a general
discussion of the subject.  It is not intended as tax advice. You should consult
your own tax adviser  about your own  circumstances.  Allianz  Life has included
additional   information   regarding   taxes  in  the  Statement  of  Additional
Information.                                                                    

ANNUITY  CONTRACTS  IN  GENERAL                                                 

Annuity  contracts  are a means of setting  aside money for future needs usually
retirement.  Congress  recognized  how important  saving for  retirement was and
provided special rules in the Internal Revenue Code (Code) for annuities.       

Basically, these rules provide that you will not be taxed on the earnings on the
money  held in your  annuity  contract  until  you take the money  out.  This is
referred to as tax deferral. There are different rules regarding how you will be
taxed  depending  upon  how you  take the  money  out and the  type of  contract
qualified or non-qualified (see following sections).                            

You, as the owner,  will not be taxed on increases in the value of your contract
until a  distribution  occurs - either as a withdrawal  or as annuity  payments.
When you make a withdrawal you are taxed on the amount of the withdrawal that is
earnings. For annuity payments, different rules apply. A portion of each annuity
payment  you  receive  will be  treated  as a partial  return  of your  purchase
payments and will not be taxed.  The  remaining  portion of the annuity  payment
will be treated as ordinary  income.  How the annuity payment is divided between
taxable and non-taxable  portions depends upon the period over which the annuity
payments  are  expected to be made.  Annuity  payments  received  after you have
received all of your purchase payments are fully includible in income.          

When a  non-qualified  contract  is  owned  by a  non-natural  person  (e.g.,  a
corporation  or certain other  entities other than  tax-qualified  trusts),  the
contract  will  generally  not be treated as an annuity for tax  purposes.  This
means that the contract may not receive the benefits of tax-deferral. Income may
be taxed as ordinary income every year.                                         

QUALIFIED  AND  NON-QUALIFIED  CONTRACTS 

If you purchase the contract under a qualified  plan,  your contract is referred
to  as a  qualified  contract.  Examples  of  qualified  plans  are:  Individual
Retirement Annuities (IRAs),  Tax-Sheltered  Annuities (sometimes referred to as
403(b)  contracts),  H.R. 10 Plans (sometimes  referred to as Keogh Plans),  and
pension and profit-sharing plans, which include 401(k) plans.                   

If you do not purchase the contract  under a qualified  plan,  your  contract is
referred to as a non-qualified contract.                                        

WITHDRAWALS  -  NON-QUALIFIED  CONTRACTS 

If you make a withdrawal  from your contract,  the Code treats such a withdrawal
as first coming from  earnings  and then from your  purchase  payments.  In most
cases, such withdrawn earnings are includible in income.                        

The Code also provides that any amount received under an annuity  contract which
is included in income may be subject to a tax penalty. The amount of the penalty
is equal to 10% of the amount that is  includible  in income.  Some  withdrawals
will be exempt from the penalty.  They include any amounts: (1) paid on or after
the  taxpayer  reaches  age 59 1/2;  (2) paid  after  you  die;  (3) paid if the
taxpayer  becomes  totally  disabled (as that term is defined in the Code);  (4)
paid in a  series  of  substantially  equal  payments  made  annually  (or  more
frequently) for the life or life  expectancy of the taxpayer;  (5) paid under an
immediate annuity; or (6) which come from purchase payments made prior to August
14, 1982.                                                                       

WITHDRAWALS  -  QUALIFIED  CONTRACTS 

The above  information  describing the taxation of non-qualified  contracts does
not apply to qualified contracts.  There are special rules that govern qualified
contracts. A more complete discussion of withdrawals from qualified contracts is
contained in the Statement of Additional Information.                           

WITHDRAWALS  -  TAX-SHELTERED  ANNUITIES                                        

The Code limits the withdrawal of purchase  payments made by owners from certain
Tax-Sheltered Annuities. Withdrawals can only be made when a Contract Owner: (1)
reaches age 59-1/2;  (2) leaves his/her job; (3) dies; (4) becomes  disabled (as
that term is defined in the Code); or (5) in the case of hardship.  However,  in
the case of hardship, the Contract Owner can only withdraw the purchase payments
and not any earnings.                                                           

DIVERSIFICATION                                                                 

The Code provides that the underlying  investments  for a variable  annuity must
satisfy  certain  diversification  requirements  in  order to be  treated  as an
annuity  contract.  Allianz Life believes that the funds are being managed so as
to comply with the  requirements.                                               

Neither the Code nor the Internal  Revenue  Service  Regulations  issued to date
provide guidance as to the circumstances  under which you, because of the degree
of control you exercise over the  underlying  investments,  and not Allianz Life
would be  considered  the owner of the shares of the funds.  If this occurs,  it
will result in the loss of the favorable  tax treatment for the contract.  It is
unknown to what extent under  federal tax law Contract  Owners are  permitted to
select funds,  to make transfers among the funds or the number and type of funds
Contract Owners may select from. If any guidance is provided which is considered
a new  position,  then the guidance  would  generally be applied  prospectively.
However,  if such  guidance is considered  not to be a new  position,  it may be
applied  retroactively.  This would mean that you, as the owner of the contract,
could be treated as the owner of the funds.                                     

Due to the uncertainty in this area,  Allianz Life reserves the                 
right to modify the contract in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment. 

7.  ACCESS  TO  YOUR  MONEY                                                     

You can have access to the money in your  contract:  (1) by making a  withdrawal
(either a partial or a total withdrawal);  (2) by receiving annuity payments; or
(3) when a death benefit is paid to your  beneficiary.  Withdrawals  can only be
made during the accumulation phase.                                             

When you make a complete  withdrawal  you will receive the value of the contract
on the day you made the withdrawal less any applicable contingent deferred sales
charge,  less any premium tax and less any  contract  maintenance  charge.  (See
Section 5 - Expenses for a discussion of the charges.)                          

Any  partial  withdrawal  must be for at least  $500 and,  unless  you  instruct
Allianz Life  otherwise,  and will be made  pro-rata  from all the funds and the
fixed account you selected.  Allianz Life requires that after you make a partial
withdrawal the value of your contract must be at least $2,000.                  

INCOME TAXES, TAX PENALTIES AND CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS MAY APPLY TO ANY WITHDRAWAL
YOU MAKE.                                                                       

There are limits to the amount you can withdraw  from a qualified  plan referred
to as a 403(b) plan. For a more complete explanation see Section 6 - Taxes    
and  the  discussion  in  the  SAI.                                             

SYSTEMATIC  WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM                                                  

If the value of your contract is at least $25,000, Allianz Life offers a program
which  provides  automatic  monthly or quarterly  payments to you each year. The
total systematic  withdrawals  which you can make each year without Allianz Life
deducting a contingent  deferred  sales charge is limited to 15% of the value of
your  contract on the day the request is  received.  You may withdraw any amount
you want  under  this  program  if your  payments  are no longer  subject to the
contingent deferred sales charge. You may not participate in this program if you
own a non-qualified  contract and are under age 59 1/2. If you make  withdrawals
under this  program,  you may not also use the 15% free  withdrawal  amount that
year. For a discussion of the contingent  deferred sales charge and the 15% free
withdrawal amount, see Section 5 - Expenses.  All Systematic Withdrawals will be
made on the 9th day of the month unless that day is not a business day. If it is
not,  then the  withdrawal  will be made the previous  business day.            

INCOME TAXES MAY APPLY TO SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWALS.                               
MINIMUM  DISTRIBUTION  PROGRAM                                                  

If you own a contract that is an Individual  Retirement  Annuity (IRA),  you may
select the Minimum Distribution Program.  Under this program,  Allianz Life will
make  payments  to  you  that  are  designed  to  meet  the  applicable  minimum
distribution  requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for IRAs. If the
value of your contract is at least  $25,000,  Allianz Life will make payments to
you on a monthly or quarterly  basis.  The  payments  will not be subject to the
contingent  deferred sales charge and will be instead of the 15% free withdrawal
amount.                                                                         

SUSPENSION  OF  PAYMENTS  OR  TRANSFERS                                         

Allianz Life may be required to suspend or postpone  payments for withdrawals or
transfers for any period when:                                                  

   1.    the New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend
and  holiday  closings);                                                        

2.    trading  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  is  restricted;   

   3.   an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the fund shares
is not reasonably practicable or Allianz Life cannot reasonably value the fund  
shares;                                                                         

   4.   during any other period when the Securities and Exchange Commission,
by  order,  so  permits  for  the  protection  of   Contract Owners.            

Allianz  Life has  reserved  the  right to defer  payment  for a  withdrawal  or
transfer from the fixed account for the period permitted by law but not for more
than six months.                                                                

8.  PERFORMANCE                                                                 

Allianz Life periodically  advertises  performance of the various funds. Allianz
Life will  calculate  performance by  determining  the percentage  change in the
value of an accumulation unit by dividing the increase  (decrease) for that unit
by the value of the  accumulation  unit at the  beginning  of the  period.  This
performance number reflects the deduction of the insurance charges.  It does not
reflect the deduction of any  applicable  contingent  deferred  sales charge and
contract   maintenance   charge.  The  deduction  of  any  applicable   contract
maintenance  charge and  contingent  deferred  sales  charges  would  reduce the
percentage increase or make greater any percentage  decrease.  Any advertisement
will also  include  average  annual  total  return  figures  which  reflect  the
deduction of the insurance  charges,  contract  maintenance  charge,  contingent
deferred  sales  charges and the  expenses of the funds.  Allianz  Life may also
advertise  aggregate  total  return  information.   Aggregate  total  return  is
determined the same way except that the results are not annualized.             

Certain  funds  have  been in  existence  for  some  time  and  have  investment
performance history. However, the contracts are new. In order to demonstrate how
the actual investment  experience of the funds may affect your accumulation unit
values, Allianz Life has prepared hypothetical  performance  information (Part A
of the Appendix to this prospectus). The performance is based on the performance
of the funds,  modified to reflect the charges and expenses of your  contract as
if it had been in existence for the time periods shown. The information is based
upon the historical  experience of the funds and does not necessarily  represent
what your investment would earn in those funds.                                 

The Mutual Shares Securities Fund and the Mutual Discovery  Securities Fund (New
Valuemark  funds)  are  newly  created  and  therefore  also do not yet have any
meaningful   performance  history.   However,  they  have  the  same  investment
objectives and portfolio managers and substantially the same investment policies
as two  corresponding  series of Franklin  Mutual  Series  Fund Inc.  (formerly,
Mutual Series Fund Inc.) which have been sold to the public (Public  Funds).  In
order to show how the  performance  of the  Public  Funds  would  have  affected
accumulation unit values,  hypothetical  performance  information was developed.
Part B of the Appendix to this  prospectus  shows the historical  performance of
the Public  Funds  which  reflects  the  deduction  of the  historical  fees and
expenses paid by the Public Funds and not those paid by the New Valuemark funds.
There are  hypothetical  performance  figures for the  accumulation  units which
assume  the   deduction  of  the   Mortality   and  Expense  Risk  Charge,   the
Administrative  Charge and the fees and  expenses  that the Public  Funds  paid.
There are also hypothetical performance figures for the accumulation units which
reflect  the  deduction  of  the   Mortality   and  Expense  Risk  Charge,   the
Administrative  Charge,  the  Contingent  Deferred  Sales  Charge,  the contract
maintenance  charge and the fees and expenses  that the Public  Funds paid.  The
hypothetical  performance  figures  for the  accumulation  units  have  not been
restated to reflect the higher fees for the New Valuemark  funds.  If the higher
fees were  used,  the  hypothetical  performance  shown  would be lower.  Future
performance may vary and the results shown are not necessarily representative of
future results.                                                                 

Allianz Life may in the future also advertise yield  information for one or more
of the funds.  If it does,  it will provide you with  information  regarding how
yield is  calculated.  More detailed  information  regarding how  performance is
calculated is found in the SAI.                                                 

Any  performance  advertised  will be  based  on  historical  data  and does not
guarantee future results of the funds.                                          

9.  DEATH  BENEFIT                                                              
UPON  YOUR  DEATH                                                               

If you die during the accumulation phase,  Allianz Life will pay a death benefit
to your  beneficiary  (see  below).  No death  benefit is paid during the income
phase. If you have a joint owner,  and the joint owner dies, the surviving owner
will be  considered  the  beneficiary.  Joint owners must be spouses  (except in
Pennsylvania  and Oregon).                                                      

The death benefit will be the greater of: 1) the current value of your contract,
less any  taxes on the day all  claim  proofs  and  payment  election  forms are
received by Allianz Life at the Valuemark  Service Center; or 2) as set forth in
the enhanced death benefit  endorsement to the contract,  the guaranteed minimum
death benefit,  less any taxes, as of the day you die.  Certain  Contract Owners
will not receive an enhanced death benefit  endorsement.  For these owners,  the
death  benefit is as set forth in Item No. 1 above.  During the first year,  the
guaranteed  minimum death  benefit is equal to the payments you have made,  less
any money you have  taken out and any  charges  paid on the money you have taken
out. After the first year and before your 76th birthday,  the guaranteed minimum
death  benefit is the greater of: A) payments you have made,  less any money you
have taken out and charges paid on the money you have taken out, increased by 5%
per year on each contract anniversary;  or B) the highest of the contract values
for each six year contract anniversary  determined by the contract value on such
six year anniversary plus any payments made, less any money taken out since that
contract  anniversary,  and charges paid on the money you have taken out.  After
your 76th birthday,  the guaranteed minimum death benefit will only be increased
by any payments you have made since the last  contract  anniversary  before your
76th  birthday  less any money you have  taken out and any  charges  paid on the
money you have taken out since such  contract  anniversary.  If you have a joint
owner,  the age of the oldest  owner will be used to  determine  the  guaranteed
minimum death benefit.  The guaranteed  minimum death benefit will be reduced by
any amounts  withdrawn  after the date of death.  If the  contract is owned by a
non-natural person, then all references to you mean the annuitant.              

The death benefit provision described above may not                             
be available in your state.  If it is not  available,  the death benefit will be
equal to the value of your contract (less any premium taxes) on the business day
that Allianz Life receives proof of the death and payment instructions.         

A beneficiary may request that the death benefit be paid in one of the following
ways:  (1)  payment of the entire  death  benefit  within 5 years of the date of
death;  or (2) payment of the death benefit under an annuity  option.  The death
benefit  payable  under an annuity  option  must be paid over the  beneficiary's
lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the beneficiary's life expectancy.
Payment must begin within one year of the date of death.  If the  beneficiary is
the spouse of the contract owner,  he/she can choose to continue the contract in
his/her own name at the then current  value,  or if greater,  the death  benefit
value. If a lump sum payment is elected and all the necessary  requirements  are
met, the payment will be made within 7 days.                                    

If you (or any joint  owner) die  during  the  income  phase and you are not the
annuitant,  any payments which are remaining  under the annuity option  selected
will continue at least as rapidly as they were being paid at your death.  If you
die during the income phase, the beneficiary becomes the contract owner.        

DEATH  OF  ANNUITANT                                                            

If the annuitant,  who is not a contract  owner or joint owner,  dies during the
accumulation  phase,  you can name a new  annuitant.  If a new  annuitant is not
named  within  30 days of the  death  of the  annuitant,  you  will  become  the
annuitant.  However,  if the contract  owner is a non-natural  person  (e.g.,  a
corporation),  then the death of the  annuitant  will be treated as the death of
the contract owner, and a new annuitant may not be named.                       

If the annuitant dies after annuity payments have begun,  the remaining  amounts
payable,  if any, will be as provided for in the annuity  option  selected.  The
remaining amounts payable will be paid to the contract owner at least as rapidly
as they were being paid at the annuitant's death.                               

10.  OTHER  INFORMATION                                                         
ALLIANZ  LIFE                                                                   

Allianz Life Insurance  Company of North America  (Allianz Life),  1750 Hennepin
Avenue, Minneapolis,  Minnesota 55403, was organized under the laws of the state
of Minnesota in 1896.  Allianz Life offers fixed and variable life insurance and
annuities  and group  life,  accident  and  health  insurance.  Allianz  Life is
licensed to do business in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  Allianz Life
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Versicherungs-AG Holding.               

THE  SEPARATE  ACCOUNT                                                          

Allianz Life  established a separate  account,  Allianz Life Variable  Account B
(Separate Account), to hold the assets that underlie the contracts. The Board of
Directors of Allianz Life adopted a resolution to establish the Separate Account
under Minnesota  insurance law on May 31, 1985.  Allianz Life has registered the
Separate  Account  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as  a  unit
investment trust under the Investment  Company Act of 1940. The Separate Account
is divided into sub-accounts. Each sub-account invests in a fund.               

The assets of the Separate  Account are held in Allianz Life's name on behalf of
the Separate Account and legally belong to Allianz Life.  However,  those assets
that underlie the contracts,  are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of
any other business  Allianz Life may conduct.  All the income,  gains and losses
(realized or unrealized)  resulting from these assets are credited to or charged
against  the  contracts  and not against any other  contracts  Allianz  Life may
issue.                                                                          

DISTRIBUTION                                                                    

NALAC Financial  Plans LLC (NFP) 1750 Hennepin  Avenue,  Minneapolis,  MN 55403,
acts as the  distributor of the contracts.  NFP is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Allianz Life.                                                                   

Commissions   will  be  paid  to   broker-dealers   who  sell   the   contracts.
Broker-dealers  will  be paid  commissions  up to  6.0%  of  purchase  payments.
Sometimes,  Allianz Life enters into an agreement with the  broker-dealer to pay
the  broker-dealer  commissions  as a  combination  of a  certain  amount of the
commission at the time of sale and a trail commission  (which when totaled could
exceed  6% of  purchase  payments).  In  addition,  Allianz  Life  and  Franklin
Advisers,  Inc. and/or its affiliates may pay certain sellers for other services
not directly  related to the sale of the  contracts  (such as special  marketing
support allowances).  To the extent that the contingent deferred sales charge is
insufficient to cover the actual cost of distribution,  Allianz Life may use any
of its  corporate  assets,  including  any profit from the mortality and expense
risk charge, to make up any difference.                                         

ADMINISTRATION                                                                  

Allianz Life has hired Delaware Valley  Financial  Services,  Inc.  (DVFS),  300
Berwyn Park, Berwyn, Pennsylvania,  to perform administrative services regarding
the contracts. The administrative services include issuance of the contracts and
maintenance of contract owner's records.                                        

FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS                                                           

The consolidated  financial  statements of Allianz Life and the Separate Account
have been included in the Statement of Additional Information.                  

APPENDIX                                                                        
PERFORMANCE  INFORMATION                                                        

The following information is based on the historical  investment  performance of
the  funds.  The  results  shown are not  necessarily  representative  of future
performance.                                                                    

PART  A  -  FRANKLIN  VALUEMARK  FUNDS  -  EXISTING  FUNDS                    

The funds of Franklin  Valuemark  Funds have been in existence for some time and
have  investment  performance  history  (except the Small Cap,  Capital  Growth,
Templeton  International Smaller Companies,  Mutual Shares Securities and Mutual
Discovery Securities Funds). In order to show you how investment  performance of
the funds affects accumulation unit values, we have developed the following     
hypothetical  performance  information.                                         

The chart below shows the actual historical investment  performance of the funds
and hypothetical  accumulation unit performance.  The hypothetical  accumulation
unit performance  assumes that the  accumulation  units were invested in each of
the funds for the same periods.  The performance figures in Column I reflect the
deduction  of the  actual  fees  and  expenses  paid  by the  funds.  Column  II
represents  hypothetical  performance  figures for the accumulation  units which
reflects the deduction of the insurance charges and the fees and expenses of the
funds.   Column  III  represents   hypothetical   performance  figures  for  the
accumulation   units  which  reflects  the  insurance   charges,   the  contract
maintenance charge, the fees and expenses of the funds and assumes that you make
a withdrawal at the end of the period  (therefore the contingent  deferred sales
charge is reflected).

PART  B  -  PUBLIC  FUNDS                                                     

The Mutual Shares  Securities  Fund and Mutual  Discovery  Securities Fund ("New
Valuemark  funds") are newly created series of Franklin  Valuemark  Funds and do
not yet have any meaningful  performance  history.  The New Valuemark  funds do,
however,  have the same  investment  objective  and portfolio  managers,(1)  and
substantially  the same  investment  policies,  as two  corresponding  series of
Franklin Mutual Series Fund Inc. (formerly "Mutual Series Fund Inc.") which have
been sold directly to the public ("Public Funds").                              

Chart 1 below  shows  the past  performance  of the  Public  Funds,  in terms of
average  annual total return over the periods  indicated.  Average  annual total
return  represents the average annual change in value of an investment  over the
stated  periods,  assuming  reinvestment  of dividends  and capital gains at net
asset value.  These  figures  reflect the deduction of the  historical  fees and
expenses paid by the Public Funds, which have been sold without sales charges.  

Chart  2 below shows hypothetical performance of accumulation units of the New  
Valuemark  funds,  based on the past average annual total return of the Public  
Funds  and  the  deduction  of  all current recurring expenses of the Separate  
Account. These figures do not reflect any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge      
or annual contract maintenance charge and have  not  been restated to reflect   
the higher  expenses of the New  Valuemark  funds;  all of which would lower the
hypothetical performance shown.                                                 

Chart  3 below shows hypothetical performance of accumulation units of the New  
Valuemark  funds,  based on the past average annual total return of the Public  
Funds  and  the  deduction  of  all current recurring expenses of the Separate  
Account, as well as deduction of the annual contract maintenance charge and     
the applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. These figures have not been    
restated to reflect the higher  expenses of the New Valuemark  funds which would
lower the hypothetical performance shown.                                       

Past performance cannot predict or guarantee future results of the New Valuemark
funds. In addition,  the investment  performance of the New Valuemark funds will
differ from the performance of the Public Funds because of product and portfolio
differences,  including differences in portfolio size, the investments held, the
timing of purchases of similar  investments,  cash flows,  minor  differences in
certain  investment  policies,  insurance  product  related tax  diversification
requirements,  state insurance  regulations,  and additional  administrative and
insurance  costs  associated with insurance  company  separate  accounts.  These
figures are not adjusted for tax consequences.

(1) In November 1996, Franklin Resources, Inc., parent company of the investment
managers of the Franklin  Valuemark  Funds,  completed the  acquisition of Heine
Securities  Corporation,  the investment manager of Mutual Series Fund Inc. This
transaction  did  not,  however,  change  the  individuals  responsible  for the
day-to-day  operations  of  Franklin  Mutual  Series  Fund  Inc.,  who are  also
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the New Valuemark funds.

ALLIANZ LIFE VARIABLE ACCOUNT B                                                 
OF ALLIANZ LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA                              
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
June 30, 1997 (unaudited)                                                       

1. Organization                                                                 

Allianz Life Variable  Account B (Variable  Account) is a segregated  investment
account of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) and is
registered  with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission as a unit  investment
trust  pursuant  to the  provisions  of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 (as
amended).  The Variable  Account was  established  on May 31, 1985 and commenced
operations January 24, 1989. Accordingly, it is an accounting entity wherein all
segregated account transactions are reflected.                                  

The Variable  Account's assets are the property of Allianz Life and are held for
the benefit of the owners and other persons  entitled to payments under variable
annuity  contracts  issued  through the  Variable  Account and  underwritten  by
Allianz  Life.  The assets of the  Variable  Account,  equal to the reserves and
other liabilities of the Variable  Account,  are not chargeable with liabilities
that arise from any other business which Allianz Life may conduct.              

The Variable  Account's  sub-accounts may invest, at net asset values, in one or
more of the funds of the Franklin  Valuemark  Funds  (FVF),  managed by Franklin
Advisers, Inc. and its Templeton and Franklin affiliates, in accordance with the
selection made by the contract owner.  Not all funds are available as investment
options for the products which comprise the Variable Account.                   

Certain  officers and trustees of the FVF are also officers and/or  directors of
Franklin Advisers, Inc. and/or Allianz Life.                                    

2. Significant Accounting Policies                                              

Use of Estimates                                                                

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                               

Investments                                                                     

Investments  of the Variable  Account are valued daily at market value using net
asset values provided by Franklin Advisers, Inc.                                

Realized investment gains include realized gain distributions  received from the
respective  funds and  gains on the sale of fund  shares  as  determined  by the
average  cost  method.   Realized  gain  distributions  are  reinvested  in  the
respective funds. Dividend distributions received from the FVF are reinvested in
additional  shares of the FVF and are recorded as income to the Variable Account
on the ex-dividend date.                                                        

Two Fixed Account  investment options are available to deferred annuity contract
owners.  A Flexible Fixed Option is available to all deferred  annuity  contract
owners and a Dollar Cost Averaging  Option is available to Valuemark IV deferred
annuity contract owners. These accounts are comprised of equity and fixed income
investments  which  are  part  of  the  general  assets  of  Allianz  Life.  The
liabilities of the Fixed Accounts are part of the general obligations of Allianz
Life and are not included in the Variable Account.  The guaranteed  minimum rate
of return on the Fixed Accounts is 3%.                                          

The Capital Growth Fund and Templeton  International Smaller Companies Fund were

June 30, 1997 (unaudited)                                                       

2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)                                      

Contracts in Annuity Payment Period                                             

Annuity reserves are computed for currently payable  contracts  according to the
1983 Individual  Annuity  Mortality Table,  using an assumed  investment  return
(AIR) equal to the AIR of the specific  contracts,  either 3% or 5%.  Charges to
annuity  reserves for mortality and risk expense are  reimbursed to Allianz Life
if the  reserves  required are less than  originally  estimated.  If  additional
reserves are required, Allianz Life reimburses the account.                     

Expenses                                                                        

Asset Based Expenses                                                            

A mortality and expense risk charge is deducted  from the Variable  Account on a
daily basis.  The charge is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the daily net
assets of Valuemark II,  Valuemark  III, and Valuemark  Income Plus and 1.34% of
the daily net assets of Valuemark IV.                                           

An administrative  charge is deducted from the Variable Account on a daily basis
equal,  on an annual  basis,  to 0.15% of the daily net  assets of all  products
which comprise the Variable Account.                                            

Contract Based Expenses                                                         

A contract  maintenance  charge is paid by the contract owner annually from each
deferred  annuity  contract  by  liquidating  contract  units  at the end of the
contract year and at the time of full surrender. The amount of the charge is $30
each year.  Contract  maintenance charges paid by the contract owners during the
period ended June 30, 1997 (unaudited) and the year ended December 31, 1996 were
$2,370,119 and $4,491,487, respectively. These contract charges are reflected in
the Statements of Changes in Net Assets as other transactions.                  

A contingent  deferred  sales charge is deducted from the contract  value at the
time of a  surrender.  This  charge  applies  only to a  surrender  of  purchase
payments  received  within five years of the date of surrender  for Valuemark II
and  Valuemark III contracts and within seven years of the date of surrender for
Valuemark IV contracts.  For this purpose,  purchase payments are allocated on a
first-in, first-out basis. The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is
calculated by: (a) allocating purchase payments to the amount  surrendered;  and
(b)  multiplying  each allocated  purchase  payment that has been held under the
contract for the period shown below by the charge shown below:

and (c) adding the products of each multiplication in (b) above.                

A Valuemark II or Valuemark III deferred  annuity  contract  owner may, not more
frequently  than once  annually on a  cumulative  basis,  make a surrender  each
contract year of fifteen percent (15%) of purchase payments paid, less any prior
surrenders, without incurring a contingent deferred sales charge. A Valuemark IV
deferred  annuity contract owner may make multiple  surrenders,  each year after
the first  contract  year,  up to fifteen  percent  (15%) of the contract  value
without incurring a contingent  deferred sales charge.  For a partial surrender,
the  contingent  deferred  sales  charge  will be  deducted  from the  remaining
contract  value,  if  sufficient;  otherwise it will be deducted from the amount
surrendered. Total contingent deferred sales charges paid by the contract owners
for the period ended June 30, 1997  (unaudited)  and the year ended December 31,
1996 were $4,688,856 and $10,529,337, respectively.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)                                      

Contract Based Expenses (cont.)                                                 

Currently,  twelve transfers are permitted each contract year.  Thereafter,  the
fee is $25 per transfer,  or 2% of the amount transferred,  if less.  Currently,
transfers  associated  with the dollar cost  averaging  program are not counted.
Total transfer charges paid by the contract owners for the period ended June 30,
1997  (unaudited) and the year ended December 31, 1996 were $53,071 and $93,255,
respectively. Transfer charges are reflected in the Statements of Changes in Net
Assets as other  transactions.  Net  transfers  from the Fixed  Accounts for the
period ended June 30, 1997  (unaudited)  were  $8,058,767.  Net transfers to the
Fixed Accounts were $16,138,672 during the year ended December 31, 1996.        

Premium  taxes or other taxes  payable to a state or other  governmental  entity
will be charged  against  the  contract  values.  Allianz  Life may, in its sole
discretion, pay taxes when due and deduct that amount from the contract value at
a later date.  Payment at an earlier date does not waive any right  Allianz Life
may have to deduct such amounts at a later date.                                

On  Valuemark II and  Valuemark  III deferred  annuity  contracts,  a systematic
withdrawal  plan is  available  which  allows  an owner to  withdraw  up to nine
percent (9%) of purchase payments less prior surrenders  annually,  paid monthly
or  quarterly,  without  incurring  a  contingent  deferred  sales  charge.  The
systematic  withdrawal plan available to Valuemark IV deferred  annuity contract
owners  allows up to  fifteen  percent  (15%) of the  contract  value  withdrawn
annually,  paid monthly or quarterly,  without  incurring a contingent  deferred
sales charge.  The exercise of the  systematic  withdrawal  plan in any contract
year  replaces  the 15% penalty  free  privilege  for that year for all deferred
annuity contracts.                                                              

A  rescission  is defined as a contract  that is  returned to the Company by the
Contract Owner and canceled  within the free-look  period,  generally  within 10
days.

Allianz Life provides  capital for the  establishment of new funds as investment
options  of the  Variable  Account.  There were no  capitalization  transactions
during  the  period  ended  June  30,  1997  (unaudited).   The   capitalization
transactions were as follows during the year ended December 31, 1996:

4. Federal Income Taxes                                                         

Operations  of the  Variable  Account  form a  part  of,  and  are  taxed  with,
operations of Allianz Life, which is taxed as a life insurance company under the
Internal Revenue Code.                                                          

Allianz Life does not expect to incur any federal  income taxes in the operation
of the Variable  Account.  If, in the future,  Allianz Life  determines that the
Variable  Account may incur federal  income  taxes,  it may then assess a charge
against the Variable Account for such taxes.

The investment options referenced below may not be offered in certain annuity products listed above. See your product prospectus for investment option availability and see your Investment Option prospectus for further information regarding the following updates. 1. AZL Morgan Stanley Mid Cap Growth Fund At its meeting on June 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust considered and approved changes proposed by the Fund s Manager, Allianz Investment Management LLC, to the name and principal investment strategies of the AZL Morgan Stanley Mid Cap Growth Fund. As a result of these changes, the Fund will add a second subadviser and be re-named the AZL Multi-Manager Mid Cap Growth Fund. Accordingly, the following changes will be made, effective on or about November 23, 2015: The name of the Fund will be changed to AZL Multi-Manager Mid Cap Growth Fund The Investment Management Company and Adviser/Subadviser, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, for the above mentioned Investment Option will be updated as follows: Managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC/Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. The Primary Investments, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, for the above mentioned Investment Option will be updated as follows: Invests in a combination of two subportfolios, or strategies, with equal allocations of the assets to each strategy. The fund as a whole will normally invest at least 80% of net assets in equity securities of mid cap companies, with market capitalizations within the range of the Russell Midcap Growth Index. 2. The names of the following Investment Options are changed to the new names listed below: New Name MFS VIT Total Return Bond Portfolio PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio Previous Name MFS VIT Research Bond Portfolio PIMCO EqS Pathfinder Portfolio PRO Page 1 of 24 The Investment Objective for the PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, is replaced as follows: Seeks to provide current income that exceeds the average yield on global stocks, with a secondary objective to provide long-term capital appreciation. The Primary Investments for the PIMCO VIT Global Dividend Portfolio, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus, is replaced as follows: Normally invests at least 75% of its assets in equity securities, including common and preferred stock, of issuers that PIMCO believes are attractively valued that currently pay dividends and have the potential for earnings and dividend growth over time. May invest a significant portion of its assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to foreign countries. 3. AZL Money Market Fund In July 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted certain amendments to the regulations governing money market mutual funds, which will change significantly the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate. At its meeting on June 16, 2015, the Board of Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust considered the likely effects of the rule changes on the AZL Money Market Fund and approved changes proposed by the Fund s Manager, Allianz Investment Management LLC, to the name and principal investment strategies of the Fund. As a result of these changes, the Fund will become a government money market fund and will be called the AZL Government Money Market Fund. As a government money market fund, the Fund will be permitted, subject to the revised regulations, to continue to use a stable net asset value ($1.00), and the Fund will not be required to impose fees on shareholder redemptions or to temporarily suspend redemptions in the event that the Fund s weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold. The Board believes that this result is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The changes to the Fund are expected to be fully implemented by May 1, 2016, prior to the final compliance dates for the new rules; however, it is anticipated that the Fund s subadviser, BlackRock Advisors, LLC, will begin immediately to gradually implement changes to the Fund s portfolio in order to provide the most efficient transition. As a result, it is expected that the Fund gradually will allocate a larger percentage of its assets to government securities over time until it reaches its new allocation on or about May 1, Because the yields on government securities generally may be expected to be lower than the yields on comparable non-government securities, it should be expected that the Fund s yield will decrease as more assets are invested in government securities. As a result of these changes approved by the Board of Trustees, the Fund is no longer subject to the requirement that it invest at least 25% of its assets in the financial services industry. Effective on or about May 1, 2016, the name of the Fund will be changed to AZL Government Money Market Fund and the Primary Investments, included in the Investment Options section of the prospectus is expected to be updated to the following: Invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully. Investments include U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations. In addition, the Fund may invest in variable and floating rate instruments. 4. Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York Address The address for Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York, as included in the Other Information section of the prospectuses for Allianz Vision New York, Retirement Pro New York and Index Advantage New York, is updated to the following: 28 Liberty Street, 38th floor, New York, NY All correspondence, payments, and applications should still be directed to the service office addresses listed on the back page of the prospectus. PRO Page 2 of 25 ALLIANZ HIGH FIVE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT Issued by Allianz Life Variable Account B and Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our) This prospectus describes an individual flexible purchase payment variable deferred annuity contract (Contract) issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life, we, us, our). The Contract is a flexible purchase payment contract because you (the Owner) can make more than one Purchase Payment, subject to certain restrictions. The Contract is variable because the Contract Value and any variable Annuity Payments you receive increase or decrease depending on the performance of the Investment Options you select (in this prospectus, the term Investment Options refers only to the variable Investment Choices listed on the following page, and not to any fixed Investment Choices). The Contract is deferred because you do not begin receiving regular Annuity Payments immediately. All guarantees under the Contract are the obligations of Allianz Life and are subject to our claims paying ability. Please read this prospectus before investing and keep it for future reference. It contains important information about your annuity and Allianz Life that you ought to know before investing. This prospectus is not an offering in any state, country, or jurisdiction in which we are not authorized to sell the Contracts. You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with information that is different. Additional information about the Separate Account has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is available upon written or oral request without charge, or on the EDGAR database on the SEC s website (www.sec.gov). A Statement of Additional Information (SAI) dated the same date as this prospectus includes additional information about the annuity offered by this prospectus. The SAI is incorporated by reference into this prospectus. The SAI is filed with the SEC and is available without charge by contacting us at the telephone number or address listed at the back of this prospectus. The SAI s table of contents appears after the Privacy and Security Statement in this prospectus. The prospectus, SAI and other Contract information are also available on the EDGAR database. The SEC has not approved or disapproved these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. An investment in this Contract is not a deposit of a bank or financial institution and is not federally insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other federal government agency. An investment in this Contract involves investment risk including the possible loss of principal. Variable annuity contracts are complex insurance and investment vehicles. Before you invest, be sure to ask your Financial Professional about the Contract s features, benefits, risks, and fees, and whether the Contract is appropriate for you based upon your financial situation and objectives. Dated: April 27, 2015 This prospectus discusses three versions of the same Contract. The Original Contract first became available on September 20, 2002 and was replaced in all states except Washington by the May 2005 Contract. The May 2005 Contract first became available on May 1, 2005 and was replaced in all states except Washington by the February 2007 Contract. The body of this prospectus is written according to the features of the February 2007 Contract. The product features and expenses of the Original Contract and the February 2007 Contract differ in certain respects (see Appendix E to this prospectus). The only difference between the May 2005 Contract and February 2007 Contract is the amount of the mortality and expense risk charge (see the Fee Tables and section 7, Expenses Mortality and Expense Risk (M&E) Charge). 16 We currently offer the Investment Options listed below. You can invest in up to 15 Investment Options at any one time. Currently, the only fixed Investment Choices we offer under our general account are the Fixed Period Accounts (FPAs). You can only allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs. However, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees we will make transfers to and from the FPAs to support these guarantees and we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary. One or more of the Investment Choices may not be available in your state. We may add, substitute or remove Investment Choices in the future. Contracts with the Guaranteed Account Value (GAV) Benefit are subject to systematic transfers between your selected Investment Options and the FPAs. This means that you may not always be able to fully participate in any upside potential returns available from the Investment Options and your Contract Value may potentially be less than the Contract Value you would have had without the GAV Benefit. Transfers out of the FPAs may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment that may increase or decrease your Contract Value and/or the amount of the transfer.

Separate Account Allianz Life Variable Account B is the Separate Account that issues your Contract. It is a separate investment account of Allianz Life. The Separate Account holds the assets invested in the Investment Options that underlie the Contracts. The Separate Account is divided into subaccounts, each of which invests exclusively in a single Investment Option. Separate Account Value the portion of your Contract Value that is in the subaccounts of the Separate Account during the Accumulation Phase. We calculate the Separate Account Value by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value in each subaccount by the number of Accumulation Units for each subaccount and then adding those results together. Service Center the Allianz Service Center. Our Service Center address and telephone number are listed in the following section. Traditional Annuity Payments Annuity Payments we make to the Payee based on the Contract Value. True Up an amount we may pay into your Contract under the GAV Benefit. Withdrawal Charge Basis the total amount under your Contract that is subject to a withdrawal charge. 611 FEE TABLES The following tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay when owning and taking a withdrawal from the Contract. For more information, see section 7, Expenses. The first tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay if you take a withdrawal from the Contract during the Accumulation Phase or if you make transfers. CONTRACT OWNER TRANSACTION EXPENSES (1) Withdrawal Charge During the Accumulation Phase (2),(3) (as a percentage of each Purchase Payment withdrawn) Number of Complete Years Since We Received Your Purchase Payment Charge 0 8% 1 8% (4) 2 7% 3 6% 4 5% 5 4% 6 3% 7 years or more 0% Transfer Fee (5)... $25 Premium Tax (6)... 0% to 3.5% (as a percentage of each Purchase Payment) (1) Amounts withdrawn or transferred out of a FPA may be subject to an MVA. This MVA may increase or decrease your Contract Value and/or your transfer or withdrawal amount. For more information, please see section 5, Our General Account Market Value Adjustment (MVA). (2) The partial withdrawal privilege for each Contract Year is equal to 12% of your total Purchase Payments, less any previous withdrawals taken under the partial withdrawal privilege, GWB, or as a required minimum distribution payment in the same Contract Year and before any MVA. We do not deduct a withdrawal charge from amounts withdrawn under the partial withdrawal privilege, but an MVA may apply. There is no partial withdrawal privilege during the Annuity Phase. Any unused partial withdrawal privilege in one Contract Year is not added to the amount that is available in the next Contract Year. For more details and additional information on other penalty-free withdrawal options, please see the discussion of the partial withdrawal privilege and other information that appears in section 9, Access to Your Money. (3) The total amount under your Contract that is subject to a withdrawal charge is the Withdrawal Charge Basis. The Withdrawal Charge Basis is equal to the total Purchase Payments, less any Purchase Payments withdrawn (excluding any penalty-free withdrawals), less any withdrawal charges. (4) 7.5% in Alabama, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington. (5) The first twelve transfers in a Contract Year are free. We count all transfers made in the same Business Day as one transfer. The following transfers are not subject to a transfer fee and do not count against any free transfers we allow: dollar cost averaging transfers, flexible rebalancing transfers, and GAV Transfers. Currently, we deduct this fee only during the Accumulation Phase, but we reserve the right to deduct this fee during the Annuity Phase. For more information, please see section 7, Expenses Transfer Fee. (6) It is our current practice not to make deductions from the Contract Value to reimburse ourselves for premium tax that we pay, although we reserve the right to make such a deduction in the future. For more information, please see section 7, Expenses Premium Tax. 712 CONTRACT OWNER PERIODIC EXPENSES The next tables describe the fees and expenses that you pay periodically during the time that you own your Contract, not including the Investment Options fees and expenses. The Separate Account annual expenses include the mortality and expense risk (M&E) charge. During the Accumulation Phase: Contract Maintenance Charge (7)... $40 (per Contract per year) Separate Account Annual Expenses The annualized rate is realized on a daily basis as a percentage of the net asset value of an Investment Option. M&E Charge February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, 2007 Original Contract issued before June 22, 2007 and May 2005 Contract Traditional GMDB 1.25% 1.40% Enhanced GMDB 1.45% 1.60% During the Annuity Phase: Contract Maintenance Charge (7)... $40 (per Contract per year) Separate Account Annual Expenses if you request variable Traditional Annuity Payments The annualized rate is realized on a daily basis as a percentage of each Investment Option s net asset value.

For more information, please see section 7, Expenses Contract Maintenance Charge. (8) Because the Contract allows Partial Annuitization, it is possible for different portions of the Contract to be in both the Accumulation and Annuity Phases at the same time. It is also possible to have a different M&E charge on different portions of the Contract at the same time if you request variable Traditional Annuity Payments under a Partial Annuitization. For more information, please see section 3, The Annuity Phase Partial Annuitization. ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS This table describes the total annual operating expenses associated with the Investment Options and shows the minimum and maximum expenses for the period ended December 31, 2014, charged by any of the Investment Options before the effect of any contractual expense reimbursement or fee waiver. We show the expenses as a percentage of an Investment Option s average daily net assets. Minimum Maximum Total annual Investment Option operating expenses* (including management fees, distribution or 12b-1 fees, and other expenses) before fee waivers and expense reimbursements 0.49% 1.71% * Some of the Investment Options or their affiliates may also pay service fees to us or our affiliates. The amount of these fees may be different for each Investment Option. The maximum current fee is 0.25%. The amount of these fees, if deducted from Investment Option assets, is reflected in the above table. 813 EXAMPLES The expenses for your Contract may be different from those shown in the examples below depending upon which Investment Option(s) you select and the benefits that apply. These examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in a Contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. These costs include Contract Owner transaction expenses, Contract Owner periodic expenses, and the annual operating expenses of the Investment Options before the effect of reimbursements and waivers. You should not consider the examples below as a representation of past or future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. We deduct the total $40 contract maintenance charge in the examples at the end of each year during the Accumulation Phase. Please note that this charge does not apply during the Accumulation Phase if your Contract Value, at the end of year is at least $75,000, or during the Annuity Phase if your Contract Value on the Income Date is at least $75,000 (see section 7, Expenses Contract Maintenance Charge). A transfer fee may apply, but is not reflected in these examples (see section 7, Expenses Transfer Fee). If you take a full withdrawal at the end of each time period, and assuming a $10,000 investment and a 5% annual return on your money, you may pay expenses as follows. a) February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, 2007 with the Enhanced GMDB (the highest M&E charge of 1.45%). b) February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, 2007 with the Traditional GMDB (the lowest M&E charge of 1.25%). Total annual Investment Option operating expenses before any fee waivers or expense reimbursements of: 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years 1.71% (the maximum Investment Option operating expense) a) $1,159 $1,794 $2,354 $3,867 b) $1,139 $1,735 $2,257 $3, % (the minimum Investment Option operating expense) a) $1,037 $1,429 $1,747 $2,664 b) $1,017 $1,368 $1,644 $2,452 In Alabama, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington, the lower withdrawal charge would result in slightly lower expense examples. If you do not take a full withdrawal or if you take a Full Annuitization* of the Contract at the end of each time period, and assuming a $10,000 investment and a 5% annual return on your money, you may pay expenses as follows. Total annual Investment Option operating expenses before any fee waivers or expense reimbursements of: 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years 1.71% (the maximum Investment Option operating expense) a) $359 $1,094 $1,854 $3,867 b) $339 $1,035 $1,757 $3, % (the minimum Investment Option operating expense) a) $237 $729 $1,247 $2,664 b) $217 $668 $1,144 $2,452 * Traditional Annuity Payments are generally not available until after the second Contract Anniversary in most states, and GMIB Payments are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary. See Appendix A for condensed financial information regarding the Accumulation Unit values (AUVs) for the highest and lowest M&E charges for the February 2007 Contract and Original Contract issued on or after June 22, See the appendix to the Statement of Additional Information for condensed financial information regarding the AUVs for other expense levels. 914 1. THE VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT The Contract is no longer offered for sale. However, as an existing Owner you can make additional Purchase Payments to your Contract during the Accumulation Phase, subject to the restrictions set out in section 2, Purchase Purchase Payments. We no longer accept additional Purchase Payments to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. An annuity is a contract between you (the Owner), and an insurance company (in this case Allianz Life), where you make payments to us and, in turn, we promise to make regular periodic payments (Annuity Payments) to the Payee. The Contract is tax deferred. You generally are not taxed on any earnings or appreciation on the assets in your Contract until you take money out of your Contract. For Qualified Contracts, the tax deferral is provided through compliance with specialized tax-qualification rules, and you do not receive any additional tax benefit by purchasing the Contract. The Contract has an Accumulation Phase and an Annuity Phase. You can take withdrawals from the Contract during the Accumulation Phase. The Accumulation Phase begins on the Issue Date and ends upon the earliest of the following. The Business Day before the Income Date if you take a Full Annuitization. The Business Day we process your request for a full withdrawal. Upon the death of any Owner (or the Annuitant if the Contract is owned by a non-individual), the Business Day we first receive in Good Order at our Service Center the death benefit payment option and due proof of death from any one Beneficiary, unless the surviving spouse/beneficiary continues the Contract. If there are multiple Beneficiaries, the remaining Contract Value continues to fluctuate with the performance of the Investment Options until the complete distribution of the death benefit. The Annuity Phase is the period during which we make Annuity Payments from the Contract. Under all Contracts, Traditional Annuity Payments are available during the Annuity Phase. Traditional Annuity Payments must begin on a designated date (the Income Date) that is at least two years after your Issue Date. For Contracts with a GMIB, you can request fixed Annuity Payments (GMIB Payments) beginning on the fifth Contract Anniversary. If you apply the entire Contract Value to Annuity Payments, we call that a Full Annuitization, and if you apply only part of the Contract Value to Annuity Payments, we call that a Partial Annuitization.* The maximum number of annuitizations you can have at any one time is five. Because the Contract allows Partial Annuitization, it is possible that some portions of the Contract are in the Accumulation Phase and other portions are in the Annuity Phase at the same time. The Annuity Phase begins on the Income Date (or the first Income Date if you take any Partial Annuitizations) and ends when all portion(s) of the Contract that you apply to Annuity Payments have ended, as indicated in section 3, The Annuity Phase. * GMIB Partial Annuitizations are based on the GMIB value and are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary and they are not available if the GMIB value is less than the Contract Value. Your Investment Choices include the Investment Options and any available general account Investment Choice. You cannot invest in more than 15 Investment Options at any one time. Depending upon market conditions, you can gain or lose value in the Contract based on the investment performance of the Investment Options. The Investment Options are designed to offer the opportunity for a better return than any available general account Investment Choice; however, this is not guaranteed. The amount of Contract Value you are able to accumulate in your Contract during the Accumulation Phase and the amount of any variable Traditional Annuity Payments we make during the Annuity Phase depend in large part upon the investment performance of any Investment Options you select. 1015 The only general account Investment Choices available during the Accumulation Phase are the Fixed Period Accounts (FPAs). You can allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs during the Accumulation Phase. However, in some states, the FPAs may only be available for GAV Transfers we make if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees. In addition, we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary in order to support the Living Guarantees. The FPAs have Account Periods ranging from one to ten years. Only one FPA is available for Purchase Payments or transfers in each Contract Year. Amounts allocated to the FPAs earn interest that we declare periodically. If you have money invested in the FPAs, the amount of Contract Value you are able to accumulate in your Contract during the Accumulation Phase depends in part upon the total interest credited to your Contract. Withdrawals or transfers from the FPAs may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment. For more information, please see section 5, Our General Account Market Value Adjustment (MVA). We do not make any changes to your Contract without your permission except as may be required by law. The Contract ends when: the Accumulation Phase ends, the Annuity Phase, if any, ends and/or if we received a Valid Claim, all applicable death benefit payments have been made. For example, if you purchased a Contract and later take a full withdrawal of the entire Contract Value, both the Accumulation Phase and the Contract end although the Annuity Phase never began and we did not make any death benefit payments. State Specific Contract Restrictions The Contract is subject to the law of the state in which it was issued. Some of the terms of your Contract may differ from the terms of a Contract delivered in another state because of state-specific legal requirements. Areas in which there may be state-specific Contract provisions may include, but are not limited to, the following. The withdrawal charge schedule. Availability of Investment Options, Annuity Options, DCA programs, endorsements, and/or riders. Selection of certain Income Dates. Selection of certain assumed investment rates for variable Annuity Payments. Our ability to restrict transfer rights. All material state variations in the Contract are disclosed in this prospectus. If you would like more information regarding state-specific Contract provisions, you should contact your Financial Professional or contact our Service Center at the toll free number listed at the back of this prospectus. OWNERSHIP Owner You, as the Owner, have all the rights under the Contract. The Owner was designated at Contract issue. The Owner may be a non-individual, which is anything other than an individual person, which could be a trust, qualified plan, or corporation. Qualified Contracts can only have one Owner. You can change Owners at any time subject to our approval. Upon our approval, any ownership change becomes effective as of the date you sign the request. Changing ownership may be a taxable event. You should consult with your tax adviser before doing this. Joint Owner Non-Qualified Contracts can be owned by up to two Owners. Upon the death of either Joint Owner, the surviving Joint Owner becomes the sole primary Beneficiary. We then treat any other Beneficiary designation on record at the time of death as a contingent Beneficiary. You can change Joint Owners under the same conditions as described for an Owner. If a Contract has Joint Owners, we generally require the signature of both Owners on any forms that are submitted to our Service Center. NOTE: Partial Annuitizations are not available to Joint Owners. There can be only one Owner, the Owner must be the Annuitant, and we do not allow the Owner to add a joint Annuitant. 1116 Annuitant The Annuitant is the individual on whose life we base Annuity Payments. You designated an Annuitant when you purchased a Contract. For Qualified Contracts, before the Income Date the Owner must be the Annuitant unless the Contract is owned by a qualified plan or is part of a custodial arrangement. You can change the Annuitant on an individually owned Non-Qualified Contract at any time before the Income Date, but you cannot change the Annuitant if the Owner is a non-individual (for example, a qualified plan or trust). Subject to our approval, you can add a joint Annuitant on the Income Date if you take a Full Annuitization. For Qualified Contracts, the ability to add a joint Annuitant is subject to any plan requirements associated with the Contract, and the joint Annuitants must be spouses. For jointly owned Contracts, if the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date, the younger Owner automatically becomes the new Annuitant, but the Owner can subsequently name another Annuitant. Designating different persons as Owner(s) and Annuitant(s) can have important impacts on whether a death benefit is paid, and on who would receive it. For example, if a sole Owner dies during the Accumulation Phase of the Contract, we pay a death benefit to the Beneficiary(s). If the Annuitant is not an Owner and he/she dies during the Accumulation Phase of the Contract, the Owner can name a new Annuitant (subject to our approval) and we do not pay a death benefit. If a sole Owner who is not an Annuitant dies during the Annuity Phase, the Beneficiary becomes the Owner, Annuity Payments continue and we do not pay a death benefit. If an Annuitant dies after a Full Annuitization under an Annuity Option with a guaranteed period, Annuity Payments to the Payee continue until the Contract ends and are paid at least as rapidly as they were being paid at the time of the Annuitant s death. Use care when designating Owners and Annuitants, and consult your Financial Professional if you have questions. Payee The Payee is the person or entity who receives Annuity Payments during the Annuity Phase. The Owner receives tax reporting on those payments. Generally we require the Payee to be an Owner. However, we may allow you to name a charitable trust, financial institution, qualified plan, or an individual specified in a court order as a Payee subject to our approval. For Qualified Contracts owned by a qualified plan, the qualified plan must be the Payee. Beneficiary The Beneficiary is the person(s) or entity you designated at Contract issue to receive any death benefit. You can change the Beneficiary or contingent Beneficiary at any time before your death unless you name an irrevocable Beneficiary. If a Beneficiary predeceases you, or you and a Beneficiary die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation, that Beneficiary s interest in this Contract ends unless your Beneficiary designation specifies otherwise. If there are no surviving Beneficiaries or if there is no named Beneficiary, we pay the death benefit to your estate or the Owner if the Owner is a non-individual. NOTE FOR JOINTLY OWNED CONTRACTS: The sole primary Beneficiary is the surviving Joint Owner regardless of any other named Beneficiaries. Spousal Joint Owners may also appoint contingent Beneficiaries. However, Joint Owners who are not spouses may not appoint contingent Beneficiaries. If both Joint Owners who were never spouses die before we pay the death benefit, we pay the death benefit to the estate of the Joint Owner who died last. If both spousal Joint Owners die simultaneously as defined by applicable state law or regulation, we pay the death benefit to the named contingent Beneficiaries, or to the estate of the spousal Joint Owner who died last if there are no named contingent Beneficiaries. Assignments, Changes of Ownership and Other Transfers of Contract Rights You can assign your rights under this Contract to someone else during the Accumulation Phase. An assignment may be absolute or limited, and includes changes of ownership, collateral assignments, or any other transfer of specific Contract rights. After an assignment, you may need the consent of the assignee of record to exercise certain Contract rights depending on the type of assignment and the rights assigned. You must submit your request to assign the Contract in writing to our Service Center and we must approve it in writing. To the extent permitted by state law, we reserve the right to refuse to consent to any assignment at any time on a nondiscriminatory basis. We will not consent if the assignment would violate or result in noncompliance with any applicable state or federal law or regulation. Upon our consent, we record the assignment. We are not responsible for the validity or effect of the assignment. We are not liable for any actions we take or payments we make before we receive your request in Good Order and record it. 1217 Assigning the Contract does not change, revoke or replace the originally named Annuitant or Beneficiary; if you also want to change the Annuitant or Beneficiary you must make a separate request. An assignment may be a taxable event. In addition, there are other restrictions on changing the ownership of a Qualified Contract and Qualified Contracts generally cannot be assigned absolutely or on a limited basis. You should consult with your tax adviser before assigning this Contract. 2. PURCHASE PURCHASE PAYMENTS We no longer accept additional Purchase Payments to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. The Purchase Payment requirements for Contracts issued in Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey are as follows. You can make additional Purchase Payments of $50 or more during the Accumulation Phase. You cannot make any additional Purchase Payments to the Contract after the Income Date that you take a Full Annuitization (including a required Full Annuitization on the maximum permitted Income Date). In certain states, additional Purchase Payments can only be made during the first Contract Year or may be otherwise restricted. The maximum total amount we accept without our prior approval is $1 million (including amounts already invested in other Allianz Life variable annuities). If you purchased this Contract as an Inherited IRA, the death benefit proceeds of the previous tax-qualified investment were directly transferred into this Contract (see section 9, Access to Your Money The Minimum Distribution Program and Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Payments). A beneficiary can apply the death benefit proceeds from multiple tax-qualified investments that were owned by the same owner to the purchase of an Inherited IRA Contract. We do not accept any other forms of Purchase Payment on an Inherited IRA Contract. The death benefit proceeds cannot be received by the beneficiary and then applied to an Inherited IRA Contract. For more information on Inherited IRA Contracts, see section 8, Taxes Qualified Contracts Inherited IRA. Purchase Payments to Qualified Contracts are limited by federal law and must be from earned income or a qualified transfer or rollover. Purchase Payments to Qualified Contracts other than from a qualified transfer may be restricted after the Owner reaches age 70½. We may, at our sole discretion, waive the minimum Purchase Payment requirements. We reserve the right to decline any Purchase Payment, and if mandated under applicable law, we may be required to reject a Purchase Payment. AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT PLAN (AIP) The AIP is no longer available to Contracts issued in all states except Connecticut, Florida, and New Jersey. The automatic investment plan (AIP) is a program that allows you to make additional Purchase Payments to your Contract during the Accumulation Phase on a monthly or quarterly basis by electronic transfer of money from your savings, checking or brokerage account. You may participate in this program by completing the appropriate form. Our Service Center must receive your form in Good Order by the 15th of the month (or the next Business Day if the 15th is not a Business day) in order for AIP to begin that same month. Investments take place on the 20th of the month or the next Business Day if the 20th is not a Business Day. The minimum investment that you can make by AIP is $50. You may stop or change AIP at any time. We must be notified by the first of the month in order to stop or change AIP for that month. If AIP is used for a Qualified Contract, you should consult your tax adviser for advice regarding maximum contributions. AIP is not available if the Qualified Contract is funding a plan that is tax qualified under Section 401of the Internal Revenue Code. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify AIP at any time and for any reason. AIP is not available if your Contract is funding a plan that is tax qualified under Section 401 or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or after the Income Date on which you take a Full Annuitization. 1318 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS We allocate your Purchase Payments to the Investment Choices you select. We ask that you allocate your money in whole percentages. Transfers of Contract Value between Investment Choices do not change the future allocation instructions. If you do not change your allocation instructions, we allocate any additional Purchase Payments according to your future Purchase Payment allocation instructions. You can only allocate up to 50% of any Purchase Payment to the FPAs during the Accumulation Phase. In some states, you cannot make allocations to the FPAs and they may only be available for GAV Transfers we make. In addition, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees, we may transfer more than 50% of the total Purchase Payments to the FPAs beginning on the second Contract Anniversary. You can change your future allocation instructions at any time without fee or penalty. Future allocation instruction changes are effective on the Business Day we receive them in Good Order at our Service Center. If you change your future allocation instructions and you are participating in the dollar cost averaging program or the flexible rebalancing program, this change does not automatically apply to your allocation instructions for these programs. We accept changes to future allocation instructions from any Owner unless you instruct otherwise. We may allow you to authorize someone else to change allocation instructions on your behalf. We reserve the right to limit the number of Investment Options that you can invest in at any one time. Currently, you can invest in up to 15 of the Investment Options at any one time. We may change this in the future; however, we always allow you to invest in at least five Investment Options. If you make additional Purchase Payments, we add this money to your Contract on the Business Day we receive it in Good Order. Our Business Day closes when regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes. If you submit a Purchase Payment to your Financial Professional, we do not begin processing the payment until we receive it. A Purchase Payment is received when it arrives at the address for mailing checks listed at the back of this prospectus regardless of how or when you submitted the payment. We forward Purchase Payments we receive at the wrong address to the last address listed at the back of this prospectus (1350 Energy Lane, Suite 200), which may delay processing. TAX-FREE SECTION 1035 EXCHANGES Subject to certain restrictions, you can make a tax-free exchange under Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code for all or a portion of one annuity contract for another, or all of a life insurance policy for an annuity contract. Before making an exchange, you should compare both contracts carefully. Remember that if you exchange a life insurance policy or annuity contract for the Contract described in this prospectus: you might have to pay a withdrawal charge on your previous contract, there is a new withdrawal charge period for this Contract, other charges under this Contract may be higher (or lower), the benefits may be different, and you no longer have access to any benefits from your previous contract. If the exchange does not qualify for Section 1035 treatment, you also may have to pay federal income tax, including a possible additional federal tax, on the exchange. You should not exchange an existing life insurance policy or another annuity contract for this Contract unless you determine the exchange is in your best interest and not just better for the person selling you the Contract who generally earns a commission on each sale. You should consult a tax adviser to discuss the potential tax effects before making a 1035 exchange. 1419 ACCUMULATION UNITS/COMPUTING THE CONTRACT VALUE Your Contract Value in the subaccounts (Separate Account Value) increase and decrease based upon the investment performance of the Investment Option(s) you choose. Your Contract Value is also affected by the charges of the Contract, any interest you earn on any general account Investment Choices, and any MVAs made due to amounts removed from the FPAs. In order to keep track of your Separate Account Value, we use a measurement called an Accumulation Unit. If you request variable Traditional Annuity Payments during the Annuity Phase of the Contract, we call this measurement an Annuity Unit. When we receive a Purchase Payment, we credit your Contract with Accumulation Units for any portion of your Purchase Payment allocated to an Investment Option at the daily price next determined after receipt of the Purchase Payment at our Service Center. The daily purchase price is normally determined at the end of each Business Day, and any Purchase Payment received at or after the end of the current Business Day receives the next Business Day s price. The Purchase Payments you allocate to the Investment Options are actually placed into subaccounts. Each subaccount invests exclusively in one Investment Option. We determine the number of Accumulation Units we credit to your Contract by dividing the amount of the Purchase Payment allocated to a subaccount by the value of the corresponding Accumulation Unit. Every Business Day, we determine the value of an Accumulation Unit for each subaccount by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value for the previous Business Day by the net investment factor for the current Business Day. We determine the net investment factor by: Adding declared distributions (daily interest, dividends, long term gains and short term gains) for an Investment Option to its net asset value (NAV). That result is then divided by the NAV the end of the prior business day to determine the overall daily performance in the Investment Option. That calculation is then multiplied by one minus the current Business Day s mortality and expense risk charge and any additional calendar days since the prior Business Day. We calculate the value of each Accumulation Unit after regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange closes each Business Day. The value of an Accumulation Unit may go up or down from Business Day to Business Day. We calculate your Separate Account Value by multiplying the Accumulation Unit value in each subaccount by the number of Accumulation Units for each subaccount and then adding those results together. (For example, the Contract Value on any Contract Anniversary reflects the number and value of the Accumulation Units at the end of the previous Business Day.) Example On Wednesday, we receive at our Service Center an additional Purchase Payment of $3,000 from you before the end of the Business Day. When the New York Stock Exchange closes on that Wednesday, we determine that the value of an Accumulation Unit for the Investment Option you chose is $ We then divide $3,000 by $13.25 and credit your Contract on Wednesday night with subaccount Accumulation Units for the Investment Option you chose. If the $3,000 payment had been received at or after the end of the current Business Day, it would have received the next Business Day s price. 1520 3. THE ANNUITY PHASE You can apply your Contract Value to regular periodic payments (Annuity Payments). A Full Annuitization occurs when you apply the entire Contract Value to Annuity Payments. A Partial Annuitization occurs when you apply only part of your Contract Value to Annuity Payments.* The Payee receives the Annuity Payments. You receive tax reporting on the payments, whether or not you are the Payee. We may require proof of the Annuitant(s) age before we make any life contingent Annuity Payment. If you misstate the Annuitant(s) age or gender, the amount payable is the amount that would have been provided at the true age or gender. * GMIB Partial Annuitizations are based on the GMIB value and are not available until the fifth Contract Anniversary and they are not available if the GMIB value is less than the Contract Value. INCOME DATE The Income Date is the date Annuity Payments (GMIB Payments or Traditional Annuity Payments) begin. Your scheduled Income Date in your Contract is the maximum permitted Income Date allowed for your Contract, which is the first day of the calendar month following the later of: a) the Annuitant s 90th birthday, or b) the tenth Contract Anniversary. Your scheduled Income Date may be different if the Contract is issued to a charitable remainder trust. An earlier Income Date or a withdrawal may be required to satisfy minimum required distribution rules under certain Qualified Contracts. You can make an authorized request for a different Income Date, but any such request is subject to applicable law and our approval. The extension available to you may vary depending on the Financial Professional you purchased your Contract through and your state of residence. Your Income Date must be the first day of a calendar month and must be at least two years after the Issue Date. Some states may require us to allow you to select an earlier Income Date. The Income Date cannot be later than what is permitted under applicable law. To receive the annuity income protection of the GMIB, your Income Date must be within 30 days following a Contract Anniversary beginning with the fifth Contract Anniversary (and certain other conditions must also be met). Your election to start Annuity Payments may involve an MVA if any of your Contract Value is in a FPA on the Income Date. NOTE: You must take a Full Annuitization of your total Contract Value on the maximum permitted Income Date if, at that time, your Contract Value is greater than zero. We base your Annuity Payments on your Contract Value. If you have not selected an Annuity Option we make payments under the default option described in the Annuity Payments discussion of this section. Upon Full Annuitization you no longer have a Contract Value, any periodic withdrawal or payments (other than Annuity Payments) stop, and the death benefit ends. In addition, if your Contract includes the Living Guarantees, the FPAs and the Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit are no longer available to you and you no longer receive any True Ups. TRADITIONAL ANNUITY PAYMENTS Annuity Payments offer a guaranteed income stream with certain tax advantages and are designed for Owners who are not concerned with continued access to Contract Value. You can request Traditional Annuity Payments under Annuity Options 1-5 as: a variable payout, a fixed payout, or a combination of both. We base Annuity Payments on your Contract Value. Under a fixed payout, all of the Annuity Payments are the same dollar amount (equal installments) except as provided under Annuity Option 3. Guaranteed fixed Traditional Annuity Payments are based on an interest rate and mortality table specified in your Contract. The payout rates for fixed Traditional Annuity Payments provided by your Contract are guaranteed and in no event do we use lower fixed payout rates to calculate your fixed Traditional Annuity Payments. However, we may use higher fixed payout rates to calculate fixed Traditional Annuity Payments than the guaranteed rates provided by your Contract. 16  View more

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 (202-551-8090).  Start Printed Page 51537

Applicants' Representations  
1. Allianz Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota. Allianz NY is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of New York.  
2. Allianz Account A is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-04965) and is used to fund certain variable life insurance policies issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account A is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific underlying registered investment company or portfolio thereof (each an “Investment Option”). Three variable life insurance contracts funded by Allianz Account A are affected by this application.  
Allianz Account B is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-05618) and is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz Life. Allianz Account B is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific Investment Option. Fourteen variable annuity contracts funded by Allianz Account B are affected by this application.  
Allianz Account C is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-05716) and is used to fund certain variable annuity contracts issued by Allianz NY. Allianz Account C is divided into a number of subaccounts, each of which invests in and reflects the investment performance of a specific Investment Option. Six variable annuity contracts funded by Allianz Account C are affected by this application.  
3. For purposes of the 1940 Act, Allianz Life is the depositor and sponsor of Allianz Account A and Allianz Account B, and Allianz NY is the depositor and sponsor of Allianz Account C, as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts. Each Separate Account meets the definition of a “separate account” in Rule 0-1(e) under the 1940 Act.    
4. The Contracts allow contractowners to allocate premium payments and transfer Contract value among the various subaccounts of the Separate Accounts. Of the 12 Contracts with effective and updated registration statements, eight offer all 78 Investment Options that are available under the Separate Accounts, two offer 74 Investment Options, one offers 73 Investment Options, and one offers 64 Investment Options. Two of these Contracts (known as Allianz Alterity and Allianz Rewards) have restrictions on the allocations that contractowners may make to the Investment Options if they select the optional Prime Plus Benefit. Under these Contracts, when certain risk or volatility limits are exceeded, allocations and transfers to certain Investment Options, including each of the Replaced Funds (as defined below), are limited or prohibited. The limits on allocations and transfers to the Replacement Funds (as defined below) under the Prime Plus Benefits are, and will be, no more restrictive than on the associated Replaced Funds.  
In most instances, up to 12 transfers may be made during each year free of charge (the year is measured by the date of issuance of the Contract). Under these Contracts, Insurance Company Applicants have reserved the right to charge a $25 fee (or the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred for certain Contracts) for each transfer in excess of 12 per Contract year. Since the Contracts are not designed for professional market timing organizations, or other persons using programmed, large, or frequent transfers, Insurance Company Applicants have reserved the right to restrict transfer activity that they determine to be excessive or inappropriate.  
5. Under the Contracts, Insurance Company Applicants reserve the right, subject to regulatory approval, to substitute one of the Investment Options with another Investment Option after appropriate notice. Moreover, the Contracts permit Insurance Company Applicants to limit allocation of purchase payments to one or more subaccounts that invest in an Investment Option. The prospectuses or statements of additional information for the Contracts also contain appropriate disclosure of these rights. Thus, subject to regulatory approval, the Contracts permit Insurance Company Applicants to stop accepting purchase payments into one or more Investment Options and/or to substitute the shares representing an Investment Option held in a subaccount for the shares representing another Investment Option.  
6. The Contracts are variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. Allianz Life currently issues individual deferred variable annuity contracts and has previously issued immediate variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies. Allianz NY issues individual deferred variable annuity contracts offered for sale in New York.  
7. Currently, Allianz Life has the following registration statements which are effective and updated with the Commission for Contracts sponsored by Allianz Account B that offer the Replaced Funds as Investment Options:

11. Applicants propose to substitute certain classes of shares of the AZL Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund, AZL S&P 500 Index Fund, and AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund (each a “Replacement Fund” and collectively the “Replacement Funds”) for certain classes of shares of the corresponding funds listed in the table below (each a “Replaced Fund” and collectively the “Replaced Funds”) currently held by the Separate Accounts.

(The Dreyfus Corporation)Initial Service.AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund (The Dreyfus Corporation)Class 2Dreyfus Investment Portfolios Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio (The Dreyfus Corporation)Service.
12. Each Replacement Fund is a series of the VIP Trust, a Delaware business trust. The VIP Trust is registered as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-9491) and its shares are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”) (File No. 333-83423).  
13. Each of the Replacement Funds, as well as all other funds offered by the VIP Trust, is managed by Allianz Investment Management LLC (“AZIM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz Life. AZIM is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (File No. 801-60167).  
14. The AZL Jennison 20/20 Focus Fund is assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan. Class 1 shares of the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, while Class 2 shares of the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets attributable to Class 2 shares, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan. The AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund is assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.  
15. Under the terms of a “manager of managers” exemptive order issued by the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 25734 (September 17, 2002), AZIM selects and manages subadvisers for the various series of the VIP Trust, subject to the oversight of the Board of Trustees of the VIP Trust, without obtaining shareholder approval (the “Manager of Managers Order”). The relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to all of the Replacement Funds. The Replacement Funds are offered to contractowners via prospectuses containing disclosure (1) describing the existence, substance, and effect of the Manager of Managers Order; (2) holding the Replacement Funds out to the public as employing the management structure described in the application for the Manager of Managers Order; and (3) explaining that AZIM has the ultimate responsibility (subject to oversight by the Board of Trustees of the Start Printed Page 51539VIP Trust) to oversee the subadvisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement. The Replacement Funds' prospectuses will be provided to each affected contractowner prior to the Substitutions.  
16. The Dreyfus Investment Portfolios Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio  (“Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio”) is a series of Dreyfus Investment Portfolios (“Dreyfus IP”). Service shares of the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.  
Initial shares of the Dreyfus Stock Index Fund, Inc. are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, while Service shares of the Dreyfus Stock Index Fund, Inc. are assessed a 12b-1 fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of average daily net assets attributable to Service shares, which is the maximum 12b-1 fee permitted under its distribution plan.

22. The following chart compares the management fees and the total operating expenses (before and after any waivers and reimbursements) for the year ended December 31, 2007, expressed as an annual percentage of average daily net assets, of the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund. As noted below, an expense cap will be in place for the AZL Small Cap Stock Index for two years from the date of the Substitution so that the Net Total Operating Expenses for the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund are expected to be no greater than for the Dreyfus IP Small Cap Stock Index Portfolio.

23. As a result of the Substitutions, the number of Investment Options under each Contract will either not be decreased, or, in those cases where the number of Investment Options is being reduced, continue to offer a significant number of alternative Investment Options. Specifically, the number of Investment Options is currently expected to range in number from 29 to 75 after the Substitutions versus 29 to 78 before the Substitutions.  
24. At the close of business on the day of the Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), Insurance Company Applicants will each redeem shares of the Replaced Funds held by their Separate Accounts in kind and apply the proceeds of such redemptions to the purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Funds. Thus, after the Substitutions, each subaccount of the Separate Accounts previously holding shares of a Replaced Fund will hold shares of the corresponding Replacement Fund.  
25. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that redemption of Replaced Fund shares and purchase of Replacement Fund shares will both occur at the price for such shares computed as of the close of business on the Substitution Date in a manner consistent with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. As a result, the full net asset value of the Replaced Fund shares held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the contractowners' Contract values following the Substitutions, without reduction for brokerage or other such fees or charges. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage Start Printed Page 51542commissions, will be paid by Insurance Company Applicants, or the manager of the Replacement Funds. Accordingly, Contract value attributable to contractowners then invested in the Replaced Funds will remain fully invested at all times, and the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contractowner's Contract value, death benefit, or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the applicable Separate Account.  
26. Affected contractowners will not incur any fees or charges in connection with the Substitutions so that the net asset value of redeemed shares of the Replaced Funds held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the contractowners' Contract values following the Substitutions. Moreover, neither the obligations of the respective Insurance Company Applicants under the Contracts nor the rights of contractowners will be altered in any way by the Substitutions. The Substitutions will not impose any tax liability or have any adverse tax consequences on contractowners. The Substitutions will not cause Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing owners of Contracts to be greater after the Substitutions than they were before the Substitutions. For a period of at least 30 days following the Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will not exercise any right it may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers except pursuant to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under the Contracts.6  
27. From the date that notice of the Substitutions was provided to affected contractowners by means of a prospectus supplement (the “Pre-Substitution Supplement”) through the date 30 days after the Substitution (the “Free Transfer Period”), the respective Insurance Company Applicants will allow the affected contractowners to make one transfer of Contract value held in each subaccount investing in the Replaced Funds (before the Substitutions) or Replacement Fund (after the Substitutions) to one or more Investment Options available pursuant to the Contracts without charge and without assessing transfer fees. Such a transfer also will not be counted as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge.  
28. Under the Manager of Managers Order, subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees of the VIP Trust, AZIM may retain one or more subadvisers for any fund of the VIP Trust without the approval of shareholders of the fund. However, after the Substitution Date, Insurance Company Applicants represent that AZIM will not retain any new subadviser for the AZL S&P 500 Index Fund and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order in connection with AZL S&P 500 Index Fund and the AZL Small Cap Stock Index Fund, without first obtaining shareholder approval of either: (1) the new subadviser, or (2) the fund's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order.  
29. Notice of the Substitutions and Free Transfer Period has been given to all affected contractowners by means of the Pre-Substitution Supplement for each of the Contracts stating that Applicants have filed the application and seek approval of the Substitutions. The Pre-Substitution Supplement sets forth the anticipated Substitution Date and advises affected contractowners that Contract values allocated to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replaced Funds will be transferred to subaccounts investing in shares of the Replacement Funds, without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge, on the Substitution Date. The Pre-Substitution Supplement states that, during the Free Transfer Period, affected contractowners may make one transfer of Contract value from each subaccount investing in a Replaced Fund (before the Substitutions) or a Replacement Fund (after the Substitutions) to one or more other subaccount(s), subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, without charge and without the transfer counting against any limitations on transfers. Further, prior to the Substitutions, all affected contractowners will receive a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Funds.  
30. Within five days following the Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will send a written notice to affected contractowners stating that the Substitutions were carried out and reiterating the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Supplement.  
31. For those who were contractowners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, Insurance Company Applicants will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the 24 months following the Substitution Date, those contractowners whose subaccount invests in any Replacement Fund such that the sum of such Replacement Fund's (a) operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements), net of any acquired fund fees and expenses, and (b) asset-based fees and charges for the Contracts for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the corresponding Replaced Fund's operating expenses (taking into account any fee waiver or expense reimbursement) and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Thereafter, expenses for the Replacement Funds will vary from year to year and may exceed those of the corresponding Replaced Funds.  
Applicants' Legal Analysis  
1. Applicants represent that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. Applicants note that the Commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.    
2. Applicants note the legislative history makes clear that Congress intended Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act to provide the Commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions that could otherwise, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both.  
3. Applicants assert that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act would not appear to have been designed to prohibit transactions like the Substitutions, in which a number of customer protections are provided, including the fact that the applicable unit investment trusts (the Separate Accounts) offer in excess of 63 different Investment Options.  
4. Applicants claim that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitutions are consistent with the principles and purposes of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act is designed to prevent. Contractowners will not be assessed charges in connection with the Substitutions and their annual fund net total operating expenses are expected to remain the same or decrease. In addition, to the extent a contractowner does not wish to participate in the Start Printed Page 51543Substitutions, he or she is free to make one transfer to any other option available under the relevant Contract at any time prior to the date of the Substitutions or during the 30-day period following the date of the Substitutions without any transfer fee and without that transfer counting as a transfer request under any contractual provisions of the Contracts that limit the number of transfers that may be made without charge. Moreover, the Contracts have features that Applicants believe provide adequate protection to contractowners. These features include:  
(1) A significant number of different Investment Options;  
(2) Investment Options that are reasonably diversified;  
(3) Investment Options that are reasonably seasoned;  
(4) Reasonable transferability between Investment Options;  
(5) Investment choices that include an option that is intended to reduce or eliminate fluctuation of principal; and  
(6) Reasonable liquidity in the form of free partial withdrawal rights.  
5. In addition, contractowners will be substituted into Replacement Funds whose investment objectives, principal investment policies, and risks Applicants believe will be substantially similar or virtually identical to those of the corresponding Replaced Funds, with net total operating expenses that are anticipated to be equal to or less than those of their corresponding Replaced Funds. Like the Replaced Funds which are not assessed a 12b-1 fee, their corresponding Replacement Funds will not be assessed a 12b-1 fee.  
6. In addition to substantially similar or virtually identical investment objectives, principal investment policies, and risks, as well as anticipated equal or lower net total operating expenses, Applicants maintain that the types of investment advisory and administrative services that will be provided to the Replacement Funds by their subadvisers will be comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services currently provided to the Replaced Funds by their respective investment advisers. Contractowners who become beneficial owners of the Replacement Funds as a result of the proposed Substitutions will enjoy continuity of their asset manager. These Replacement Funds will be managed by AZIM, but the asset management activity will be handled by the subadviser that currently manages the corresponding Replaced Fund.  
7. Moreover, because the Replacement Funds operate pursuant to the Manager of Managers Order, Applicants believe that the proposed Substitutions will provide protection to contractowners by giving AZIM the flexibility to change the subadvisers of the Replacement Funds should such a change become warranted or advisable. Thus, Applicants will provide contractowners with investment vehicles following the Substitutions that will be substantially similar to those offered prior to the Substitutions.  
8. In further support of their contention that the Substitutions do not present the type of costly forced redemption or other harms that Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act was intended to guard against and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act, Applicants note that the Substitutions will be subject to the following terms and conditions:  
(1) A contractowner may request that his or her Contract value be reallocated to another Investment Option, subject to any Investment Option allocation restrictions under their Contract, at any time during the Free Transfer Period without charge. The Free Transfer Period provides sufficient time for contractowners to reconsider their Investment Options;  
(2) The Substitutions will be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any transfer, brokerage or similar charge;  
(3) Neither the contractowners, the Replaced Funds, nor the Replacement Funds will bear any costs of the Substitutions, and all legal, accounting, and transactional costs and any brokerage or other costs incurred in the Substitutions will be paid by Insurance Company Applicants or the managers to the Replacement Funds, and accordingly, the Substitutions will have no impact on the contractowners' Contract values;    
(4) The Substitutions will in no way alter the contractual obligations of Insurance Company Applicants or the rights and privileges of contractowners under the Contracts; and  
(5) The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax benefits to contractowners.  
9. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c)  of the 1940 Act approving the Substitutions on the terms set forth in this Application. Applicants believe, for all of the reasons stated above, that each Substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.  
10. Section 17 Applicants also request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b)  of the 1940 Act exempting them from Section 17(a)  of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit Insurance Company Applicants to carry out the Substitutions by redeeming shares of the Replaced Funds in kind and using the proceeds to purchase shares of the Replacement Funds.  
11. Section 17(a)(1)  of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2)  of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above, acting as principal, from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company. Section 2(a)(3)  of the 1940 Act defines the term “affiliated person” of another person in relevant part as:  
(A) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, five per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of such other person; (B) any person five per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such other person; (C) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person; (D) any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such other person; (E) if such other person is an investment company, any investment adviser thereof or any member of an advisory board thereof; and (F) if such other person is an unincorporated investment company not having a board of directors, the depositor thereof.
12. Applicants may be considered affiliates of each of the Replacement Funds based upon the definition of “affiliated person” in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Shares of the funds of the VIP Trust are held solely by Separate Accounts. Because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company, Insurance Company Applicants, and their affiliates collectively, own of record all of the shares of the funds of the VIP Trust, including the Replacement Funds. Further, AZIM, an affiliated person of the VIP Trust by virtue of Section 2(a)(3) (E) of the 1940 Act, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz Life. For these reasons, the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are arguably under the control of Insurance Company Applicants notwithstanding the fact that contractowners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the Separate Accounts. If the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are under the control of Insurance Company Applicants, then Insurance Company Applicants, or any person controlling Start Printed Page 51544Insurance Company Applicants, or any person under common control with Insurance Company Applicants, is an affiliated person of the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds. Similarly, if the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are under the control of Insurance Company Applicants, then the VIP Trust and the Replacement Funds are affiliated persons of Insurance Company Applicants, and of any persons that control Insurance Company Applicants or are under common control with Insurance Company Applicants.  
At the close of business on the Substitution Date, Insurance Company Applicants will redeem shares of the Replaced Funds either in kind or in cash and use the proceeds of such redemptions to purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Funds, with each subaccount of the applicable Separate Account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the Replaced Funds in the applicable Replacement Funds. Thus, the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Replaced Funds to Insurance Company Applicants; immediately thereafter, Insurance Company Applicants would purchase shares of the Replacement Funds with the portfolio securities received from the Replaced Funds. This aspect of the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more sales by Insurance Company Applicants of securities or other property to the Replacement Funds. Accordingly, this aspect of the Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. Accordingly, Section 17 Applicants seek relief from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act for the in-kind purchases and sales of the Replacement Fund shares.  
13. Section 17 Applicants assert that any in-kind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the Substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the Replacement Funds. Subject to the oversight of AZIM, the subadvisers of each of the Replacement Funds will review the securities holdings of their corresponding Replaced Fund and determine which of the Replaced Fund holdings would be suitable investments for the corresponding Replacement Fund in the overall context of that Replacement Fund's investment objective and policies and consistent with their management of the Replacement Fund, and will accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction. Section 17 Applicants submit that these portfolio securities will be of the type and quality that the Replacement Funds would each have acquired with the proceeds from share sales had the shares been sold for cash.  
14. Section 17 Applicants state that any securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Funds to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued in accordance with the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios. The redeeming and purchasing values will be the same. Consistent with Rule 17a-7(d) under the 1940 Act, no brokerage commissions, fees, or other remuneration will be paid by the Replaced Funds or the Replacement Funds in connection with the in-kind transactions. If AZIM declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the Replaced Funds for purchase of in-kind shares of any of the Replacement Funds, those positions will be liquidated by the applicable Replaced Fund, and shares of the corresponding Replacement Fund will be purchased with cash.    
15. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act if the evidence establishes that: (1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records found under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.  
16. Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the Substitutions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The use of in-kind transactions will not cause contractowner interests to be diluted. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any contractowner's Contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the Separate Accounts. Contractowners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the Substitutions. Fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though they may not rely on Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act, Section 17 Applicants submit that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.  
17. The board of the VIP Trust has adopted procedures, as required by paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act (the “17a-7 Procedures”), pursuant to which the Replacement Funds may purchase and sell securities to and from their affiliates. Section 17 Applicants will carry out the proposed in-kind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the 17a-7 Procedures, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Nevertheless, the circumstances surrounding the proposed Substitutions will be such as to offer to each Replacement Fund the same degree of protection from overreaching that Rule 17a-7 provides to them generally in connection with their purchase and sale of securities under that Rule in the ordinary course of their business. In particular, Insurance Company Applicants (or any of their affiliates) cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to any of the Replacement Funds. Although the transactions may not be entirely for cash, each will be effected based upon (1) the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph (b) of Rule 17a-7, and (2) the net asset value per share of each fund involved, valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed transactions. The transactions will be reviewed by the Chief Compliance Officer of the VIP Trust, or his agents, and will be reported to the VIP Trust's Board of Trustees in the same manner as any other 17a-7 transaction by any of the Replacement Funds would be reported.  
18. Section 17 Applicants also submit that the in-kind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the policies of the Replacement Funds and the VIP Trust as recited in the current registration statements and reports filed by each under the 1940 Act.  Start Printed Page 51545

19. In addition, Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed in-kind portfolio security transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act as stated in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent. Further, Section 17 Applicants note that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the Replacement Funds to effect the contemplated in-kind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming Replaced Funds and purchasing Replacement Funds. Therefore, there will be no change in value to any contractowner as a result of the Substitutions.  
Conclusion  
Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above that the proposed Substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.
