FinTech Collective is a New York-based venture capital fund, focused exclusively on financial services technology companies. It was founded in 2012 by Brooks Gibbins and Gareth Jones, business partners of 16 years, to accelerate the re-imagination of financial services. Fintech Collective is one of the most active venture investors in fintech. We focus on Seed and Series-A companies, where the… · More most disruptive and innovative business models and technologies are being developed. We find companies through our network and have invested in less than 4% of the companies that we’ve done work on. We are highly differentiated in our ability to source deals and add value broadly across the financial services industry. While we invest in payments and banking, we also have a strong thesis and allocations across capital markets, wealth and asset management, lending, and insurance.
