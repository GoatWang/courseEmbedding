STANDING ORDERS

All Bloomberg BNA treatises are available on standing order, which ensures you will always receive the most current edition of the book or supplement of the title you have ordered from Bloomberg BNA’s book division. As soon as a new supplement or edition is published (usually annually) for a title you’ve previously purchased and requested to be placed on standing order, we’ll ship it to you to review for 30 days without any obligation. During this period, you can either (a) honor the invoice and receive a 5% discount (in addition to any other discounts you may qualify for) off the then-current price of the update, plus shipping and handling or (b) return the book(s), in which case, your invoice will be cancelled upon receipt of the book(s). Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that. Most importantly, standing orders mean you will never have to worry about the timeliness of the information you’re relying on. And, you may discontinue standing orders at any time by contacting us at 1.800.960.1220 or by sending an email to books@bna.com.

 Put me on standing order at a 5% discount off list price of all future updates, in addition to any other discounts I may quality for. (Returnable within 30 days.)
    

 Notify me when updates are available (No standing order will be created).

With clothes for men and women in standard and extended sizes, plus a full collection of clothes for babies and children of all ages, we've got all your clothing bases covered at Every Day Low Prices. You can meet all of your wardrobe needs in this section of our site; swimwear, cold weather gear, sleepwear, gym clothes, work outfits, tees and tank tops, jeans, suits, dresses, underwear, socks and more are all included in this department. Take in the full range of our clothing options by choosing "Shop All Clothing," or narrow down your options by choosing one of our specialized Clothing department sections or shops.Women's Clothing SectionsThe Women's Clothing department has several sections and shops to choose from. You can pick out your size range or the type of clothing you need to buy in order to focus in on the clothes you need. Special subcategories in the Women's Clothing department make it easier for women with particular clothing needs to find what they want. The Maternity section has specially designed and sized bottoms, tops, dresses, nursing clothes, activewear and leggings made especially for expectant mothers. Click into this section if you're expecting a little bundle of joy and need to update your wardrobe accordingly. Our Women's Plus section is suitable for women who prefer their clothes with a curvier cut in larger sizes, while the Women's Petite section is suitable for those ladies who find standard sizes too roomy or too long in the sleeve and leg.Men's Clothing SectionsMen have a few options to narrow down their clothing choices. The Men's Clothing department includes a full range of clothes for any occasion, time of day or season, and those men who find standard clothing sizes comfortable can find what they need in the main department sections. Men who are larger or taller than average can focus on the Men's Big & Tall section to find extended sizes in all of the same wardrobe essentials and extra elements found in the main Men's Clothing department.Clothes for KidsIt's easiest to shop for kids' clothes by focusing on the specific section that caters to their age or size range. The Baby & Toddler, Boys and Girls sections are further subdivided into categories for infants, toddlers, little boys and girls. The main children's clothing sections cater to boys and girls who are usually in elementary and middle school, though each kid may size out of these ranges at different points in their lives. We also have a Junior's section for girls who have outgrown the clothes in the girls' section but aren't yet ready for grown-up women's fashions. Young men in the same situation can find smaller sizes in the Men's Clothing department.Specialty Clothing ShopsYou can also shop based on occasion or activity if you have specific clothing needs and want to filter out all the items that aren't relevant. We have a Swim Shop with swimwear for every family member, age group and style need, and we also offer a separate Activewear section with athletic clothes for physical activity on dry land. You can find appropriate outdoor and safety clothes for women, men, girls and boys in the Hunting Shop, which has a variety of camo options and layering pieces to outfit everyone for family hunting activities. Adults and kids alike can show their enthusiasm for a sports team or pop culture franchise in our Sports Fan and Character shops, which offer tees, pajamas, hoodies, hats, jackets and other wardrobe pieces featuring the colors, logos and character designs you love.Other Wardrobe Items in the Clothing DepartmentYou can shop for much more than just clothing in this department; we also offer shoes, jewelry and other accessories. Like the other categories in Clothing, our shoes, jewelry, bags and other accessories are available in a range of styles and sizes for the whole family. You can stock up on dress shoes, school or work shoes, slippers and cold-weather boots by clicking into the appropriate shoe section for the person you're shopping for. Our Jewelry department, which you can access through the main Clothing department page, includes several different categories such as fashion jewelry, engagement and wedding rings, fine jewelry, watches and jewelry storage options. If you're looking for bags and other wearable accessories like belts and hats, you can take a look at the categories in our Bags & Accessories department, which is also accessible through the main Clothing department page. Find casual, everyday or athletic bags for kids and adults in the Backpacks section, or look for suitcases, handbags and briefcases in the Bags & Luggage section. You'll find all the additional accessories you need to finalize a formal or casual outfit in our Hats & Accessories section.

Overall:

Comfort:

Style:


The quality and style are nice. They felt snug when I put them on, but not enough to go up a size. I have worn them once and my feet hurt. The toe box is a bit narrow. I hope they break in. I am disappointed by the discomfort.

Nice looking shoe and exactly what I wanted. However, the size 8, which is what I normally wear, is way too small. I suggest ordering a half size up.

Style:


These shoes are beautiful and comfortable, but they run a bit on the small side. I'm normally between a 7 and a 7 1/2, closer to a 7, and in these I had to go up to the 7 1/2. They are nicely made, and the scalloped edge adds a nice touch. They have already become my every day shoes!

This are very uncomfortable in the toe box and they are brutal on a bunion. There isn't any padding on the insole either - they are more like moccasins. I found them to be true to size. One star because they are cute!

STANDING ORDERS

All Bloomberg BNA treatises are available on standing order, which ensures you will always receive the most current edition of the book or supplement of the title you have ordered from Bloomberg BNA’s book division. As soon as a new supplement or edition is published (usually annually) for a title you’ve previously purchased and requested to be placed on standing order, we’ll ship it to you to review for 30 days without any obligation. During this period, you can either (a) honor the invoice and receive a 5% discount (in addition to any other discounts you may qualify for) off the then-current price of the update, plus shipping and handling or (b) return the book(s), in which case, your invoice will be cancelled upon receipt of the book(s). Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that. Most importantly, standing orders mean you will never have to worry about the timeliness of the information you’re relying on. And, you may discontinue standing orders at any time by contacting us at 1.800.960.1220 or by sending an email to books@bna.com.

 Put me on standing order at a 5% discount off list price of all future updates, in addition to any other discounts I may quality for. (Returnable within 30 days.)
    

 Notify me when updates are available (No standing order will be created).
