BIRMINGHAM, Ala. and HANOVER, Pa., July 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Golden Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:    GLDC) and Utz Quality Foods, Inc. of Hanover, PA ("Utz") announced that they entered into a definitive merger agreement on July 18, 2016, pursuant to which Utz will acquire the Company and Company stockholders will receive $12.00 per share in cash. This price represents a premium of approximately 71 percent over the Company's 30-day average closing trading price of $7.00.
 








"After conducting a review of strategic alternatives by a Special Committee consisting of independent members of the Company's Board of Directors, we believe that this is an excellent transaction for our stockholders, our customers and our employees," said Mark McCutcheon, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.   "This merger will allow the Golden Flake brand to continue to grow in our core southeastern markets, while expanding the product selections for our consumers.  Utz is a very community oriented company and we look forward to the future that Utz and Golden Flake will create together."
Utz Quality Foods, Inc. is a privately held snack food company, founded in 1921 by William and Salie Utz.  They began making potato chips out of their home in Hanover, in much the same way Frank Mosher, Mose Lischkoff and Helen Freidman began Golden Flake in 1923.   The Bashinsky family began their snack food legacy when they purchased the business in 1946.  During their tenure the Company grew from a small local operation to the multi-state corporation it is today.
"We are excited about the opportunity to partner with Golden Flake," said Dylan Lissette, Chief Executive Officer of Utz. "The two companies are very similar both in mission and values, and each has a team of dedicated associates. Golden Flake's product line, market coverage, and manufacturing facilities blend well with Utz's desire to expand and grow our markets in the south."  Both management teams recognize the value of the "plus one strength" gained from the synergies of each company.  The Golden Flake product lines and production capabilities will complement the Utz product portfolio, which includes Utz, Zapps, "Dirty", Bachman, Wachusett, Snikiddy and Good Health.
"Our company has viewed Golden Flake as a leader in the industry.  Their culture, quality line of products, and dedicated people, through the vision and leadership that Mr. Bashinsky established, is a wonderful fit within our company," said Mr. Lissette. Golden Flake will operate as a separate subsidiary under the leadership of its current management team and continue to be an important part of Birmingham as "The South's Original Potato Chip!"
Subject to antitrust approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Following the execution of the merger agreement, stockholders representing a majority of the voting shares of Golden Enterprises delivered a written consent approving and adopting the merger agreement.  The merger agreement includes a three-day period during which the Company's Board can consider an unsolicited alternative proposal that it concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and the financial advisor) is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company than the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement.
North Point Advisors, LLC acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Golden Enterprises.  Sirote & Permutt, PC acted as legal counsel to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of Golden Enterprises.  Sandler O'Neill acted as financial advisor to Utz.  Cozen O'Connor acted as legal counsel to Utz.
NOTE: This press release contains forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include the possible benefits of the proposed Golden Enterprises acquisition to the Utz business. Readers are directed to Golden Enterprises' periodic and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a description of such risks and uncertainties. Neither Golden Enterprises nor Utz undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

    The South's Original Potato Chip
  

How one hard working company captured people’s hearts (and stomachs).



Scroll to learn more






 1854


The Potato Chip is Born.
As the story goes, George Crum, a cook at Moon’s Lake House in Saratoga Springs, New York, tries to appease a customer who keeps complaining that his potatoes are too thick. Frustrated with repeated complaints from the same customer, Crum slices the potatoes razor thin, fries them until they’re crisp, and serves them up. The customer is thrilled. The potato chip is born.







You’ll find an old brass plaque hanging in our offices with the Golden Rule on it, and its been around as long as anybody can remember.







 1923


Magic City Food Products.
Frank Mosher, who came to Birmingham from Memphis, seeks out a partner to start a potato chip company that will ultimately become Golden Flake. Mosher knows how to make potato chips. All he needs is money. He finds his financial partner in Mose Lischkoff. The company launches in the basement of a Hill’s Grocery Store in north Birmingham.














 1924


Helen Friedman comes on the scene.
At this time, in addition to their principle product – potato chips, the company packages horseradish as well as peanut butter cracker sandwiches which are hand made and wrapped by hand as well. Mosher hires Helen Friedman to help out.




 1928



          The Roaring Twenties.        



Mosher and Helen Friedman become romantically involved. Meanwhile, Mose Lischkoff decides that he could run the company better and offers to buy Mosher out, figuring that Mosher still didn't have the finances necessary to buy the company. Mosher goes to Helen and she and her mother loan him the money to buy out Lischkoff instead.







 1928













 The Golden Flake Girl
Frank Mosher and Helen Friedman marry and she becomes Helen Friedman Mosher. By this time, everybody knows Magic City Food Products’ potato chip as “Golden Flake” and Helen as “The Golden Flake Girl.”


A marriage sputters and a company finds its stride.

In the late 20s through early 40s a lot happens. Helen’s marriage to Frank ends. But Helen’s association with the company continues in a big way as she receives the entire company in the divorce settlement. Under Helen’s leadership, the company reaches sales of nearly one million dollars over the next couple of decades.



















 1940's


The Golden Flake girl moves on.
By this time, Helen Friedman Mosher has married again to become Helen Friedman Mosher Gregg. Here, just after the end of World War II Helen sells Magic City Food Products to the Bashinsky family.







The company moves from the basement of the grocery store to a facility on Lomb Avenue.







In addition to all of the things that affect the flavor and texture of our products, our Quality Control team even uses a special machine that measures the color. You can’t have a Golden Flake chip that doesn’t have that rich golden Golden Flake color!







Changes to name and ownership.
Sloan Bashinksy, son and nephew of the owners, has worked his way up in the company from route sales and production jobs. He buys the company from his uncle and father and changes the name of the company to Golden Flake, Incorporated.




 1957


New digs are underway.
Sloan initiates the construction of the 50-acre Birmingham corporate headquarters and an extensive manufacturing facility.





Thanksgiving Weekend, 1958.
The company moves from Lomb Avenue into its present location. There is much to be thankful for.







We have a state-of-the-art water processing plant. All of the water we use passes through the plant and is returned to the environment cleaner than it was when it first came into our plant!







 1960's



          Great Pair, says the Bear        



A pair made in snack heaven
Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant, a close friend of Sloan Bashinsky becomes Golden Flake’s most revered spokesperson. During his show, he is always seen with a Coca-Cola and a bag of Golden Flake potato chips. “Great Pair,” says the Bear becomes a popular slogan.




















COACH FRIENDS EVERYWHERE
Golden Flake isn’t just a University of Alabama friend. In fact, a number of SEC coaches are seen promoting our delicious chips. We even began sponsoring Auburn University around this time.




 1960's





FROM PIGSKIN TO PORK SKINS
During the Bear Bryant era, Golden Flake adds pork skins to the team.







 1960's








At Golden Flake, we reuse the cartons in which we ship our products, which saves both money and trees!







A PUBLIC OFFERING
Looking to give his customers and employees an opportunity to own part of the growing company, Sloan Bashinsky takes Golden Flake public.




 1970's


THE GOBBLER COMES ON THE SCENE
Before The Muppets ever hit the scene, Jim Henson, then a relative unknown, created the Gobbler for us. The Gobbler lasted until moms decided they didn’t like a monster that ate everything, even if he was a very friendly monster!















A TRULY GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY
Golden Flake turns 50 and celebrates by adding our delicious Golden Flake Tortilla Chips to the lineup. By this time, we are already producing a corn chip that wins taste tests over its competitors.




 1990's



          IN A PICKLE        
Golden Flake becomes one of the first snack food companies to produce a dill pickle flavored chip. Our competitors scramble to follow suit as the flavor gains popularity.







At one point in our history, in addition to potato chips, Golden Flake made prepared horseradish. Apparently, horseradish was very popular way back when!







 1990's





SWEET HEAT IS A HOT NEW ITEM
Arguably the most popular Golden Flake chip takes the market by storm. To this day, there’s not another chip like it in the market.












TALLADEGA TRACK SPONSOR
That’s right. Golden Flake becomes one of the first sponsors for Talladega Super Speedway.





 1998









THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY
Golden Flake celebrates its 75th Anniversary.





 2015





POPCORN POPS IN
Golden Flake adds popcorn to its list of excellent products.





Our tractor trailers are custom designed to carry the maximum number of Golden Flake cartons.






 That's All!
