Micro Cap Insider, Small Caps




Steampunk Wizards Inc (OTCMKTS:SPWZ) started trading in August at just over $1 per share after the name change from Freedom Petroleum Inc. and 2.5 for 1 reverse stock split in July. Starting slowly at first the stock has transformed into one of the top traded stocks on the entire bb’s.
Clearly SPWZ is a significant promotion in the early days as the stock continues to average $250,000 plus in daily trading volume.
Steampunk Wizards Inc (OTCMKTS:SPWZ) bills itself as an independent games development and technology company specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the real and virtual worlds blur, with headquarters in Los Angeles, California.
On August 25 SPWZ announced the launch of its latest game, Bungee Mummy: Challenges. This is a free-to-play collection of casual mini-games on the Company’s Bungee Mummy game theme.
Bungee Mummy: Challenges: Bungee Mummy: Challenges offers players a series of different mini-games. Each one requires a different skillset, ability and style of gameplay, whether it is tap and shoot, bungee launch, swing with precision or swipe to cut and drop. The game could be compared to cross between Spiderman, Angry Birds and Cut the Rope in terms of its gameplay. The difficulty of the Challenges picks up momentum as the player advances. Save your friends! Smash the snakes! Master the Wheel of Misfortune! And see how you rank on the weekly leaderboards!
Bungee Mummy: Challenges is a continuation of the theme from Bungee Mummy: King’s Escape, an adventure puzzler game which will be relaunched in the coming weeks on Mobile (iOS and Android) and PC (via Steam). In King’s Escape players are offered the chance to win real-life 3D printable rewards.
Bungee Mummy: Challenges was created to give players the opportunity to use King Phero in different ways and to practice their skills for the larger, adventure game.
“Through our analysis of Bungee Mummy: King’s Escape we were impressed with how players took advantage of our realistic gameplay system to complete levels and handle obstacles in ways we had not foreseen. We decided to release the true potential of Phero and created Challenges- a game for every style of gameplay with more to come. We are launching four Challenges now, and more will be added in the near future,” said Anton Lin, CEO of Steampunk Wizards.

SPWZ also said once early download and user-retention results are received from Bungee Mummy: Challenges, the company will execute the advertising strategy for the game. At the same time this information will be used to optimise the relaunch of the main Bungee Mummy franchise game, King’s Escape. While King’s Escape is already available for free download to the general public, a modified version may be released in September, and this version would be accompanied by robust advertising strategy.
On July 30 just as the stock began to trade the Company announced effective July 30, 2015, pursuant to corporate actions undertaken by the Company and the resultant name change, its trading symbol has changed from FPETD to SPWZ. The Company’s stock began trading on the OTC Markets under its new symbol as of market opening on Wednesday July 29, 2015.
The Company is also pleased to announce that following the closing of a ‘Definitive Share Exchange Agreement’ entered on July 15, 2015, it is in the final stages of acquiring Steampunk Wizards Ltd. (“the Subsidiary”). Following the completion of the acquisition, Steampunk will own 100% of the Subsidiary, including a development office in Malta with seven employees and two contractors as well as the IP and full development and publication rights of all games owned by the Subsidiary now and in the future. The closing is expected to occur on or about August 7, 2015.

Currently trading at a $50 million market valuation SPWZ has little assets, no revenues to date and rising debt. The stock is making spectacular gains and has transformed into one of the top traded stocks on the exchange. The stock being liquidated into the campaign is likely the 10,080,000 (as adjusted for the 2.5 for 1 reverse split from July) acquired at just $0.0015 pre reverse. Short term SPWZ could easily move much higher, long term the Company lacks fundamentals and could drop big from current levels. We will be updating on SPWZ when more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with SPWZ.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

Steampunk Wizards, Inc. To Launch New Game – Names Joshua O’Cock as Chief Executive Officer

STEAMPUNK WIZARDS, INC. – LOS ANGELES, February 9, 2016 – Steampunk Wizards, Inc. (OTCQB:SPWZ) announced today that it has submitted a new game to iOS and Android for general release.
The game, Neon Gliders, is the fourth to be released by Steampunk Wizards in the last three months. It is an endless runner style game in which players must glide for as long as possible without crashing into various obstacles. As players collect gems, the in-game currency, they are able to use them to unlock new gliders. In-game currency can also be purchased to fast track this process.
The company is in discussion with international game publishers to co-publish its new game, Neon Gliders, aiming at expansion into new and larger markets.
Additionally, the Company announced that effective January 29, 2016, Joshua O’Cock has been named President and Chief Executive Officer. Anton Lin has resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer of Steampunk Wizards, after overseeing the successful entrance of the Company into the gaming sector and the smooth acquisition of a European subsidiary company.
Mr. O’Cock joined Steampunk Wizards, Ltd., the Malta-based subsidiary of Steampunk Wizards, Inc., as its Chief Marketing Officer in 2014. Prior to joining Steampunk Wizards, Mr. O’Cock served as Chief Marketing Officer for a 3D-printing company in Malta. Previously he held communications and marketing positions for London based companies, in both the arts and beverages sectors.
Mr. O’Cock graduated from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management and IT, and holds a Masters Degree in Information Systems, Organisations and Management from the University of Manchester Business School. After completing his Masters Degree, he spent two years working for the University of Manchester, running social media marketing.
Mr. Lin commented, “Josh has a great background in marketing and social media, which is just what Steampunk Wizards needs at this stage to develop a brand for itself and publicize its games as widely as possible. Since the acquisition of Steampunk Wizards, Ltd., our Malta based subsidiary in mid-2015, the Company has released 3 games, while one more game will be available next week. Our fan base is growing quickly and I believe that now is the perfect time for a marketing specialist, with a tremendous experience in the gaming industry, to take over and grow the brand. I am proud of our achievements in the last year, as we have now built a company well poised for growth; I am confident that Josh will be able to maximize that potential.”
Mr. O’Cock commented, “It is a great honor to be named Chief Executive Officer of Steampunk Wizards. The valuable experience I have gained since 2014 as the Company’s Chief Marketing Officer provides me with an excellent understanding of the many opportunities that lie ahead. I will continue to work closely with our the excellent group of designers, product developers, and senior management team to capitalize on these growth opportunities. I look forward to reporting on our progress in the coming months.”
