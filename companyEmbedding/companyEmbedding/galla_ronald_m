This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

TIPS
Everyone loves a home where the kitchen is sparkling, floors gleaming and the bathrooms dry & shining. But as a homemaker you know keeping a home clean & neat is a never ending job. Not anymore. Gala's Handy Cleaning Tips take the hard work out of the cleaning, making it an easy task.





Floor, Ceilings & Walls


To remove oil or grease stains from a polished wood floor, add two tablespoons vinegar to half a liter of warm water and wipe.
Avoid cleaning flooring tiles with harsh detergents or acids. These elements can rob the shine off your floor.
Add a dash of detergent and disinfectant to the water to keep it germ free & spotless.
For sparkling window panes and mirrors, rub them with a slice of lemon and wipe dry with a soft cloth.
Wash ceilings before cleaning walls and floors to prevent dirt from falling onto them.
To remove crayon marks from walls, wipe them with a cloth or sponge dampened with spirit.





Bathrooms


To unclog the showerhead, dip it in a bowl of vinegar for 4 hours. The acid will help clear the dirt.
Clean bathroom rods regularly and wipe clean with a dry soft cloth.
Bathroom floors are vulnerable to moss growth. Sprinkle some bleaching powder and let it stay for 10 mins. Wash clean.
Chemical toilet cleaners will ruin the finish of bath tubs; opt for non chemical based cleaners.






Kitchen


Apply a little common salt to the inside of the freezer compartment to prevent the formation of ice crystals.
To clean the clogged sink, mix a handful of sodium bi carbonate and one cup of vinegar and pour it into the wash basin followed by water.
Put some table salt in your mixer and run it for a few seconds. Do this once in a month to keep your mixer blades sharp.
Clean kitchen sink with a toothbrush while cleaning tough stains and grime around the corners of the sink.
To clean a clogged tea strainer, heat it over a gas flame before cleaning it up post it cools down.
