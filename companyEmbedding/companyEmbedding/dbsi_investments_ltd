FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, April 10, 2013 
DBSI Principals Indicted For Securities Fraud, Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, Bank Fraud And Conspiracy
             BOISE – Douglas L. Swenson, 64, of Eagle, Idaho; Mark A. Ellison, 64, of Boise, Idaho; David D. Swenson, 35, of Boise, Idaho; and Jeremy S. Swenson, 40, of Meridian, Idaho, were indicted today by a federal grand jury in Boise for conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, and interstate transportation of stolen property stemming from their involvement in the DBSI Group of Companies (DBSI), U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho Wendy J. Olson announced. Defendant Douglas Swenson is the founder and former President of DBSI. Mark Ellison, another founder of DBSI, served as DBSI’s general counsel during the period charged in the indictment. David D. Swenson and Jeremy S. Swenson were assistant secretaries for DBSI. Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Meridian, Idaho, DBSI was essentially a conglomerate of real estate and non-real estate companies, including DBSI Housing and DBSI Securities. According to the indictment, from January 2007 through November 2008, the defendants publicly represented that DBSI was a profitable company and had a net worth in excess of $105 million. The indictment further alleges that the defendants knew and believed that, contrary to the disclosures made to investors and their own DBSI employees involved with the marketing and selling of DBSI investments, DBSI’s real estate and non-real estate business activities were universally unprofitable; DBSI’s much-touted Master Lease investment product was losing approximately $3 million dollars a month; and DBSI was relying on new investor funds, including investor money that DBSI represented would only be used in particular circumstances, to continue operations and pay returns to other DBSI investors. The indictment alleges that the conspiracy continued until DBSI filed for bankruptcy in November 2008. The eighty-three count indictment also charges all of the defendants with thirty-nine counts of securities fraud, thirty-four counts of wire fraud, six counts of interstate transportation of stolen property taken by fraud, and two counts of bank fraud. Former President Douglas Swenson is also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. Based on the conspiracy and fraud charges, the indictment seeks forfeiture of properties and assets totaling $169 million. According to the indictment, DBSI purported to be an industry leader in locating, acquiring, developing, managing and providing real estate investment opportunities throughout the United States. The criminal allegations center around material omissions, as well as false and fraudulent representations, made to investors about investment products that involved tenant-in-common 1031 exchange interests (TIC investments) and the related “Master Lease” investment product. DBSI promoted the Master Lease, whereby DBSI leased back commercial real estate that it first sold to TIC investors, as providing investors with a reliable, fixed monthly return on their investment, backed by the financial support and substantial net worth of DBSI. Also according to the indictment, although the defendants knew of DBSI’s true and deteriorating financial position, they withheld accurate financial information and took steps to conceal DBSI’s true financial condition from investors, financial advisors, broker dealers, due diligence officers, DBSI wholesalers, and other DBSI employees. The indictment alleges that in disclosures to investors, the defendants falsely and fraudulently misrepresented DBSI Housing’s net worth; failed to disclose DBSI’s cash shortages and deteriorating finances; misrepresented the likelihood of repayment on large investments in technology start-up companies; and failed to disclose DBSI’s dependence on new investor money to meet its existing obligations. The indictment further alleges that, as part of its Master Lease investment product, DBSI collected funds called “Accountable Reserves” from investors. The indictment alleges that although DBSI told investors that their Accountable Reserves would only be used for specific expenses associated with their TIC properties and not co-mingled with other DBSI funds, the defendants conspired to and did in fact commingle and divert at least $80 million in investor’s Accountable Reserves for purposes other than those disclosed to investors, including payment of the promised fixed investment returns to existing investors, operation expenses, and investments in technology start-up companies. The defendants are also charged with defrauding investors of approximately $89 million dollars from a 2008 notes offering, based on disclosures that misrepresented assets on DBSI Housing’s balance sheet. These assets included account receivables from affiliated DBSI entities, which were made up of more than $200 million in loans to technology start-up companies. The indictment alleges that the four defendants conspired to conceal the investments in, and DBSI’s dependence on, more than $200 million in loans to technology start-up companies, which were made through DBSI affiliated entities. The indictment further alleges that defendants took steps to conceal these loans, which were treated as fully collectible, despite DBSI having received no prior material repayments and there being no likelihood of any future material repayments. According to the indictment, the fraud and conspiracy charges involved the non-public offerings for multiple commercial real estate investment projects in, among others, six different states: Virginia, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota and Texas. The bank fraud charges arise out of projects in Georgia and Illinois, in which DBSI originally obtained financing from financial institutions in order to purchase commercial real estate, which it then repackaged and resold to TIC investors. The indictment alleges that the defendants made false and fraudulent statements in order to secure those loans. In a related case, former DBSI Chief Operating Officer Gary Bringhurst pleaded guilty in federal court in Boise on Monday, April 8, 2013, to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Bringhurst, 46, is originally from Utah. According to the plea agreement, Bringhurst conspired to mislead DBSI investors by, among other things, falsifying financial statements for DBSI Housing. The plea agreement further states that one of the properties about which DBSI made false and fraudulent representations was Oakwood Plaza, LLC, in Alton, Illinois. “Investment fraud undermines markets, bilks investors of promised returns and creates unnecessary loss at a time when our economy is struggling to recover,” said Olson. “Those who seek to induce others to invest their hard earned money in complex financial deals have a solemn duty to act with honesty and integrity. I commend the hard work and detailed investigation of the FBI and IRS agents who have spent countless hours on this case.” “Defrauding investors is like a ‘house of cards’; the underlying structure can fall apart at any time leaving many investors in financial ruin,” said Stephen Boyd, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent-in-Charge for the State of Idaho. “IRS CI along with our law enforcement partners will vigorously pursue corporate officers who victimize their investors and violate the public trust.” The conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge is punishable by up to twenty years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release. The securities fraud charges are each punishable by up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release. The wire fraud charges are each punishable by up to twenty years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release. The bank fraud charges are each punishable by up to thirty years in prison, a maximum fine of $1 million, and up to five years of supervised release. The interstate transportation of stolen property charges are each punishable by up to ten years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to one year of supervised release. The false statement charge is punishable by up to two years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to one year of supervised release. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistants United States Attorney George Breitsameter and Anthony Hall, and Department of Justice Tax Division Trial Attorney Mark Williams. An indictment is a means of charging a person with criminal activity. It is not evidence. The person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. Today's announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF), which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. attorneys' offices and state and local partners, it's the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations. Over the past three fiscal years, the Justice Department has filed more than 10,000 financial fraud cases against nearly 15,000 defendants including more than 2,700 mortgage fraud defendants.

About the District
 
The United States Attorney's Office for the District of Idaho was created in 1863 when Idaho became a territory. On March 10, 1863, Richard Williams was appointed the District's first U.S. Attorney by President Abraham Lincoln.
Several of the early U.S. Attorneys were not Idaho residents. They arrived from eastern states having never seen Idaho prior to their appointments. Unlike today, when the U.S. Attorney is paid an annual salary, early U.S. Attorneys earned a nominal fee for each case they handled. In order to make a living, many of them maintained their own private practices at the same time.
Since the Office's founding in 1863 there have been 28 Presidentially-appointed U. S. Attorneys, many of whom have had notable careers. Joseph W. Huston served as Chief Justice of the Idaho Territorial Supreme Court. Willis Sweet served as an associate justice of the same court, and was one of the founders of University of Idaho. He was later elected to Congress. James H. Hawley was one of the most distinguished figures in Idaho history and tried more criminal cases than any other lawyer in the Northwest. The most famous was the prosecution of three men charged with the murder of former Idaho Gov. Frank Steunenberg, in which Hawley went up against Clarence Darrow. Hawley eventually became Governor himself, and authored a three-volume history of Idaho. Fremont Wood, the last U. S. Attorney for the Territory of Idaho and the first U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho after statehood, was the presiding judge in the Steunenberg case. John A. Carver, blind from the age of five, served as U.S. Attorney for 20 years, then as a District Court Judge. These colorful and distinguished personalities contributed much to the State of Idaho.

DBSI Inc.
DBSI Inc., an Idaho-based commercial real estate investment company, is facing questions from investors after becoming insolvent. DBSI based much of its business on Tenants in Common (TIC) investments. In 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) amended rules so that investors could avoid capital gains tax by investing proceeds from a property sale into TIC investments.  TICs allow individuals to become fractional owners of a single property. Unlike other legitimate TIC investments, DBSI appears to have been involved in circumspect activities.
Between 2003 and 2008, investors poured approximately $1 billion into DBSI's TIC investments.  However, regulatory questions have been raised concerning the nature of TIC investments.  There has been debate as to whether TICs should be classified as real estate investments or securities products.  DBSI sold both types of offerings concurrently, thereby creating a legal quandary for many investors now that the company is in bankruptcy.
For those TICs sold as securities products, intermediary broker-dealer firms who ultimately sold the product were required to conduct due diligence prior to selling the investment and conduct ongoing monitoring thereafter. At the very least, broker-dealers must perform due diligence on financial statements, perform background checks on key persons, and assess the value of any underlying real estate. There existed a myriad of issues that ultimately led DBSI to its current predicament, systemic issues that seem to have existed for some time.
It appears that DBSI began encountering liquidity issues as early as 2004. By 2005 this shortage created an earnest need for new investor funds in order to maintain current operations. Part of maintaining operations included paying off older investors. Unlike other TIC investment deals, DBSI guaranteed a 7% dividend to investors. In order to make these payments to investors amid chronic cash shortages, DBSI appears to have created two schemes. The two alleged scheme include:

Hidden Markups - DBSI would buy a commercial property at a given price and then sell it to new investors at a profit. The amount of the markup was not disclosed in many cases; a violation of securities law provided the properties were sold as a security. One disturbing characteristic of this practice was the amount of time between DBSI buying an investment property and selling it to investors; sometimes it was as short as one day. 
"Accountable Reserves" - Beginning in 2005, every new DBSI project had an accountable reserves fund that set aside money for tenant improvements and repairs. In actuality, only 18% of the money in those funds went towards tenant improvements and repairs. The other 82% of the over $99 million available in accountable reserves went towards other DBSI funds. 

Even with the abovementioned schemes DBSI was not able to maintain a financially viable enterprise. By 2007, the company was losing $3 million a month on its properties. That number increased to $8 million by 2008. Despite years of losing money, investors were only issued warnings on their investments six weeks prior to the company filing bankruptcy.
In the aftermath of DBSI's bankruptcy filing, state investigators began looking into the actions of the company. The bankruptcy court in Delaware appointed an examiner, Joshua Hochberg, to conduct a detailed analysis of the company aimed at determining its actions prior to becoming insolvent. He is charged with tracking more than $3 billion in DBSI transactions in an attempt to discover the location DBSI resources.
To date it has been discovered that company insiders bilked more than $75 million since 2000, over $35 million going to CEO Douglas Swenson. According to Hochberg, Swenson is the only member of DBSI's management who is refusing to answer questions.  Following a threat to compel him to submit to questioning, Swenson presented a letter stating that he would exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if forced to answer questions about DBSI.

DBSI Principals Indicted for Securities Fraud, Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, Bank Fraud, and Conspiracy









U.S. Attorney’s Office


April 10, 2013








District of Idaho
(208) 334-1211













BOISE—Douglas L. Swenson, 64, of Eagle, Idaho; Mark A. Ellison, 64, of Boise, Idaho; David D. Swenson, 35, of Boise, Idaho; and Jeremy S. Swenson, 40, of Meridian, Idaho, were indicted today by a federal grand jury in Boise for conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, and interstate transportation of stolen property stemming from their involvement in the DBSI Group of Companies (DBSI), U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho Wendy J. Olson announced.
Defendant Douglas Swenson is the founder and former president of DBSI. Mark Ellison, another founder of DBSI, served as DBSI’s general counsel during the period charged in the indictment. David D. Swenson and Jeremy S. Swenson were assistant secretaries for DBSI. Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Meridian, Idaho, DBSI was essentially a conglomerate of real estate and non-real estate companies, including DBSI Housing and DBSI Securities.
According to the indictment, from January 2007 through November 2008, the defendants publicly represented that DBSI was a profitable company and had a net worth in excess of $105 million. The indictment further alleges that the defendants knew and believed that, contrary to the disclosures made to investors and their own DBSI employees involved with the marketing and selling of DBSI investments, DBSI’s real estate and non-real estate business activities were universally unprofitable; DBSI’s much-touted Master Lease investment product was losing approximately $3 million dollars a month; and DBSI was relying on new investor funds, including investor money that DBSI represented would only be used in particular circumstances, to continue operations and pay returns to other DBSI investors. The indictment alleges that the conspiracy continued until DBSI filed for bankruptcy in November 2008. The 83-count indictment also charges all of the defendants with 39 counts of securities fraud, 34 counts of wire fraud, six counts of interstate transportation of stolen property taken by fraud, and two counts of bank fraud. Former president Douglas Swenson is also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Based on the conspiracy and fraud charges, the indictment seeks forfeiture of properties and assets totaling $169 million.
According to the indictment, DBSI purported to be an industry leader in locating, acquiring, developing, managing, and providing real estate investment opportunities throughout the United States. The criminal allegations center around material omissions, as well as false and fraudulent representations, made to investors about investment products that involved tenant-in-common 1031 exchange interests (TIC investments) and the related Master Lease investment product. DBSI promoted the Master Lease, whereby DBSI leased back commercial real estate that it first sold to TIC investors, as providing investors with a reliable, fixed monthly return on their investment, backed by the financial support and substantial net worth of DBSI.
Also according to the indictment, although the defendants knew of DBSI’s true and deteriorating financial position, they withheld accurate financial information and took steps to conceal DBSI’s true financial condition from investors, financial advisors, broker dealers, due diligence officers, DBSI wholesalers, and other DBSI employees. The indictment alleges that in disclosures to investors, the defendants falsely and fraudulently misrepresented DBSI Housing’s net worth; failed to disclose DBSI’s cash shortages and deteriorating finances; misrepresented the likelihood of repayment on large investments in technology start-up companies; and failed to disclose DBSI’s dependence on new investor money to meet its existing obligations.
The indictment further alleges that, as part of its Master Lease investment product, DBSI collected funds called “Accountable Reserves” from investors. The indictment alleges that although DBSI told investors that their Accountable Reserves would only be used for specific expenses associated with their TIC properties and not co- mingled with other DBSI funds, the defendants conspired to and did in fact commingle and divert at least $80 million in investor’s Accountable Reserves for purposes other than those disclosed to investors, including payment of the promised fixed investment returns to existing investors, operation expenses, and investments in technology start- up companies.
The defendants are also charged with defrauding investors of approximately $89 million dollars from a 2008 notes offering, based on disclosures that misrepresented assets on DBSI Housing’s balance sheet. These assets included account receivables from affiliated DBSI entities, which were made up of more than $200 million in loans to technology start-up companies. The indictment alleges that the four defendants conspired to conceal the investments in, and DBSI’s dependence on, more than $200 million in loans to technology start-up companies, which were made through DBSI-affiliated entities. The indictment further alleges that defendants took steps to conceal these loans, which were treated as fully collectible, despite DBSI having received no prior material repayments and there being no likelihood of any future material repayments.
According to the indictment, the fraud and conspiracy charges involved the non-public offerings for multiple commercial real estate investment projects in, among others, six different states: Virginia, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, and Texas. The bank fraud charges arise from projects in Georgia and Illinois in which DBSI originally obtained financing from financial institutions in order to purchase commercial real estate, which it then repackaged and resold to TIC investors. The indictment alleges that the defendants made false and fraudulent statements in order to secure those loans.
In a related case, former DBSI Chief Operating Officer Gary Bringhurst pleaded guilty in federal court in Boise on Monday, April 8, 2013, to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Bringhurst, 46, is originally from Utah. According to the plea agreement, Bringhurst conspired to mislead DBSI investors by, among other things, falsifying financial statements for DBSI Housing. The plea agreement further states that one of the properties about which DBSI made false and fraudulent representations was Oakwood Plaza LLC in Alton, Illinois.
“Investment fraud undermines markets, bilks investors of promised returns and creates unnecessary loss at a time when our economy is struggling to recover,” said Olson. “Those who seek to induce others to invest their hard earned money in complex financial deals have a solemn duty to act with honesty and integrity. I commend the hard work and detailed investigation of the FBI and IRS agents who have spent countless hours on this case.”
“Defrauding investors is like a ‘house of cards’: the underlying structure can fall apart at any time, leaving many investors in financial ruin,” said Stephen Boyd, IRS-Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge for the state of Idaho. “IRS-CI, along with our law enforcement partners, will vigorously pursue corporate officers who victimize their investors and violate the public trust.”
The conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, and interstate transportation of stolen property charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release. The conspiracy to commit money laundering charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release. The securities fraud charges are each punishable by up to five years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to three years of supervised release. The wire fraud charges are each punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to five years of supervised release. The bank fraud charges are each punishable by up to 30 years in prison, a maximum fine of $1 million, and up to five years of supervised release. The interstate transportation of stolen property charges are each punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to one year of supervised release. The false statement charge is punishable by up to two years in prison, a maximum fine of $250,000, and up to one year of supervised release.
The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation. The case is being prosecuted by Assistants United States Attorney George Breitsameter and Anthony Hall, and Department of Justice Tax Division Trial Attorney Mark Williams.
An indictment is a means of charging a person with criminal activity. It is not evidence. The person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
Today’s announcement is part of efforts underway by President Obama’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF), which was created in November 2009 to wage an aggressive, coordinated, and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. attorneys’ offices, and state and local partners, it is the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory, and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud. Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state, and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets; and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions, and other organizations. Over the past three fiscal years, the Justice Department has filed more than 10,000 financial fraud cases against nearly 15,000 defendants including more than 2,700 mortgage fraud defendants.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
