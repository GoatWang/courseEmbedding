Why Onit










Why Onit
Unmatched Agility & Intuitive Interface
Onit Smart Process Apps are user-friendly, easily adapt to changing process demands and provide insight into business processes on the whole. Enterprise software and BPM solutions often demand users to change their habits, requires days or hours of training and are notoriously difficult and expensive to upgrade or customize after implementation.
Onit Smart Process Apps are lightweight, easily customizable by the end-user and offer a level of flexibility that is absent in enterprise software. Onit Smart Process Apps can be configured in days and business teams can be up and running quickly. This quick set-up and deployment is possible with little to no IT involvement.
Smarter Collaboration
Onit Smart Process Apps excel in facilitating collaboration – an aspect that is increasingly growing and an integral part of business processes. Business teams, clients and vendors collaborate seamlessly in a shared workspace, where they can discuss ideas, review notes and documents, comment on the contributions of others and define next steps and deadlines. All members also have access to a history of activities so nothing gets lost or misplaced.
Unprecedented Transparency
Onit Smart Process Apps provide transparency into normally opaque processes. In most companies, simple processes like contract review, NDA requests, sales quotes, new legal matters and employee onboarding consume inordinate amount of staff and management time.
This is often the case because these documents (i.e. contracts, transactions, pricing sheets, etc.) move between disparate silos such as email and shared drives and are stored and managed in multiple locations. Onit Smart Process Apps automate these manual, cumbersome, and often paper intensive processes, while giving team members visibility throughout the process. Flexible routing and re-routing capabilities let authorized participants makes changes to the workflow and add approvers as necessary.
Business teams remain in control of all aspects of the process – from tracking to reporting to management dashboard views.

Budgets, Bandwidth & Business Process: A Corporate Legal Department&' Guide to Strategic Alignment
Today's corporate legal department faces constant pressure around budgets, bandwidth and process efficiency. Recognizing the need to become less a cost center than a valued business partner, many corporate legal departments are looking for innovations in productivity, better ways to control costs and are, in some scenarios, turning to third party providers in an effort to demonstrate greater strategic alignment. This opening panel examines the corporate legal department’s decision making process when dealing with such multifarious issues of efficiency. Pivoting upon personal experience and lessons learned, our accomplished panel will discuss how to master these complex-and essential-business decisions.
This session will also lead participants through an exercise in identifying a work process/product that could achieve significant strategic alignment through modifications in process efficiency.

A Better Way to Run Legal Operations: The Enterprise Legal Management Paradigm Shift is Now.
For nearly two decades, enterprise legal management (ELM) has focused on matter management and spend management. It’s fair to say that effective ELM platforms were, and still are, good at what they do best – only matter and spend management.
There has been a distinct paradigm shift and evolutionary branching off from those older ELM systems. Today, the most effective ELM platforms facilitate engagement, are focused on “process,” offer an environment where the user experience is crucial and can be augmented to manage other legal processes. Today’s definition of ELM includes all of the following tasks — contract management, legal service requests, NDAs, and legal holds (to name a few).
This session will highlight how innovative legal departments have acknowledged the evolutionary ELM paradigm shift and have implemented solutions to get ahead of the curve.

Breakout Session: Next Generation Enterprise Legal Management (ELM): People. Process. Automation.
For nearly two decades, enterprise legal management (ELM) has focused on transactional solutions, like matter management and spend management. Many legal departments find themselves struggling under the weight of legacy technologies that simply do not work or are expensive to upgrade.
The 21st century, version 3.0, of ELM is about business process automation. ELM should not simply be data capture but a true system of engagement that underlies and supports all the key processes of the law department such as legal spend management, contract management, legal service requests, NDAs, legal holds and much more.
PayPal and Onit will discuss how legal departments can provide "continuous" value to the company, drive operational improvements and allow employees to work in the systems they prefer. The session will highlight:

The importance of process, workflow and collaboration
How a business automation tool solves needs beyond e-billing and matter management
Key benchmarks and metrics that drive innovation and transformation in legal operations

Onit Emerging Technology Session: A Better Way to Run Legal Operations: The Enterprise Legal Management Paradigm Shift is Now
For nearly two decades, enterprise legal management (ELM) has focused on transactional solutions, like matter management and spend management. More recently, there has been a distinct paradigm shift and evolutionary branching off from those older ELM systems and the limited application they saw. Today, the most effective ELM platforms facilitate engagement broadly across the company, tying legal to its internal clients and extended global team. 21st century platforms are focused on “process,” offer an environment where the user experience is crucial and can be augmented to manage other legal processes beyond matter and spend management. Today’s broader definition of ELM includes all of the following tasks —contract management, legal service requests, NDAs, and legal holds (to name a few). This session will highlight how innovative legal departments have acknowledged the evolutionary ELM paradigm shift and have implemented solutions to get ahead of the curve and to better and more broadly carry out the mission of the law department in a more complex world.

What are Onit Apps?


Onit Apps were designed to help business and legal teams become more efficient at what they do so they can streamline operations, control costs, gain visibility into projects and reduce company risk. They were designed to solve relatively simple business problems like contract review and approval, NDA requests, employee on-boarding, etc. 



What is the Onit Platform?


The Onit platform is a fusion of three distinct components that drive efficiency and productivity in all areas of business. Our platform combines business process management, collaboration, communication and project management into one tool, allowing business teams to make informed decisions. 



What are Onit Legal Apps?


Onit Legal Apps are ideal for legal departments that need to reduce legal spend and gain financial transparency into legal projects and matters. Our apps are a powerful combination of project management, business process management, electronic invoicing and matter management tools. Whether you need a comprehensive tool or a single solution, we can customize an app to fit your business needs. 



Who can benefit using Onit's apps?


Onit's apps are ideal for business users looking for a tool to automate manual processes without the assistance of IT. Our monthly subscription plans are affordable and there is no need to download software to get started. 



What are the advantages of using Onit?


Business and legal teams using Onit can efficiently share information and communicate with others both inside and outside the firewall. Onit provides an instant, effective, and simple method for tracking progress on projects, deals, transactions, cases, and litigation. You can also actively manage your team's status, update your personal status and respond faster to your team. 



Who should use Onit?


Onit can be used by ANY legal and business professional to manage projects and automate business processes. For many customers, Onit is a compelling alternative to expensive or complex collaboration software tools or legal spend management products. 



How is Onit unique?


Onit offers a lean, agile solution for legal and business professionals that don't necessarily need all the heavy and rigid components of traditional project management software. Onit is a lighter approach to project management that encourages team collaboration with internal and external groups. Onit combines project management with legal spend management so you can make better informed business decisions. 



Is Onit easy to use?


Yes. Updating project status with Onit is a lot like updating personal status on Facebook or Twitter. 



Do I need to install or download any software to use Onit?


No. Onit is 100% web-based. There is no software to install and no long deployment or implementation cycle. You can collaborate with colleagues within minutes of registering. 



Is my data secure and private with Onit?


Onit meets the highest standards of enterprise class security. Our hosting partner is SAS 70 Type II Certified, which is the most secure certification possible. The data you enter in Onit belongs to you and will never be sold or shared. Read more about our security measures, click here. You can also review our Privacy Policy. 



How do you get started with Onit?


An Internet browser and an e-mail address is all you need to register. Collaborating on legal and business projects can begin as soon as you register and invite your colleagues. 



Is there a limit to the number of projects you can create in Onit?


No. You can create as many projects as you like in Onit. A project in Onit is a secure work space where business teams can come together and share information. Instead of emailing project and team information to the entire group, Onit centralizes project information so users can share files, manage documents, assign tasks and share status updates. 



What are the system requirements to use Onit?


The only system requirements to use Onit are an Internet browser. Internet Explorer (versions officially supported by Microsoft) and the latest versions of FireFox, Safari and Chrome are all compatible with the system. 



Is training necessary to get started with Onit?


No. Onit was designed with users in mind so the interface is simple to use. If you are a new Onit user, we recommend taking a few minutes to watch some of the screencasts. 



What are the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy?


The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy can be accessed online.

Customer Support








Comments:  Onit has proven a great partner both in terms of its product features and the customer service support the Onit team provides.  Onit provides a very nimble product that can be quickly modified and adapted for various business needs.  This is not the case with the other products we considered in this space.  My experience of Onit is that they are motivated not only to sell their product at the outset but to continue to improve the product and ensure customer success in the adoption and use of the product.  It's been a great experience so far.

Comments:  I love the Onit Apps!  I seem to find most of my problems can be solved with an Onit App.  They are very easy to get set up and the customer support team is great at responding quickly and making updates as we identify changes we need.  
We were manually tracking data in excel files and our different departments had different excel files that didn't match up.  Our file was never up to date and anytime we needed metrics we had to go through a 3 day effort to try to pull the information together from systems and the excel file. Now we integrate with the system and hold the data all in our Onit App AND the other department uses it to interact with us so we can all be looking at the same information.
It has improved our intake process too.  We have recently found that other departments are now asking us for access to the information we have in there because it is so valuable!
The reporting tools are still a work in progress for them but we can easily get all the data we need out of the system to create any reporting we need.  
Great product!  Great team of people.  I highly recommend!

Comments:  Home Depot, in conjunction with Onit developed several contract intake apps in order to streamline our process for contract review requests coming into the legal department.  Previously we had no formal process for our client to request legal services relating to reviewing and negotiating contracts.  Now with our intake app, our clients can simply fill out an easy to use on-line form which provides us with all the necessary information in order to generate a new contract or review any addendums, etc. relating to an existing contract.  They can also attach existing relevant documents.  That request is then sent to the legal department where an attorney is assigned the matter and the review begins.  All communications with our clients are through the Onit app eliminating emails and keeps all communications in one central location as it relates to that particular contract.  
This has been an exceptional process improvement for our client communications, reporting metrics and speed in which we can turn around contracts.  Our client have embraced this new process and use it daily.

The Home Depot is an invaluable Onit partner. We are thrilled to know that we provide them with this kind of value!
