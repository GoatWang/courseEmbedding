All shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus are being registered 
for the account of the selling stockholder. We will not receive any of the 
proceeds from the sale of these shares.


The key element in purchase decisions made at Motivating The Masses client level
is trust in the professional reputation and reliability of the professional 
development firm. The professional development industry is pulverized and 
disorganized, with thousands of smaller consulting organizations and individual
consultants for every one of the few dozen well-known companies. Competitors 
range from major international name-brand consultants to tens of thousands of 
individuals. One of our challenges will be establishing itself as a complete 
professional development company, creating "other" experts the client trust 
outside of Lisa Nichols while creating trust and confidence at the same level 
on a consistent basis. When dealing with the small or entrepreneurial business 
market, cost or price will be one of the greatest obstacles Motivating The 
Masses Programs will face.  It will be up to us to assist our clients in the 
discovery of how much it may cost them NOT to pursue professional development 
and establish Motivating The Masses Programs as the most effective solution to 
their challenges. With time, reputation and referrals will allow for a steady 
stream of new clients as well as regular price increases. This is not a business
to build brand as much as it is to build reliability. 

However, we believe the most unique benefit that Motivating The Masses Programs
offer to clients is the ability to experience ongoing, reinforcement 
development, versus a typical "one-time" seminar format. Motivating The 
Motivating the Masses Programs provide development and support for a year or 
more. Since each strategic workshop client will be immediately qualified for 
one-on-one coaching, we will manage and monitor the specific progress of each 
client to ensure appropriate development.


Company Description
Motivating the Masses was formed in the State of Nevada on September 2, 1998 to
engage in providing top-quality professional development and coaching services.
The Company will provide it’s professional development services in the most 
effective manner and with an ongoing effort to provide 100%


 client satisfaction
(collectively, the "Motivating the Masses Programs"). Management believes that 
the Motivating the Masses Programs and initiation of the following key 
procedures will enable it to reach its goals: (i) creation of a unique, upscale,
innovative environment that will differentiate Motivating The Masses Programs 
from other coaching or professional development businesses; (ii) educating the 
business community on what business and strategic coaching has to offer; (iii) 
formation of a learning environment that will bring people with diverse 
interests and backgrounds together in a common forum to overcome challenges both
professionally and personally; (iv) affordable access to the resources of 
business coaching and other consulting services; (v) training and developing 
key individuals to leverage the Company's trainings, coaching programs and 
platforms; and (vi) hiring the executive team. 

The Company plans to use its existing contacts and customer base to generate
both short and long-term coaching contracts. Its long-term profitability will
rely on professional contracts obtained through strategic alliances, a
comprehensive marketing program and a successful referral program. The Company
has focused on professional development, strategic workshops, one-on-one
coaching and special project relationships.  The Company's expansion will
provide a separate and comprehensive coaching, mastermind session, and online
membership services.
