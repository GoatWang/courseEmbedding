C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mark, and good morning. I will begin with a summary of our second quarter performance, make some observations about the current market conditions and outlook and talk about our plan for Forum going forward. And then, I will turn it over to Jim who will discuss our financial results and liquidity position, followed by Prady who will address our business improvement and operational excellence initiatives.
Although oil prices have improved from the very low levels in the first quarter of 2016, industry activity in Q2 reached extremely depressed levels as evidenced by the 35% drop in the average North America rig count from the first quarter. The low level of drilling and completions activity resulted in lower volumes for us, but just a 10% decline in our revenue to $143 million in the second quarter. Our net loss per share was $0.19 excluding special items.

The steps we have taken to reduce our cost structure and improve our operating efficiency are working. We continue to streamline our cost structure and as a result, we were able to hold our decremental margins to just 13% in the second quarter. With these cost and efficiency initiatives, we believe we could achieve incremental margins of as much as 50% in the early stages of a recovery.
Despite the very challenging environment, we strengthened our financial position during the second quarter. Forum generated free cash flow after capital expenditures of $16 million during the second quarter. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability but also allows us to pursue disciplined acquisition and product development strategies.
Forum's total inbound orders during the second quarter were $128 million, a 9% decrease from the level in the first quarter. The second quarter book-to-bill ratio was 90% for the company as a whole; 85% for the Drilling & Subsea segment; 114% for the Completions segment; and 84% for the Production & Infrastructure segment. The rig count continued its decline during the quarter, and our service company customers remained reluctant to spend on anything that is not absolutely necessary.
This further destocking of their inventory of consumable items should lead to pent-up demand for our products. In our production equipment product line, orders were up 17% in the second quarter as operators made plans to complete their backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells. We continue to see improved quoting activity for our well side surface production equipment.
Orders for subsea equipment were up sequentially as we received an order to supply three remotely operated vehicles for a multipurpose ice-class vessel. The order includes two Perry work class ROV systems and one Sub-Atlantic observation class ROV.
When oil prices approached $50 in the second quarter, we saw an increase in inquiries as customers put drilling rigs back to work. As we now look ahead to the third quarter, we expect our orders to increase and our financial results to be in line with or slightly better than the second quarter level, provided oil prices are not less than last quarter's $45 average.
There are market indications that this historical down cycle has bottomed, although the timing and pace of a true recovery are not yet clear. Forum's strong balance sheet, cash flow and leverage to North America drilling and completions, consumable products and our improved cost structure and operational capability all position us well for the market upturn.
Our plans for Forum going forward are geared around preparing for the upturn, as Prady will describe. We have our streamlined organization and facility plan in place, and we have redeployed resources to emphasize business development and a focus on our early cycle businesses. We are also busy working on potential acquisition opportunities that would complement and expand our existing businesses.
Let me ask Jim to take you through our financials and our balance sheet position. Jim?
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Cris, and good morning, everyone. I will summarize our results for the quarter comparing the second quarter 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Consolidated revenue of $143 million for the second quarter was down 10% sequentially in line with our expectations as global drilling and completions activity levels continues to decline. Our Drilling & Subsea segment revenue of $57 million was down 13% due to the decline in working drilling rigs and lower demand for subsea robotics and equipment.
The Completions segment revenue of $25 million declined 29% sequentially due to lower well construction and completions activity in North America. Our Production & Infrastructure segment revenue of $62 million was up 2% on increased sales of valves to the midstream gas transmission industry, partially offset by lower surface production equipment deliveries in the United States. The net loss for the second quarter was $29 million or $0.31 per diluted share. The quarter included special items totaling $19 million on a pre-tax basis.

The adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was $0.19 per diluted share. The special items were comprised of pre-tax charges of $29 million for inventory reserves, restructuring charges and other items partially offset by $10 million in currency translation gains.
Our second quarter adjusted operating loss was $23 million, excluding special items compared to an adjusted operating loss of $21 million from the first quarter. Our decremental operating margins of 13% for the quarter on the reduced revenue were better than our guidance of a percentage in the 20%s are we are benefiting from our cost reduction and efficiency initiatives. At these significantly lower industry activity levels, our revenue is even lower than our 2016 plan. Our evaluation of inventory conducted at the end of 2015 was based on the 2016 plan. We reevaluated all of our inventories according to our excess and slow-moving policy guidelines in light of the current slower moving environment. Most of the $25 million addition to the inventory reserves is attributable to the mechanical application of this policy overlaid by management judgment where we deemed appropriate.
We generated $16 million of free cash flow in the second quarter which includes operating cash flow, less capital expenditures net of PP&E sales proceeds, but before acquisitions. Our cash balances did not increase as much as this free cash flow would indicate primarily because of the impact of exchange rates at the end of the quarter on our non-U.S. cash balances and the acquisition consideration. We expect to use non-U.S. cash to cover local costs and investments in those respective currencies and therefore, there is no economic impact.
We have demonstrated our ability to continue to generate free cash flows throughout the downturn. At these lower activity levels, however, we are liquidating our inventories at a slower pace, and we will not have the continued benefit of reducing accounts receivable as the business stabilizes. We now expect to generate about $20 million of free cash flow over the second half of 2016. As activity levels pick up in the recovery, we should benefit from the opportunities to sell more out of our existing inventory stock.
Drilling & Subsea recorded an adjusted operating loss of $12 million; Completions, $8 million; and Production & Infrastructure had adjusted operating income of $4 million. On these extremely low plant volumes, we are continuing to experience labor and overhead absorption issues but we believe that maintaining the current capability will be critical to our response to the upturn. We expect incremental operating margins to be higher than normal in the early stages of the recovery as the load on our plants increases and we achieve better absorption of these costs.
Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 90.7 million shares. Net debt at the end of the second quarter was $259 million, bringing our debt to total capitalization ratio to 17.8%. Interest expense was $6.8 million in the second quarter. Corporate expenses were $6.7 million and we expect corporate expenses to continue to be around $7 million per quarter.
Capital expenditures were $5.8 million in the quarter, offset by $3.4 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Our 2016 CapEx budget remains approximately $20 million which is sufficient for maintenance and select investments. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15.7 million in the quarter and should be similar throughout 2016.
Our effective tax rate on the second quarter loss was 42.6% and our estimated annual effective tax rate is now 38%. The higher effective tax rate is attributable to losses incurred in the U.S. and benefited at a higher statutory rate, offset by earnings outside the U.S. taxed at lower rates.

For more information about our financial results, please review the earnings release on our website.
I will now turn the call over to Prady to update you on several of our initiatives. Prady?
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I will discuss the progress we made during the quarter in positioning Forum to take advantage of a market recovery including the streamlining of our operations, product development and new market penetration.
With the consolidation of our operations having been substantially completed by the end of first quarter, we are now seeing the full benefit of our efforts in the company's second quarter results with decremental margins of 13% versus the previous quarter results. As an example of our consolidation efforts, we have now achieved an approximately 25% reduction in our global manufacturing footprint without sacrificing manufacturing capability and have gained similar significant efficiencies in other areas of our operations.
In terms of our procurement initiative, we are on track for a year-end savings rate of 15% to 18% compared to 2014 pricing levels. As a result, the procurement savings will be substantial enough for choosing volumes increase during the recovery, and we believe there will significant additional saving opportunities in the coming years. We are making good progress on lean and value engineering across the company. And even at these reduced activity levels, we expect significant savings in 2016.
We also continued to streamline our organization structure and have completed the consolidation of our Completions segment by combining the stimulation and intervention in downhole product lines under one executive leader. Similar to our consolidation of the Production & Infrastructure segment during the first quarter, we believe this new structure will provide greater focus on customer synergies and operational efficiencies.
In addition, we have simplified and resized the organization of our subsea product line. Although this products line continues to execute backlog, gain market share and diversifying to non-oil and gas markets, we are expecting a slower recovery in this area for business which is in line with offshore market trends.
These initiatives will significantly reduce our permanent cost structure. We expect that the benefit of the company will be magnified as activity increases, positioning Forum for high incremental margins in the eventual recovery.
Now, I would like to discuss our investments. In the Middle East, our new commercial organization and product development. We believe these focus areas will increase our market share and revenue. I recently visited several countries in the Middle East and I'm excited about our opportunities in the region. Our focus in the Middle East over the next few quarters will be on evaluating and developing manufacturing operations in Saudi Arabia in order to allow us to localize the products and qualify them with NOCs, national oil companies, and build our sales team in the region. We believe there's an opportunity to more than double the company's market share over the next three to four years.
We also recently appointed an executive leader for strategic marketing and business development with responsibility across all product lines. This newly-created position will be responsible for strategic marketing and account management to improve our market share with current customers and develop new customers globally and will lead our entry into new markets.
Another area of focus for us is new product development. As the market turns and activity picks up, we expect this aspect of our business to continue to be one of our predominant areas of investment. We plan to introduce about 20 new products in 2016. And I already introduced several new products year-to-date. One example of a recently introduced product that is gaining significant interest from our customers is our innovative frac missile trailer.

This new trailer has a single large diameter with high pressure piping and 70% fewer connections. These features increase reliability and durability and significantly reduce the operating cost for our customers. Another example is our drilling product lines, 7,500 psi mud pump upgrade package that continues to gain momentum with the customers as they plan to upgrade rigs to handle longer lateral wells and higher pressures required in today's drilling environment.
I'm pleased with our team's work in all the focus areas I've discussed, and believe that our efforts will help differentiate Forum and significantly improve the company's market presence during the recovery. Now, I'll hand it back it to – I'll now turn the call over to Cris for – moderate Q&A.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Prady. I want to recognize the entire team at Forum for their hard work and determination which has allowed us to reduce our cost structure very significantly and improve our efficiency. The impact of these changes is evident in our second quarter results with our excellent performance on decremental margins and continued strong cash flow. Forum is well-positioned at this point in the market cycle. We have much exposure to the early cycle Completions business and to the upturn in North America activity. We are not burdened by high exposure to the offshore deepwater market or a need to wait for the next capital build cycle. I like our position. At this point, we will open the line for questions. Neesy?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of George O'Leary from Tudor. Your line is open.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, George.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Impressive quarterly results and the 0.9 times book-to-bill stood out. But in your commentary highlighting the 114% book-to-bill in the Completions segment was particularly interesting. Any incremental color on what within the Completions segment was really the driver there? Was it more on the downhole side i.e., Bridge Plug type products or more consumable equipment associated with pressure pumping spreads? Just curious on what drove that impressive book-to-bill?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I think the book-to-bill ratio was actually higher in the pressure pumping consumable. As some of our customers, as they talked about in our conference calls, are putting some equipment back to work now. They are of course very concerned about the pricing in their business, and that puts a lot of information on their cash flow. So, they're still cautious in their spending and holding off until they absolutely need to spend. But it is a case that they have now gotten to the point where they need to – they have a stable or increasing level of activity, which is going to drive more utilization and more need for replacement products. But it was not just in the stimulation and intervention product line, the downhole business also had a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 100%.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
That's very helpful color. Thank you. On the Middle East, I heard there was some interesting commentary from you, Prady. I guess, talking about breaking further into that Saudi market, could you discuss a little bit or help frame for us kind of what the size of that market is to you guys from a revenue or from an earnings standpoint just so we can understand how much kind of a doubling in penetration over a three- to four-year period would mean for Forum?
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer

Yeah. I'll talk specific to Saudi, George, and then I'll expand on the Middle East region. I think our focus in Saudi Arabia right now over the next few quarters is primarily how do we localize our manufacturing operation to take advantage of some of things which the Kingdom is trying do to get some local content into Saudi Arabia and – which gives you also a preferential treatment from a pricing standpoint. So, we would like to take advantage of that and we are evaluating our options of how do we set the manufacturing operation in Saudi Arabia. You got to go through the approval processes and all that, which we're going through as we speak.
But speaking of the region in general, we expect to double our market share in the Middle East. I mean this year, probably, we'll do about $50-plus million in the region in the Middle East. And we can easily double our market share over the next three to four years. I think over the next two quarters, our priorities are how do we get all the products qualified in the region through the NOC process, which is a pretty long process. And then, once the products get qualified, I think we'll start gaining our market share.
And I think we can easily double our market share. Maybe there's more opportunity. But we are evaluating as we speak. We need to put a lot of boots on the ground. We are working through all that as we speak.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. That's really helpful color. Maybe if I can just sneak in one more. The cost improvements in the decrementals were really solid in the second quarter. And it sounds like you have the roofline situation essentially complete at this point. So, if I heard you right, it sounded like Q3 revenues could be sort of flattish quarter-on-quarter given the cost side of the equation. Could there be some margin improvement or were you also guiding sort of expectations at the EBITDA or operating income line flattish quarter-on-quarter? Just want to make sure I have that all squared away.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
The activity level remains the way it was in the second quarter. One of the things which Cris talked about is as long as the oil price was at a $45 average and the activity remains at that level, with the revenue which is what we expect to be about flattish versus second quarter. We do expect to see some margin improvement in third quarter, primarily because of all the cost actions we've taken. And as Jim mentioned, we do expect our incrementals to be higher.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. That was very helpful. Thanks for the color, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Very good.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is open.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Cris. Just getting back on that Completions business. Can you just talk about kind of – I think most of your kind of short cycle U.S. exposure is in that business. Has anything kind of changed in your outlook from the last quarter? If I recall correctly, you've been talking about kind of a year-end inflection point year-end kind of pick up in that. Has anything kind of changed in your outlook so far?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, David. When we talk about our short cycle activity based businesses that are early to pick up, let's not lose sight of the production equipment business within our Production & Infrastructure segment. That's probably the first one to pick up because operators need to place the orders for that equipment in advance of bringing on a new well on production. And that's why we did see a pickup, a handsome pickup in orders in that product line during the second quarter, and we expect that trend to continue.

If operators are going to complete these docks, our business is kind of analogous to a well head, meaning you cannot complete that well without having that well site production equipment. So, that was I think a bright spot in Q2 and one we expect going forward and is an early indicator for us. Yes, you're right about our pressure pumping consumables and other completion products. But those are – don't have much – as much lead time associated with them. They're kind of bought as needed. So, we do expect a continued improvement in our orders there and our book-to-bill there during the third quarter, provided more wells are being completed and this increase in frac activity this trend continues.
I think the other downhole products business within our Completions segment, which also had a good book-to-bill ratio in Q2 would be another beneficiary of these as longer laterals. But again, it is a business that's kind of bought on an as needed basis and doesn't have a lead time associated with it. So, it doesn't have as much kind of advanced notice of an upturn as the production equipment does. But you add those three businesses together for us, and that's about 35% of our revenue or so.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
So, probably a little early to call kind of the bottom in Completions, I guess, because you're saying (29:00) just in time is kind of on the quarter. So, you probably cannot make that statement quite yet?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. I just have a question on the M&A. Kind of curious as to when you're going after these smaller companies which has sort of been what you've been going after, what does that competition look like? How many people are showing up for these? I mean, I know a lot of this is tends to be kind of more conversations, are not acquisitions are up for sale necessarily. But I'm just wondering kind of what your competition looks like in some of these and how that's changed over let's say the last, I don't know, six months or so?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, David, if you wait until the business broker or the investment bank sends out the book, you're going to have a lot of competition, right.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Right.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So, the key for us is to try to identify opportunities that are earlier staged than that, we're not wanting to go through that process. And that takes a lot of beating the bushes and going out to meet the entrepreneurs and develop a relationship over time. And many of the – 17 or 18 deals that we – completed acquisitions that we've done over the past several years have had a very long gestation period.
So, we've got a pipeline of those that we're working on. And that's how we try to differentiate our story than others. Now, that's not to say that even if we've developed a relationship, that the seller is not going to want to do a market check. They probably will. And there will be some competition and it often involves private equity, but we know how to handle that. And we've been relatively successful with it. We're not going to win every deal. You certainly – it's kind of like baseball, you're not going to bat more than .500, right, and far from it. But I think our batting average is decent here.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I know we talked yesterday about going after smaller acquisitions and kind of building up the business that way. Is that a concern at all? Do they kind of play in a different pond than you? Does that alter your views at all in the M&A market?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
What's small to NOV is big for us still. When they talk about a deal of $400 million being small, that would be big for us. So, we haven't done many deals of that size. So, yeah, they are looking what they call smaller deals, but those would still qualify as big deals for us. It's not to say that there's not the potential overlap there at the margin, but – and we have crossed paths with them from time to time, but the small end of their range is the big end of our range I would say.

J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you, Cris.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, David.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Samantha Hoh - Evercore ISI
Hey. This is actually Samantha Hoh filling in for James. So most of my questions have been addressed, but I did wanted to hear more about this new mud pump upgrade package that Prady introduced. Just kind of curious. Is this a strategy that you guys are – have used before to sort of go after the various trends in the longer laterals and what not, and just adjusting some pieces of equipment not the whole new capital equipment, but just a part that is essential that needs to be upgraded. And then, can you qualify just sort of how the whole upgrade work? What sort of pieces are you selling in and then also what the aftermarket opportunity is going forward?
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Well, I think that's a great question, Samantha. As you mentioned, I think the trend in the market is longer lateral walls and higher pressure as a result; one of the things the drilling operators do need to position themselves for the upturn is to have higher power mud pump upgrades. And we have already seen several of those orders come through, and our pipeline is pretty strong. As the activity picks up, we expect all the drilling operators, most of them, will upgrade their drill rigs with the mud pump upgrades. Now we are already competitive on the mud pump upgrade. We expect our reliability and the durability and the operating cost to be much better. As a result, we are gaining a lot of traction in the marketplace.
So, for your question now, Samantha, yes. As we see the market trends, we are developing a product portfolio to be aligned with those trends. And another good example is if we look on the Completions side, we have a pretty strong portfolio of products which we're going to introduce and we have already introduced in the first half, and we're going to further introduce in the second half. The other example I talked about, the missile trailer, frac missile trailer is another good example where we're reducing the operating cost for our customers significantly, again, following the same trend in the space.
Now, to answer your question on what's the market potential and where do we go from here, as we talked about, we are expecting about 20 new products to be commercialized in 2016. We have commercialized a few already. Our pipeline is pretty strong. There's a pretty good portfolio of products we're going to introduce on the Completions segment, pretty much compared to (35:12) frac plugs, more on the pressure pumping side, the valves and seats. We've reduced the operating cost significantly for our customers. They're looking for efficiency plays, which reduced not only the operating cost, but improves the life of the product which improves the durability and reliability. In most of the product portfolio, we are aligned and we are developing is in that direction.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I will just...
Samantha Hoh - Evercore ISI
Okay.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Add on the pump upgrade that with these long laterals to drive the mud motors, you need more hydraulic horsepower. And there's still a substantial amount of the Tier 1 rigs that need that 7,500 psi upgrade, which involves a change out of the fluid end side of the drilling rigs, mud pumps and all the associated hardware on the fluid end side. And it costs several hundred thousand dollars per rig typically to do that upgrade.
And there is a significant aftermarket component to that, that once we would do the capital side, we would also be in the prime position to do the ongoing work with maintaining the mud components up on the rig associated with that higher pressure and higher working and have more intensive work that is still prevalent in many areas of the service and drilling side these days.

Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
And the probably the first phase of our opportunity will be North America which is where the upgrades will happen. But all the international market, most of the international market will also follow North America down the road which will also give us further opportunities.
Samantha Hoh - Evercore ISI
That's really great. And I was just wondering during when you – I mean, well, I know we're still a far from being at the point where customers are probably worrying about getting the aftermarket piece reliably, but is there any sort of contracts associated with that? Sort of like a service agreement afterwards? And then is that something that's going to be booked into orders or is it just so short cycled that it's just out the door the minute you get these orders?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
If you're the primary provider of the mud pump consumables for a drilling contractor, they're going to want to maintain some consistency in the consumables for the mud pumps for that rig and across their rigs. So, that – it's more of that type of relationship than it is a contract.
Samantha Hoh - Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. Thank you so much.

Hey, Marc.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Maybe just – hey. Maybe just following up on that last line of questioning and the discussion there. What do you see is the market opportunity for upgrading rigs at higher capacity mud pumps or how do we think about the addressable market there for you guys and maybe how many are you tracking in the near term as business opportunities?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, as I say, there are still quite a few, whether it's 50% of the Tier 1 rigs or not, I – that might be a rough guess as to the number of Tier 1 rigs that are out there, not just working rigs but Tier 1 rigs working and not working that are not upgraded to the 7,500 psi. So, there are still quite a few to do. And we would have good relationships with a number of the leading drilling contractors. I don't want to go into who those are and who those aren't. But they're still – that is clearly a competitive need out there to do these long laterals.
Some of the other areas for upgrades that we're particularly exposed to, the handling tools and of course the catwalks. And everything's about walking rigs now and mobility, and that is an upgrade that we're doing also with our catwalks. Another product that we're introducing is one of the, I guess, the largest catwalks out there and we're working with a rig builder to deliver that for some new rigs as well. So, the catwalks is a continued strength for us both onshore and offshore. Both onshore on Tier 1 drilling rigs but even down to our Little Tripper for the workover and well service market.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks. Maybe just switching over to the commentary about incremental margins of something in the 50% range in the recovery. I think previously we talked about something in the mid-30%s there. I'm just kind of curious, is that all cost cut that's driving that? And any other kind of comments you can have about sort of how you're getting that 50% is pretty impressive.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, the primary drivers, as Jim was saying, is the absorption of a – the better absorption of our manufacturing costs. So, clearly, our manufacturing plans are not busy today. We are carrying a large amount of unabsorbed costs. And we, in other words, can produce significantly more products at the same costs we have today. And that leads to obviously a very high contributor to our overall margins. And that would be the one big factor.

And then thinking about that, what our incremental margins are, it's driven by volumes, Marc, and we're not really including the pricing recovery there, so. That is a different assumption and when that comes, that is obviously – that would be a big adder to incremental margins, when and if that comes.
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Marc, I'd like to just make sure we're clear that these higher incremental margins that we're talking are asset-turn. So the early quarters, as activity improves and we see this absorption improve, we'll seen incremental margins in that higher up to 50% kind of range. But the range you are commenting on in the concept called high-20%s, low-30%s is more of a steady state. Once we've gone through that inflection point, we'll settle down to incrementals more in the range.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
And Marc, probably the other thing I'll add is, as the efficiency gains, which is we're not buying much from a material standpoint, even though our savings are by the end of the year will be 15% to 18%. And there's still further a lot of opportunity in the procurement front. And as we have mentioned, the lean savings will be very significant in 2016 too. So the efficiency gains, as the activity picks up, will be magnified, apart from the absorption issues which Cris was talking about.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That procurement benefit will be significant.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. I guess just maybe one more on that. Is there a way to think about how much revenue could increase before you go back to those high 20%s to 30% type range?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we have significantly underutilized our manufacturing plan as you can imagine. So, I think we have some good running room here to get to fully utilization and until we can fully absorb all of our manufacturing and overhead that we have. I think we've got a good running room, Marc. It's not a near-term issue there.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Marc.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jake Lundberg from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Jacob Lundberg - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hey, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi. Hi, Jake.
Jacob Lundberg - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Just kind of following up on the same line of questions. So, I think you said in the past that in terms of man-hours, you were currently operating at something like 20%-25% of capacity. So I mean, should we think that maybe revenues could quadruple from here before you would run out of that, the operating leverage driving those higher amount of margins?
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
I would say most of the operations are running on a reduced work schedule, not at the 25% as you mentioned. But from a people standpoint, Jacob, they're running at anywhere from 30 to 32 hours depending on where the plant is. So, I think the first phase, as the market turns, is to get back to the full schedule first, which gives another 20%, 25% of – from a people standpoint and then the overtime before we start adding any people.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
From a people standpoint.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. But I think Jake's point is once we get to full schedule overtime, and then staff up to fully utilize our facility, yeah, we've got a lot of increase in potential there. So, before we have to think about certainly adding roofline, but that's when you're running your plant most efficiently is when you're running your first shift at 60 hours, 50, 60 hours a week and you've got a second shift, then you can say that you're at an efficient production rate and gosh, yeah, we're a long way from there.

Jacob Lundberg - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then so, kind of thinking about the second half if, I think rig count is up today something like 7% versus second quarter average or so. If we were up a little more than that overall for the third quarter and then say that we sort of stay there up slightly again in the fourth quarter, I mean, do you think you could hit EBITDA breakeven in all of the businesses by the end of the year under that scenario?
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The businesses that recover early which Cris has described as the production equipment product line and the completions. And those businesses have been at least the completions more book and ship businesses. As we see those improve, we're going to see the most improvement in EBITDA from those product lines in the early days and I'd say by the end of the year, we could be in a good place. Drilling maybe a little bit more delayed because even though rigs are going back to work, there's still the destocking that's taking place and it usually takes a couple of quarters before that starts converting to orders and revenue but the other early cycle product lines should come back more quickly.
Jacob Lundberg - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Great. And if I could sneak one more in. Are you guys able to share what you think your current market share is of mud pumps in the U.S. and maybe where you think you could bring that level to in the next cycle?
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We think we're probably number two or three in that space.
Jacob Lundberg - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Great.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Martin Malloy from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Marty.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
I've got a question on the ROV segment and with the Technip and FMC pending merger. I just wanted to maybe get your comments about how that might change the dynamics for – in the ROV market. Maybe some of Technip's competitors might not want to buy ROVs from them as much as they previously might be inclined to?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's a good question and we don't know the answer to it. But you're pointing to the fact that one of our primary competitors in this consolidated space of building and selling ROVs is FMC with their Schilling brand. And of course, our Perry brand, years and years ago, was owned by Technip. And who knows whether they want to – what their feeling is about that business on a combined basis going forward.
But you're raising a separate issue which is we sell our ROVs to the offshore contractors, Technip and others. And if the Schilling brand of FTI is owned by a competitor. How does that change the feelings for some of the other customers out there about buying from a competitor? It's a good question. Don't know the answer to it, but time will tell. In other spaces, that is often – in other sectors of the industry that is often an issue as to we'd rather buy from an independent supplier rather than from a competitor. And that is why Forum does kind of draw a pretty bright line that we are an independent provider of manufactured products and equipment. We don't compete with our customers, and they can take some confidence in that.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. And then my second question, if – I was wondering if you could maybe talk about differences in the inquiries or orders that you're seeing between the international and the U.S. market. The international market, how that compares to what you're seeing in the domestic market?

Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
The international market has also slowed off, Marty, same as North America, depending on what the product lines are. In the case of – for example, the capital equipment. I would say we are seeing more from the international standpoint that – in the North America. But on the consumables front, I think we are seeing the same pressure from the international market as we are seeing in North America.
Now, the Middle East obviously is very buoyant with all the activity and the amount of investments they're going to make in the region, and that's one of the reasons why we're focusing on the Middle East to improve our presence and also improve our market share.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And when you're talking about capital equipment, I think you're primarily referring probably to the drilling capital equipment, and we are seeing some good opportunities there in the Middle East, for instance.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line Robin Shoemaker from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is open.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Cris, I wanted to ask on your – going back to your incremental margin prediction. How much if anything is required in terms of a pricing recovery to meet those margins? I totally understand that it's all about utilization of your fixed costs. But have you conceded pricing in any of your product lines and does pricing recovery factor into those incrementals?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Robin, we have definitely like everyone in this downturn conceded pricing. No question about that. Our assumption is that it will not be easy to recover the pricing. So, that is not the basis of our feeling about the high incremental margins in the early stage of a recovery. What drives that is volume, better utilization of our facilities and importantly as Prady pointed out, the efficiencies that we're gaining for example on the procurement side and the progress that Prady and Darin Harvey and our procurement team has done a great job as we, for the first time at Forum have really brought kind of 21st century procurement methodology to bear on Forum supply chain.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Right. Okay.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Robin, over a period of time, what we're expecting is over the next two years, even if it fall back 40% of the pricing, the rest of it will be offset with the cost initiatives and the efficiency, and we can get back the margins to about 18% plus.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, understood. Just a specific question on what's happening with regard to sales of fluid ends to your pressure pumping customers and some of them are talking about reactivating some fleets in response to higher demand. So are you selling new kind of your 1,000 horsepower quintuplex pumps? Is it mainly an after-market business right now? Just wondering if you can give us an update on J-Mac and how you perceived the upturn that you're describing in inquiries affecting them.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The number of power ends we're starting at this point, Robin, is low. We're selling some but not many because you really have to talk about a pressure pumping company wanting to bring a stacked fleet out of cold stack and put it back to work before you'd be talking about really selling many power ends. The fluid ends or complete pumps – the fluid ends that we're selling today are primarily the replacement fluid ends when one becomes unusable out in the field.

Now, as stacked equipment goes back to work, when that does happen and it's not happening yet, then the number of fluid ends that would be required would be substantially higher. And of course, as we move to higher utilization even for the fleet that's out there working today. All of the pressure pumping companies are saying, gosh, we first like to get to full utilization of equipments in the field. Well that would be great from our standpoint because that means more hours on the pump per week, per month which means more demand for these consumable products of treating iron and fluid adds.
So there would be demand – both for the – driven by how many hours. The existing equipment is working, but then a step change when you're talking about redeploying and reequipping a stack spread.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good. Well, thanks a lot, Cris.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Very good, Robin.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Sean.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I just want to touch a little bit on the valves; you highlighted some strength in that business during the quarter particularly in the midstream transmission side. CapEx budget is pretty tough there this year particularly in the early part. Just curious, if you can give us a sense of, is that just some seasonal strength. Could you see some good project work or just kind of typical stocking? A little more detail on what was driving that opportunity.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
The midstream part of the segment at least from our standpoint has been pretty stable. Sean, in fact, we have a secured few orders in the first half of 2016 and we expect at least based on our reports in one of the products we are commercializing, in fact we just in the second quarter we commercialized a slab gate valve, which is a new product for us, which is a distributed valve in the midstream space and we have secured some customers already.
So, we do expect the midstream space primarily stable for us, primarily because we're gaining market share in that space. In the case of downstream even though its stable, we are seeing a lot of pressure or market softness on the refinery side, even the petrochemical part of the segment is pretty resilient.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Pretty resilient. Yep.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And I guess on midstream, I guess, could you – is there any more detail about the types of customers, I mean the transmission folks versus selling gas utility or anything – any more detail of how that's underlying or even on the transmission projects you find that's very stable?
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Actually both on the transmission side and on the gas utility side we have secured orders in the first half of 2016. So even though there could be market softness there, we are gaining market share in both areas.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. There's the ongoing work of utilities of having to kind of rebuild their system as it's quite old and unsafe. And then of course there are these transmission lines trying to debottleneck this system out there and then those feeder lines going into these new, all these new petrochemical plants that are being built.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And then just maybe circle back on the Middle East, as you think about that opportunity set, can you give us a sense of how the capital commitments deploy over time, maybe CapEx or working capital? How much you may need to deploy to take advantage of that opportunity?

Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. We are not CapEx – most of the CapEx investments we make are in – are pretty small numbers. So the capital investment we're going to make in Saudi Arabia will be a small number. If I have to give you a range, probably I would say less than $10 million, also significantly less than $10 million for sure.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's probably in the...
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Probably the $5 million range.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
May be even less.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Lease of facility probably...
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Correct.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And move some equipment. So, it will be pretty insignificant, actually.
Prady Iyyanki - President & Chief Operating Officer
Correct. But the key there is the supply chain development for us to take the benefit of the localization part of Saudi Arabia and what they're looking at is not to localize the whole product but the parts of the localization of product which is assembly test and maybe painting, which qualifies us from a localization standpoint to take the benefit of the localization initiative in the Kingdom.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of John Daniel from Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for fitting me in. First question is, just relates to the inventory write-down. Can you – was the (01:00:18) inventory work in process and just some color on the types of inventory that were impacted would be helpful?
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, John, it includes the full span of inventory. So, the way our policy works, we look at inventory as it moves. And traditionally, we've always looked at the way the policy's been applied, just look at historical movement. The way we've applied it this year both mid-year and at the end of the last year, has been to look forward because of the severe downturn and the change in the outlook going forward, we've applied that policy looking forward. But it has – it does cut across all ranges of the inventory.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Okay. Given that the write-down is driven more by, if you will, the mechanical application of that policy, I'm assuming you can still use or sell some of those products in the future. And if that's the case – I mean I'm assuming that would lead to higher potential artificial margin improvement, if you will, on future sales? Is that right?
James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So we only took 100% reserves on inventory that we had plans to scrap, and there is some of that in the reserve that we've added. And the rest, we've limited it to what we felt brought the inventory down to a lower cost of market type of value. So we will be watching as these inventories come out, how that reserve reverses. I wouldn't expect it to come back too quickly. But it is fair to say that we've got inventory now, what we consider to be a fair-carrying value and should be reflective of market margins on a go-forward basis.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Okay. All right. Another one here for you is let's assume you have a customer that enters your restructuring process or it looks like it's apparent they will be entering that process, to the extent you have a receivable then. At what point would you take a reserve against that?

James W. Harris - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Very good question. So we have had heightened procedures this year for monitoring the credit that we extend to customers and have tightened that credit as we've seen customers reaching positions of potentially having to go into a restructuring. So our policy does work on an aging basis, but we will judgmentally – add the reserves if we think there's risk, I would say given the tightness of our processes this year, we've had very good fortune thus far to not have to take significant charges for bad debt reserves despite some of our customers being in difficult positions, and that's been a matter of keeping receivables current and a lot of effort to make sure that the collections are taking place on a timely basis.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Okay.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And John, also some these restructurings particularly for the public companies have been restructurings, debt or equity swaps, but we have been able to continue business and continue to get paid.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Okay. And that's – that's the reason we're going down this path, because there's been some speculation by the better capitalized service companies that vendors will be less likely to work with those that are distressed given their potential risk, if you will, of the receivables risk, so since you're a vendor to these guys, you're a good person to ask and it seems like this is not – you're not going to abandon your relationships with these distressed companies and in fact they might. Is that a fair statement? You're still going to work with them and then certainly once they come out of a restructuring process.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah. That wouldn't be a good assumption on their part.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
Okay, just want to confirm that. And then the last one, I don't know if you would be willing to answer this one, but I'll ask anyways is what's the revenue opportunity for you for each 7,500 psi system upgrade.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, several hundred thousand dollars per rig.
John Daniel - Simmons & Company International
All right. Okay. Thanks, guys. Thanks for your time.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, thank you very much for good questions and your attention and your interest in Forum. And we'll talk to you next quarter.

C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mark. Good morning. I will start with some highlights of our third quarter performance. But I then would like to talk about our strategy going forward. Afterwards, I will turn it over to Prady, who will discuss our business improvement and operational excellence initiatives, and then Jim will provide more detail on our financial results.
The unexpected 20% sequential decline in oil prices and lower U.S. land rig count in the third quarter continued to put downward pressure on drilling and completion activity. We have delivered much of our backlog that we had going into the downturn.
Most of our businesses are an early cycle play on oilfield activity. So, given the severe decline in rig count and completions activity, Forum's third quarter revenue of $245 million decreased 14% sequentially. We earned $0.07 per share and EBITDA for the third quarter was $31 million or 12.8% of revenue.

Forum generated free cash flow after capital expenditures of $54 million during the third quarter; and, once again, our decremental margins were less than our gross margins, demonstrating the benefits of our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives.
With oil prices returning to levels below $50, we have seen a much greater reluctance by our customers to spend money. Although total inbound orders during the third quarter were $213 million, a 7% increase from the level in the second quarter, we expect a slowing trend as we near year-end. The third quarter book-to-bill ratio was 87% for the company as a whole, 76% for the Drilling & Subsea segment, and 101% for the Production & Infrastructure segment.
Within our Drilling & Subsea segment, our Subsea product line performed well, delivering on the backlog from the record orders we received last year. Third quarter revenue and orders increased over the second quarter, including an order we received for two newbuild ROVs during the quarter.
Moving to our Production & Infrastructure segment, inbound orders increased by 22% compared to the second quarter as higher orders for our downstream-related products in production equipment and valves were partially offset by lower orders for our upstream products.
During the quarter, we were pleased to announce that we were awarded a contract to engineer, design and build eight Edge II desalters for Egypt. Our valve product line continues to perform well in this market, as revenue and orders improved in the third quarter due to strong demand in the downstream process sector.
As we look to the fourth quarter, the U.S. rig count continues to drop each week. E&P budgets have been exhausted, customer spending momentum is slowing, and we expect more year-end delivery deferrals by our customers. As a result, we could see our fourth quarter revenues drop to as low as $200 million, which would be below our earnings breakeven point of about $220 million in revenue. Clearly, the bottom of the rig count has been pushed out in time and will be at a lower level, but we think that will occur over the next few quarters.
For us at Forum, we expect orders will improve soon after the rig count bottoms and the destocking runs its course. It has been Forum's strategy to be an early cycle, activity-driven and scalable company with a strong balance sheet and low capital intensity. We have also said we will not sacrifice our ability to benefit in the upturn. Therefore, we are shifting gears. So, far during this down cycle, we have been scaling down operations and cutting costs in line with activity and protecting operating margins in the short-term.
Going forward, we will focus on ensuring that we are prepared to benefit from the recovery. We intend to be a leading-edge beneficiary of the upturn and gain from our early cycle exposure. Our emphasis will shift to competitiveness in the upturn while maintaining our strong financial position and generating cash for future flexibility.
We will retain our core capabilities, expand our product portfolio through new product development, broaden our customer base and improve customer responsiveness. We will also streamline our operations and expect to deliver $100 million improvement in our cost structure, which will increase our margins in a recovery scenario by 500 basis points.
With that, let me ask Prady to update you on several of these initiatives. Prady?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Cris. Good morning, everyone. Let me talk more about streamlining our operations to provide operational efficiencies and update you on our initiatives regarding new product development and expanding our customer base.
In terms of operational efficiencies, we are streamlining into fewer manufacturing facilities and the widespread use of lean techniques will provide more efficient processes and better cycle times. For example, as a result of our lean initiatives in production equipment, we are able to consolidate our Gainesville production equipment location into other facilities.

We are well on our way to a 20% reduction of our global manufacturing footprint without sacrificing capacity and with greater efficiency. We will have manufacturing centers of excellence of products and processes like machine fabrication and assembly in fewer facilities.
We're also exploring opportunities in the areas of distributions, logistics and field service and we expect to gain operational efficiencies. We also see potential benefits of further integrating our product lines and we will share more details on our fourth quarter call.
Our procurement efforts are yielding high single-digit percentage savings across our operations and reducing cycle times of our suppliers. We expect all these initiatives will result in at least $100 million of permanent cost savings, as Cris mentioned in his earliest script.
We have commercialized several new products this year, and we continue to gain momentum in our product development efforts. Our example – one example is our new enhanced Edge II desalter technology which was instrumental for Forum winning the recently announced contract to provide eight units for Egypt.
This technology is used for treating feedstock at higher throughput rates and downstream refinery applications. This is one of the few products that will provide us the opportunity to capitalize on the reinvestment in the refining industry. We'll also look to grow our product portfolio through acquisitions. We have expanded our customer base by adding more than 30 new customers this year.
In addition, we have leveraged existing relationships with strategic customers to pull through other product offerings in the Forum portfolio. We expect to continue to broaden our customer base through our operational initiatives, new products and customer focus.
Our team has responded decisively during this downturn by scaling down operations, reducing costs and maintaining margins. I'm confident that focusing on our efficiency initiatives, expanding our product offerings, growing our customer base and leveraging our balance sheet to pursue acquisitions, will improve Forum's ability to successfully compete in a consolidated market during the recovery.
Jim Harris, our CFO will now discuss the financial results. Jim?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Prady and good morning. I will summarize our quarterly results comparing the third quarter 2015 sequentially with the second quarter 2015. Consolidated revenue of $245 million for the third quarter was down 14% sequentially, as the severe drop in oil prices from mid-2014 has continued to have a significant impact on spending by our customers across our product lines.
Our Drilling & Subsea segment revenue of $139 million was down 18% on softer demand for drilling capital equipment and activity-based consumable products as a drilling activity, especially in the U.S., continued to decline throughout the quarter.
Our Subsea business had a modest increase in revenue as we continued to deliver ROVs ordered in 2014. And as we successfully delivered on recent significant project orders for our Moffat Subsea pipeline inspection systems and ROV hot stabs.
Our Production & Infrastructure segment generated revenue of $106 million, declining 8% on reduced completions activity in the U.S. land market, which drove lower sales of our surface production equipment and pressure pumping consumable products, partially offset by increased valve sales to the midstream and processing industries.
Net income for the third quarter was $7 million, including $2.8 million in translation gains on the stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and euro and $2.2 million of restructuring charges, associated with actions we took in the quarter to further reduce our cost structure in the face of declining market activity.

In addition to our direct cost initiatives, preserving our gross margins, we are on track to reduce our SG&A by over $90 million on an annualized basis from our 2014 second half run rate, to right size the organization through the downturn, even while continuing to make select investments in product development and systems integration.
Operating income, excluding the non-operational items, was $15 million, down $10 million, or 40% from the second quarter with decremental margins of 25% on the reduced revenue. Drilling & Subsea operating income of $9 million was down 52% sequentially on the lower drilling and downhole product revenues.
Production & Infrastructure operating income of $11 million was down 23% sequentially, primarily from the decreased shipments of our pressure pumping consumable products and lower demand for surface production processing equipment.
Adjusted EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 12.8%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior quarter. We came in at the bottom of our EBITDA margin guidance range of low-to-mid teens as oil prices dipped precipitously in August driving further activity decline through the quarter. We have taken the necessary actions to adjust our cost base in line with our outlook for revenue, which has continued to come down with the declining activity levels.
With many customers expecting to shut down non-essential operations through the entire holiday season, on these extremely low plant volumes, we are fighting against pervasive labor and overhead absorption issues. Due to these additional headwinds in the fourth quarter, we are now expecting EBITDA margins around 10% for the quarter.
As we continue to implement facility consolidations, we expect to incur restructuring charges of about $12 million over the next two quarters, three-fourths of which will be non-cash charges. These expenses will yield recurring annual P&L benefits going forward of over $5 million. We will also continue to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles related to prior acquisitions and the inventories in light of the expected longer duration of these lower activity levels.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.07, achieved on the lower-than-expected revenue, with additional cost containment measures throughout the company, and the lower effective tax rates.
Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 91.7 million shares. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $327 million, down $53 million from the second quarter as free cash flow after capital expenditures was $54 million in the quarter. We expect good free cash flow again in the fourth quarter; and in 2016, as we achieve further reductions in inventory. We paid off the balance on our $600 million revolver during the quarter, leaving only our unsecured bonds outstanding, which mature in six years.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter on a net-debt basis was 1.5 times, trailing 12-months EBITDA. A top priority for us remains acquisitions although with the uncertainty around the duration of this downturn, we expect closing transactions will be challenging. We also have $50 million remaining on the authorization for share repurchases.
Interest expense was $7.4 million in the third quarter. Corporate expenses were $5 million. We expect corporate expenses to be around $6 million in the fourth quarter, now down 40% from 2014 levels after implementing our cost reductions.
Capital expenditures were $8 million in the quarter and $28 million year-to-date. We've held our budget for full-year 2015 capital expenditures at approximately $35 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $16.6 million for the quarter and should be approximately $65 million for the full-year.

We lowered our estimated annual effective tax rate to 23% from the prior estimate of 25% as we've continued to see a greater decline in U.S. profits relative to our international operations, in line with a steeper decline in U.S. activity levels.
As a result, a higher proportion of our earnings are subject to the lower statutory tax rates and jurisdictions outside the U.S. The 12% effective tax rate reported for the third quarter is attributable to catch up of the two percentage point drop in the rate applied to year-to-date earnings. For more information about our financial results, please review the earnings release on our website.
I will now turn the call back over to Cris for concluding remarks and to moderate Q&A.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Jim. The primary driver of Forum's results is drilling and completion activity. The downturn in this activity has been reflected in our revenue directly and in real time. I believe our team has done an excellent job of managing costs down in line with falling activity and has limited the negative impact of declining revenue on our margins.
As we look ahead to 2016, we believe, the decline in drilling and completion activity will be bottoming out, and then stabilizing, which will lead to an upturn in our orders. We are turning our focus to preparing for a recovery in our business, and we believe, we will be well positioned for this recovery due to more strong balance sheet and liquidity, our free cash flow generation, and the progress we have made in improving our operational efficiency.
Given our weighting to short cycle consumable products, we believe Forum will be among the first to see financial results benefit from an increase in drilling and completion activity.
Thanks for your interest. And at this point, we will open the line for questions. Nicole, let's take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Blake Hutchinson of Howard Weil. Your line is now open.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
Good morning, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Blake.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
First question, just to kind of understand where we are baseline-wise with the drilling technology sub-segment, given your commentary on the Subsea sub-segment, would it be correct to assume that drilling technologies on a sequential basis was off something on the top line, perhaps greater than 30%? And was that representative primarily of the capital equipment running off? Or would you suggest that that's just kind of what the market is bearing right now?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, Blake. So, no, we weren't down 30%, it was down significantly in the quarter, but not to that level. And, we did deliver on a lot of the capital equipment in the first half of the year. So, we have had fewer deliveries there, and we are subject more to the lower activity levels. So, as we saw the rig count coming down, of course, that had an impact on the consumable products that we sold in the quarter, and that's reflected in drilling results.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And then first the well construction downhole products were down as well during the quarter, with just fewer consumable products being sold as our customers really are trying to preserve their cash, and not spend when they don't have to, particularly on items that needs to be expensed.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
And maybe just sticking with this, so we can kind of tuck this away for the recovery scenario, over the initial part of the quarter, were there portions of the order flow in your short-cycle businesses that were showing particular promise or responsiveness to what were higher price decks at the time?

C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think the main point is this, Blake, that with the additional decline in oil prices since the end of the second quarter that was driven by concern about demand for oil, that 20%, 25% additional decline in oil prices did change the mindset of operators, service companies, and drilling contractors across the board. And it changed that mindset to really protecting balance sheet and cash through the downturn and not wanting to spend money where they didn't have to.
So, I think that that trend gathered force as the oil price fell and we saw that reflected in the declining rig activity that is still going on as rigs roll off their contracts, and we're going to see that through year-end.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
Okay. And then just, if I could sneak one more in there for Jim, you called out the fact that the restructuring – or excuse me, just adjusting the cost base and the absorption of labor and overhead, especially as we see declines in the fourth quarter, are going to be tough to deal with from a margin perspective. Would you call out certain businesses that we were really hitting that kind of biting, can't-cut-any-more decremental as we saw them in 3Q?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, I'd say, I guess the one that I would call out as not having this impact is valves. With the activity levels staying up, those margins have been very resilient. But probably the most pervasive would be in the drilling and the downhole side, as activity levels really are reaching that level where we've taken out a significant amount of the variable cost and in order to achieve greater savings, we are going to have to turn more towards these consolidations to take out that base layer of cost.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
And also the pressure of pumping part of the business, which has the same dynamics. In fact more acute than some of the other product lines will have also the same issues.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
Thanks. That's very helpful. I'll turn it back. Thanks guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And our point, Blake is that there are some things we can do on the cost side, but we are not going to do things that hurt our capacity capability going forward.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
And on the flip side, Blake, also if we look at the pressure pumping, the downhole and the consumable products on the drilling side, those product lines will be the first beneficiary when the market stabilizes, and we will see the orders in our portfolio.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right. Thanks.
Blake Allen Hutchinson - Scotia Howard Weil
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Sean.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the valves and, just really more broadly, on the midstream and downstream. It'd be great to hear a little bit more about how those end markets are holding up for your product lines. And it sounds like downstream has been a nice partial offset for upstream. And do you think you are seeing it – do you have any better visibility for those end markets, obviously relative to what's a pretty foggy upstream outlook?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
The downstream part of the portfolio, Sean, and the markets are pretty stable, and we expect that stability on a move-forward basis too. The upstream part of the portfolio has seen lot of softness and we expect to see that softness on a move-forward basis too.

Now the refinery part of the market has reached a saturation and at some point they need to upgrade the refineries in Canada, North America, also across the globe. We just don't know when that uptick is going to happen, but we are seeing some signs very spotty at this point of time.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We're seeing more downstream investment in the Middle East and that's evidenced by this one contract we have but there are others there as well, as producers in those regions want to be able to sell more products not just crude.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. Yeah. It seems like we've been waiting for that downstream pick-up forever, but hopefully at some point it will come through. The other thing I wanted to touch on was SG&A. You mentioned the $90 million reduction. At some point when we do get into a recovery, how do we think about growth of SG&A? How much of that would you characterize as structural or efficiency gains as you're improving through the down cycle? And how much is cyclical that you think would need to come back to support the business?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Clearly, a large part of our SG&A reductions are cyclical and would come back in a recovery scenario. But we will have in a recovery scenario other costs that will generate better savings. For instance, on the procurement side, obviously, we're not buying so much in goods coming in at this point in the cycle.
So, although we're negotiating good percentage savings on our purchasing side, the dollar savings aren't so much now, but they would be greater then. So, that's why we're saying at least $100 million in cost savings in a strong recovery scenario. And then as we add back SG&A costs as the company grows, we'll be able to offset that cost increase with more savings on the operational side, right, Prady?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, of course.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then just one last quick one in a similar vein. Just thinking about working capital, how do you think about the drawdown possibilities in the year-end? And if we stay at current activity levels, what are the additional opportunities through 2016 in terms of what we'd expect from a cash basis?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, two comments. First, we do have a fair amount of non-cash charges in our earnings. So, even as earnings approach breakeven, we have the opportunity to generate good free cash flow even in that scenario without pulling down working capital.
We feel like our biggest opportunity going into 2016 is in the inventory area, our turns have come down from around 2.7 times to this last quarter of about 1.4 times on the much lower activity. We did see in the quarter, our first reduction of about $15 million of inventory, which was a good move, it's hard to get that engine going from growing to shrinking, but we have turned that corner, and we'd expect to see that accelerate into 2016.
And it's fair to say at these activity levels, we believe that over the next – I'm going to call it two-year period, because it takes a while to move the inventory at slower, when activity is slower, there's probably $200 million of opportunity to take inventory or working capital off of our books over the next two years.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And I would just add Sean that we've been averaging so far this year, $30 million per quarter in free cash flow after capital spending. And we think that we can maintain that average rate of free cash flow per quarter – clearly through 2015 and through 2016.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC

The free cash flow generation has definitely been impressive. Yeah. Thank you for all the detail. I appreciate it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George O'Leary of TPH & Co. Your line is now open.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Morning, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Morning.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Just wanted to drill down a little bit into the Drilling & Subsea segment a little bit further, if I could. And then, I had a pressure pumping question in there. So, I guess, if you compare and contrast the drilling with downhole, the two reporting units that were down sequentially, which was down more materially on the quarter? I'm not looking for quantitative guidance, but just qualitatively, which was...
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
They were down pretty close and both being tied to drilling and completion activity.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
And was flow equipment essentially in line with those in terms of the magnitude quarter-on-quarter?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Flow equipment – the pressure pumping, obviously what's going on in the pressure pumping market out there for the service companies, and as we all know, really struggling on the pricing standpoint. I think those companies are doing whatever they can, not to spend money and particularly on maintenance items that need to be expensed. So, that business is a struggle for our customers, and as a result, they're not wanting to spend any money they don't have to. So, we're seeing demand down there more sharply.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
All right. That's short-term, right. At some point, you need to start maintaining that equipment, if it's going to continue to work.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. That's helpful color. And then, you guys have done a great job on the free cash flow generation, and it looks like there's still a good bit more for you guys to do from an inventory standpoint. I guess, how much running room do you see is left there to blow down inventories as we move forward?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
A lot.
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, we have about $500 million in inventory and by our best assessments, we could bring that down to around $300 million. So, it's a lot of room.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
And then maybe one more, just kind of a qualitative question. And there are a lot of customers in some of your end markets that we would consider sort of distressed or at EBITDA breakeven levels. How are just customer conversations going now versus three months ago? And how are customers behaving today?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, as I said that there has been a real paradigm shift in customer attitudes, and it's across the board, and the emphasis is on preserving cash and balance sheets. The biggest customers are wanting to protect their dividend. And then they want to protect their credit rating, or as we move down, they want to stay within their debt covenants, or they express it in terms of staying within their cash flow, or not outspending their resources. They all express it depending on their particular position differently, but the result is the same, a great reluctance to spend money at these oil price levels. And so, that's accelerating the destocking, it's deferring maintenance and consumable items, deferring whatever one can. But that as we say, that can't go on for a long. And once we get to a sustainable level of activity then the spending would need to increase also to a sustainable level.

George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the color guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie of IBERIA Capital Partners. Your line is now open.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Thank you. I guess Jim, question is probably for you, but anyone else feel free to jump in. From a standpoint of M&A, with you guys kind of hovering at or below breakeven levels of revenue, does that change how you think about potentially buying companies in order to consolidate facilities and put more volume through your existing plants?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Acquisitions are a key part of our strategy, we have a strong financial position. So, we continue to view ourselves as acquirers and consolidators. And I think we have a stronger financial position than many other companies of our size.
So, we think we're entering a phase in the cycle where more opportunities for acquisition are developing; but our experience has been that in order to actually reach agreements on valuation and get things done, that has more often happened as the recovery begins to kick-in. And as folks have better visibility on the end of a downturn.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks. In terms of your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, would we expect to see kind of the distribution of where the fall comes from to be similar to what we saw from 2Q to 3Q?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the important thing about Q4 is, a lot of it is driven by this paradigm of not wanting to spend money, budgets being exhausted. Let's wait until next year, things slowing down. In a way, it's going to be a two-month quarter. We're going to get to mid Thanksgiving – mid-November and there's going to be a lot more discussion we think with our customers and their customers about the two Hs; hunting and holidays.
And I think that is going to cause and be associated with not much going on from a business standpoint, and a lot more discussion of the two Hs and low activity, as we go into the year, and just waiting for next year, coupled with not wanting to take delivery of a lot and put it on your balance sheet at year-end, and just help your working capital as everybody is trying to show the best cash flow they can, right.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Right. But I guess, so my question is more along the lines of which – are the same product lines we saw weakness in likely to stay being weak? And, for example, would valves remain fairly defensive on a go-forward basis?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
We expect the valves business to be still stable in the fourth quarter. The product lines which are exposed on the completion side, which is the pressure pumping, the downhole part of the portfolio will see a decline. And also the drilling consumables side, the customers are trying to preserve cash, I think we expect to see some decline. Also our backlog is also depleting over the year, and we will see some backlog depleting too in the fourth quarter.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Is most of the backlog still in Subsea?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Subsea and Drilling.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, Cris. I guess, first, kind of a little bit bigger-picture question. Obviously, we've been hearing about the Thanksgiving slowdown happen from a lot of people here, so I don't think that's a huge surprise. But in your experience, on the other side of this, somebody earlier today said they were expecting a huge first-quarter pick-up – hearing about so-called budgets being reloaded and people going right back to work. Others are talking about a delay.

As budgets kind of do come out, people kind of look at balance sheets, you kind of hinted about that a little bit a few minutes ago. How are you kind of thinking about how 2016 could progress? So, let's just take oil prices out of this. But right now, the way budgets kind of get set, when do you think people actually do start getting back in activity? Would that be kind of later first quarter, from what you can tell for right now?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. David, I think it's going to be a slow start to the year. I think we end the year with low momentum and that carries over to the first quarter. But, it's going to be low, people are going to kind of be waiting to see what happens with oil prices. So, start-out slow and we're hopeful that we kind of reach the bottom here, things level outs and then gather momentum as the year goes on.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And then if we think about your drilling technologies business and sort of the consumables in there, obviously we're going to have a lot less rigs being active probably structurally going forward. How does your business kind of reposition itself going forward?
I guess I would just assume there's going to be – obviously will be a lot more Tier 1 rigs. Can you talk about maybe the opportunity in the consumables side on that Tier 1 side? I think a lot of people are just kind of wondering how this – with the mix shifting of the rigs in the market, how does that kind of impact your business as we think about kind of a recovery here?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
For our products, Tier 1 rigs use the same kind of handling tools, pump consumables, pump packages as other types of rigs, maybe higher pressures. But the key point is these newer more capable Tier 1 rigs drove faster, right. So, they're handling more pipe, they're pumping more fluids. So, it's all about how many feet are drilled, and as we're drilling longer laterals, as we're doing more pad side drilling unless moving the rigs more uptime on the pumps and more turning to the right. So, that intensity is probably a good thing for us and it provides some offset to the fact that there would be fewer rigs working.
But the important thing for us is the trend, the rate of change. So, when the rate of change is rapidly down as it is now, there is not a need for consumables, because they can be used off rigs that are being stacked. But once that flattens out, and then particularly when it inflects and begins to go up and you need to resupply a rig that's been stripped, that's very good for our business.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And I guess one last question on the consumables side. Maybe this is a little bit more on kind of flow equipment I'm wondering about. Weatherford was talking about artificial lift sort of hitting that, getting close to that inflection point on customer inventory levels and their own inventory levels. This has been a bit of a subject we've talked about over the years with you guys.
Can you help us understand a little bit of kind of – I guess, this is more of a flow equipment question, where kind of the customer inventory is versus your inventory and the rest of the market, and where we are in that cycle?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, we as manufacturers, we and others probably have plenty of inventory that's not an issue. But, as we've been saying, I think, the customers are doing whatever they can to avoid or defer purchasing and so they are definitely working down their inventories.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Still more, okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.

C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Marty.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning. Just along the lines of shifting focus to prepare for an upturn, can you maybe talk to us about any new products that you are introducing that you'd like to highlight that we should pay attention to?
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, Marty. I think the products which will see the first benefit of the market stabilization would be in the area of pressure pumping, downhole and the drilling consumable products. And they also commercialized several new products this year. For example, in the case of downhole, we're just launching our third-body centralizer, and also a Shorty frac plug, which reduces the operational cost for our customers.
In the case of pressure pumping, our objective is to reduce the maintenance cost of our customers. And we're going to launch a couple of new products in that space in the next few quarters. And as you know, during the OTC, we commercialized our 3,000 horsepower pump, which we're going to take the benefit of that during the upscale.
Also the power-ends of J-MAC – the J-MAC acquisition, which we did early part of the year, is gaining momentum on the power-ends. Even during the downturn, we have sold several power-ends, which improves the life of the power-end which is available in the marketplace.
So, our play during the up cycle is not only to take the benefit of the market stabilization but also commercializing these products, which improves the efficiency and the operating cost for our customers.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. On the drilling side, our complete pump packages now for the replacement fluid and to the liners and our P-Quip system for making a liner replacement more efficient, and selling that as a complete system now. I think we're doing a better job of supplying packages for our customers and they're beginning to realize that as well. And across each of these businesses, there are new products and packages that we're introducing, and I think that will go over well.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
And just this year alone, Marty, we've commercialized about 20 new products across all product lines. And most of them are focused on improving the operational efficiency and the operating cost for the customers.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. And if I could ask a question on the Subsea side, I think in the past you've said for 2014 that aftermarket or non-new ROV orders or revenues were about $160 million, about 50%. Can you talk about maybe how we should think about the trends there in a downturn, when you don't have a lot of new ROVs being ordered for the aftermarket side?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we have some but not a lot of new ROVs being ordered. And so, a greater part of our Subsea revenue will be more the operating expense spend by our customers, whether that is on tooling, or positioning equipment, or on spares and refurbishment for our ROVs.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Relative to $160 million run rate during 2014, would you expect that to still trend down some? Or do you potentially...
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think that will trend down some, because utilization of ROVs is declining but it's not declining as fast as the ROV capital side. So, the ROV part of our business is our probably latest cycle of our businesses and tends to follow by a year the downturn in other parts.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Probably the only thing I'll add to that, Marty, is, as you know our Subsea business has the CapEx and the OpEx part, the OpEx part of the business seemed to have stabilized over for the last several months. But also one of the product lines in Subsea, which we expect to be stable going into 2016 is the Moffat. The Moffat product line had a record year in 2015, and we expect them to be stable going into 2016, too.

Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good morning, guys.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Jim.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Cris, you talk about strategy, and you made a point of you're shifting your strategy – and you made it sound serious and important and comprehensive. And I'm just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. I know you're going to lean manufacturing and you're consolidating and closing facilities, and putting things together, and the integration and efficiency. But it sounded like more than that. And you made a point of it being a change and shift in strategy going forward.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, let me be clear, Jim, that Forum's strategy is that we are a capital-light, high cash flow generating, consumable-oriented company with strong brands serving the Drilling/Subsea completions markets. The emphasis change in our strategy is a change from managing for the downturn to instead managing for a recovery.
And I think that how one manages for those two things is a bit different. So, streamlining our costs but with an emphasis on how we're going to get ongoing benefits from those cuts, while preserving and hopefully enhancing our capabilities from a technical product development standpoint and ability to respond to our customers' shorter cycle process, right? So, that's, I think, the main point, Jim, is a shift from managing for a downturn to managing and positioning for an upturn.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Also, if I could, you talk about how M&A is one of the core competencies of your business, and it has been in the past. And you also noticed that it's awful hard to get deals closed in the current market. When do you think M&A really will start to occur?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think that the active period for M&A will be as recovery – the early stages of a recovery. And the reason for that is the seller doesn't feel like they are at the – selling at the bottom.
As a buyer, we have visibility that, of how long the downturn is going to last and can bake in some more positive aspects into our valuation. And at that point, valuations are more likely to come into line. And also from the seller's standpoint, having made it through Death Valley there, an opportunity to sell without having to go through that again is attractive.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Gentlemen, thanks very much. Appreciate it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Yes. Thanks. So, Cris, going back to your statement about how you've delivered most of your backlog that you had going into the downturn, and now you're, I guess, going forward delivering more recently booked backlog. So, wanted to ask the question about what you've seen during this downturn in terms of pricing weakness or pricing discounts. I think of your products as not having meaningful pricing deterioration in the downturn, but I wanted to see if you would comment on it?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's right, far less than the service companies or certainly nothing like drilling contractors. And that's just true of the manufacturing business, in general. Prady, you can comment on what we're seeing from a pricing standpoint.

Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
I think, if you look across the product lines, depending on what the product line is, the impact of pricing we are seeing is in single-digits to double-digits in some product lines. If I had to give you the extremes of it, I would say, valves where we have not seen any impact on pricing or even if we have seen it's been a minimal impact on pricing.
And then on the extreme end, probably the pressure pumping and the downhole products, again the products where we will see them which are forced are the ones where we are seeing the impact of pricing. However, we've been able to offset part of the pricing pressure with some of the initiatives we have on the operational front, which is the procurement savings. And our procurement savings are in high single-digits across the operations.
And some of the things we've done on the operational side, of consolidation of plans and using lean and some of the other initiatives that we've been talking about, all that's helping to offset the pricing pressure and that's one of the reasons why we've been able to hold our margins still in double-digits.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Right. And then just to put a pin in it, probably the average price reduction across the company is upper single-digits.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Correct.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Good. So, then, in terms of this recovery that we're kind of preparing for – basically, with all that you're doing now, if we assume that you went back to something like the $400 million to $500 million revenue per quarter run rate, where you were in 2014, are you saying that 500 basis points that you're getting now, is that what we would expect in a revenue run rate versus those kind of high-teens margins?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Robin, that is what we're saying that in a recovery scenario where revenue does recover that we feel with this streamline cost structure that we're now working towards, we will be able to save in that scenario 500 basis points.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
With no impact of – positive impact of any pricing claw-back. So, as the market turns and when we start pulling back the pricing that's on the top.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. All right. That answered my question. Thank you.
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's what we're managing for. Thanks for the question, Robin.
Robin E. Shoemaker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, good morning. Wanted to come back to your comments around the change in focus and how you're managing the company here going forward. So, certainly seems like a shift from playing defense a little bit to maybe a more offensive kind of approach. You've gone through some of what that entails. Kind of interested in why and what's the – you know, what gives you the confidence that now is the time to do that? I would actually tend to agree with you. You kind of want to zig when others are zagging. But it seems like everyone else is still zagging, and playing defense, and kind of settling in for a potentially protracted downturn here. So, again just wondering kind of, why you're taking a bit of a different course?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, I think one important point is, we have the advantage of a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow and don't have to worry about the existential questions, right. So, that gives us the luxury of looking ahead and planning for what we should be doing rather than what we have to be doing. That's an important element of it.

Secondly, we view ourselves right at the forefront, right at the leading edge of our business being tied to what's happening in activity levels or even the trend in activity levels in real time. So, unlike say some of our big capital equipment brethren, who have very long lead times for their equipment and long cycle backlogs, we work in a very real-time shorter response on this basis. So, we will be able to through our products, see the benefits much more quickly.
But we need to position the company to realize those benefits and to have a better cost structure going forward. We've given up price through this downturn as an industry, as a service, and equipment industry, unlike any other that I can recall, we can't count on getting that back anytime soon.
So, having a better cost structure is an important element for competitiveness. Forum for better words has the position of, as a young company, of having many levers that we can pull of the things that Prady has been talking about, of implementing better procurement lean systems that we really haven't had before and have a real impact for us, but we've got to get those things in place now, if they're going to give us that leverage as the market turns.
And we don't know exactly when that is, but we do know it's getting closer, and we expect as we said that the bottom to the inflection point is in 2016.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
From an operational standpoint, if we can have three things accomplished going into the stabilization mode and the uptick is better cost position. And all the operational initiatives we have will position us to go, have that stronger cost position that what we had in 2014. Broader customer portfolio and broader product portfolio.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And if it is turns out that you're wrong in that view, and we are settling in for an extended downturn here, perhaps lasting well into, if not all of, the next year, do you have to shift gears again? Is there an incremental level of retrenchment? Or do you feel like with what you've already done plus the initiatives you announced today, that you've got a sustainable cost structure anyway. And you're still okay – again, given some of the things you highlighted, you have a good balance sheet, and you are pretty comfortably free cash flow positive?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We're definitely free cash flow positive and we have a strong balance sheet. And I think as we said just getting to a point of stability, even if it's at a low activity level, that would be better than this constant deceleration that we've been in here for a long time.
So, at some point, it does need to bottom out, and we think that we're getting closer to that. I would be very surprised if we continue to see the rig count declined the way it is for another year. I think it might be at zero by that point.
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
That's the good news. It can only go to zero. That's all for me, thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So, let's see, just one last question. Most everything else has been answered. And you hit on this on the working capital. I think – did I hear the number that your inventories – you thought you could get them down by $200 million? Was that right?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. Chase, over a two-year period. With activity as low as it is, I don't want to imply that, that's easy. Obviously, customers have to demand it, but we do believe that we have that much in terms of inventory that we can bring down and at these activity levels where we should be. So, it is the $200 million opportunity.

B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
And so, I guess, if we kind of look at that over the next couple of quarters, how should we be thinking about inventories and total cash from working capital?
James W. Harris - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. I think that probably the best way to think in terms of cash flow Chase is, as Cris said earlier that $30 million run rate on free cash flow after CapEx, there may be some quarters that would be a little better and some a little less, but it will average around that $30 million number.
B. Chase Mulvehill - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Brandon B. Dobell - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just, two quick ones, did you guys think about the performance in North America versus international markets? How do you expect that to look as you work through Q4/Q1? And is there a concern that there's going to be a longer duration on how long it takes the international market to find a bottom or some stability?
C. Christopher Gaut - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, we're closer on the North America market, particularly U.S. market here. And I think that will reach bottom first. International, there are a lot more forces in play, including national oil companies that have bigger countrywide issues to deal with, particularly in areas outside the Middle East, big economic issues that could impact their spending plans for longer. So yeah, I think, there is that difference.
Prady Iyyanki - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
In the costs of international, they're still stable. And the Middle East is still pretty stable, West Africa and North Africa are still seem to be stable. The deal we have – the Egypt deal, which we received in the third quarter is another good sign, so they're spotty markets in international, which are still pretty stable.
