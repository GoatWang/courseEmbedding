Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

LLC, VOIP Transfers (NC), LLC, VOIP Transfers (TN), LLC, VOIP Transfers (VA), LLC and Wisconsin Procurement Holdco LLC (each, an LLC) provide that a member, a manager, a director, any officer, their respective affiliates or any person
who at any time serves or has served as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any member or any such affiliate, and who, in such capacity, engages or has engaged in activities on behalf of the applicable LLC, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by such LLC to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any losses, damages, expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnifiable person is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was engaged in activities on behalf of such LLC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
indemnification is available under the limited liability company agreement of any of the LLCs in respect of any such claim adjudged to be primarily the result of bad faith, willful misconduct or fraud of an indemnifiable person. Any act or omission
by an indemnifiable person done in reliance upon the opinion of independent legal counsel or public accountants selected with reasonable care shall not constitute bad faith, willful misconduct, or fraud on the part of such indemnifiable person.
Payment of these indemnification obligations shall be made from the assets of the applicable LLC and the members shall not be personally liable to an indemnifiable person for payment of indemnification. 
  II-4 


The limited liability company agreement of CC VIII, LLC (CC VIII) provides that, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, a member, a manager, a director, or an officer, their respective affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification from CC VIII for any loss, damage, or claim incurred by such person by reason of any act or
omission performed or omitted by such person in good faith on behalf of, or in connection with the business and affairs of, CC VIII and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such person; provided that any
such indemnity shall be provided out of and to the extent of CC VIIIs assets only.  The limited liability company agreement of
TWC/Charter Green Bay Cable Advertising, LLC (Green Bay) provides that Green Bay shall indemnify the members and their respective affiliates, shareholders, partners, members, employees, officers and directors, for, and hold them harmless
from, any liability, whether civil or criminal, and any loss, damage, or expense, including reasonable attorneys fees, to the extent that such arise from and are the result of the ordinary and proper conduct of Green Bays business and
the preservation of its business and property, or arise by reason of the fact that such person is or was a member or an officer, director or employee thereof; provided the member or person to be indemnified acted in good faith. The obligation of
Green Bay to indemnify the members or any other person shall be satisfied out of Green Bays assets only.  Corporations 
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the persons conduct was unlawful. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law does not permit
indemnification in any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless and only
to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses, which such court shall deem proper. To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to
above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter, such person shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys fees, actually and reasonably incurred by such person. Indemnity is mandatory to the extent a claim, issue or matter has
been successfully defended. The Delaware General Corporation Law also allows a corporation to provide for the elimination or limit of the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director   


 
(i)
for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders,   


 
(ii)
for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,   


 
(iii)
for unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions, or   


 
(iv)
for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. These provisions will not limit the liability of directors or officers under the federal securities laws of the United States.
 The bylaws of CCO Capital require it, to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, to
indemnify any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of CCO

  II-5 



Capital or is or was serving at the request of CCO Capital as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
entity or enterprise, in each case, against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection therewith.  Limited Partnerships 
Section 17-108 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that a limited partnership may, and shall have the power
to, indemnify and hold harmless any partner or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever, subject to such standards and restrictions set forth in the partnership agreement. 
The limited partnership agreements of Falcon Community Cable, L.P., Falcon Video Communications, L.P., Helicon Partners I, L.P., Peachtree
Cable TV, L.P., The Helicon Group, L.P., Insight Communications Company, L.P., Insight Communications of Kentucky, L.P., Insight Kentucky Partners I, L.P., Insight Kentucky Partners II, L.P. and Insight Midwest, L.P. (each, a
Partnership) provide that a partner, any of such partners affiliates or any person who at any time serves or has served as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any partner or any such affiliate, and who, in such
capacity, engages or has engaged in activities on behalf of the applicable Partnership, shall be indemnified and held harmless by such Partnership against any losses, damages, expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnifiable person is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was
engaged in activities on behalf of such Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification is available under the limited partnership agreement of any of the Partnerships in respect of any such claim adjudged to be primarily the result
of bad faith, willful misconduct or fraud of an indemnifiable person. Any act or omission by an indemnifiable person done in reliance upon the opinion of independent legal counsel or public accountants selected with reasonable care shall not
constitute bad faith, willful misconduct, or fraud on the part of such indemnifiable person. Payment of these indemnification obligations shall be made from the assets of the applicable Partnership and the partners shall not be personally liable to
an indemnifiable person for payment of indemnification.  Colorado 
Section 7-80-104(1)(k) of the Colorado Limited Liability Company Act permits a company to indemnify a member or manager or former member
or manager of the limited liability company as provided in Section 7-80-407. Under Section 7-80-407, a limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager for payments made, and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities
incurred by the member or manager, in the ordinary conduct of the business of the limited liability company or for the preservation of its business or property if such payments were made or liabilities incurred without violation of the members
or managers duties to the limited liability company.  The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Bresnan Broadband of Colorado, LLC
provides for the indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Colorado law.  Montana 
Section 38-8-504 of the Montana Limited Liability Company Act states that a limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager
for payments made and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities incurred by the member or manager in the ordinary course of the business of the company or for the preservation of its business or property. 
The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Bresnan Broadband of Montana, LLC provides for the indemnification of officers and directors to the
fullest extent permitted by Montana law. 
  II-6 


Utah 
Section 48-2c-1802 of the Utah Revised Limited Liability Company Act permits a company to indemnify an individual made a party to a
proceeding because he is or was a manager against liability incurred in the proceeding if: (a) his conduct was in good faith; (b) he reasonably believed that his conduct was in, or not opposed to, the companys best interests; and
(c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, he had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A managers conduct with respect to any employee benefit plan for a purpose he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the
interests of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of Subsection (1)(b).  The
Limited Liability Company Agreement of Bresnan Broadband of Utah, LLC provides for the indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Utah law. 
Wyoming  Section 17-29-408 of
the Wyoming Limited Liability Company Act permits a Wyoming limited liability company to indemnify any member of a member-manager company or any manager of a manager-managed company for any debt, obligation or other liability incurred by such member
or manager in the course of the members or managers activities on behalf of the Wyoming limited liability company, if in making the payment or incurring the debt, obligation or other liability, the member or manager was acting within the
scope of his or her duties.  The Limited Liability Company Agreement of Bresnan Broadband of Wyoming, LLC provides for the indemnification
of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Wyoming law.  California 
The limited partnership agreements of Falcon Cable Media, a California Limited Partnership, Falcon Cable Systems Company II, L.P., Falcon
Cablevision, a California Limited Partnership, Falcon Community Ventures I Limited Partnership and Falcon Telecable, a California Limited Partnership (each, a California Partnership) provide that a partner, any of such partners
affiliates or any person who at any time serves or has served as a director, officer, employee or other agent of any partner or any such affiliate, and who, in such capacity, engages or has engaged in activities on behalf of the applicable
California Partnership, shall be indemnified and held harmless by such California Partnership against any losses, damages, expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such indemnifiable person is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was engaged in activities on behalf of such California
Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no indemnification is available under the limited partnership agreement of any of the California Partnerships in respect of any such claim adjudged to be primarily the result of bad faith, willful
misconduct or fraud of an indemnifiable person. Any act or omission by an indemnifiable person done in reliance upon the opinion of independent legal counsel or public accountants selected with reasonable care shall not constitute bad faith, willful
misconduct, or fraud on the part of such indemnifiable person. Payment of these indemnification obligations shall be made from the assets of the applicable California Partnership and the partners shall not be personally liable to an indemnifiable
person for payment of indemnification.  Section 15904.06 (Operative January 1, 2008) of the 2008 California Revised Limited
Partnership Act addresses the rights of a general partner with respect to its management and conduct of partnership activities. The 2008 California Revised Limited Partnership Act provides that a limited partnership shall reimburse a general partner
for payments made, and indemnify a general partner for liabilities incurred by, the general partner in the ordinary course of the activities of the partnership or for the preservation of its activities or property.

Item 21. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. 
Exhibits  Reference is made to the Exhibit Index
filed as part of this Registration Statement.  Financial Statement Schedules 
Schedules not listed above are omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required or because the information required by such
omitted schedules is set forth in the financial statements or the notes thereto.  Item 22. Undertakings. 
(a) The undersigned registrants hereby undertake: 
(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement: 
(i) to include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act; 
(ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities
offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration
statement; and  (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the
registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.  (2) That, for the purpose of determining
any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof.  (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being
registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.  (4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the
Securities Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule
430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to
such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use. 
(5) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
the securities, in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant 
  II-8 



pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of
any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: 
(i) any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrants relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule
424;  (ii) any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants or used or
referred to by the undersigned registrants;  (iii) the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing
material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrants; and  (iv)
any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.  (b) That, for purposes of determining any
liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report
pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  (c) The undersigned registrants hereby undertake to respond to
requests for information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to Item 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of this form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or
other equally prompt means. This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request. 
(d) The undersigned registrants hereby undertake to supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company
being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became effective.  Insofar as
indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been advised that in the
opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by the registrants
of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrants in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered, the registrants will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by them is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
  II-9

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
