In November 2010, Ms. Cornell retired as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Gardner Denver, Inc., a leading global manufacturer of compressors, blowers, pumps, loading arms, and fuel systems for various industrial, medical, environmental, transportation, and process applications.

She is currently President and CEO (since December 2015) of the privately-owned Owensboro Grain Company (grain and soybean products), where she also serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee. She is also a director of the privately-owned Dot Foods, Inc. (a food distributor), where she is a member of the Compensation Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee. Until December 2016, Ms. Cornell served on the Board of Directors of Alamo Group, Inc. (agriculture and other equipment), where she was Chairperson of the Audit Committee and a member of the Compensation Committee. Ms. Cornell is a Certified Public Accountant.

 

The Company's Board of Directors concluded that Ms. Cornell should serve as a director based on her long tenure in operations and finance, including as Chief Financial Officer of a major public company and most recently as President and Chief Executive Officer of Owensboro Grain Company, and her experience as a member of the board of both a public and private company.

Helen Cornell Appointed to Hillenbrand Board

Aug 16, 2011, 10:30 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Hillenbrand, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BATESVILLE, Ind., Aug. 16, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of Hillenbrand, Inc. (NYSE:   HI), has appointed Helen W. Cornell to a newly created board seat, effective immediately. 
"Helen is a wonderful addition to our board," said Ray J. Hillenbrand, chairman of the Hillenbrand board of directors. "We look forward to benefitting from her deep talent and experience in finance, operations and growth through acquisitions. Helen's background also provides her with strong insight into our process equipment business platform, which will be invaluable as we continue to transform Hillenbrand into a global diversified industrial company."
In November 2010, Cornell retired as executive vice president and chief financial officer of Gardner Denver, Inc., a leading global manufacturer of compressors, blowers, pumps, loading arms and fuel systems for various industrial, medical, environmental, transportation and process applications. She served in various operating and financial roles of increasing responsibility at Gardner Denver during her 22-year tenure at the company, including a term as vice president and general manager of the Fluid Transfer Division and as vice president of strategic planning. 
Active in the business community, Cornell chairs the Audit Committee for two boards: The Alamo Group, where she is also a member of the Compensation Committee, and the privately owned Owensboro Grain Company, where she is also a member of the Executive Committee. In Quincy, Ill., where she resides, Cornell has experience on the boards of several not-for-profit organizations.
"Hillenbrand has a strong, sustainable growth strategy, supported by a culture that values quality, service and prudent cash management," said Cornell. "The company is poised for growth on a global scale, and I'm excited to be part of this effort to build additional value for shareholders."
A certified public accountant (CPA) and certified management accountant (CMA), Cornell has a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Kentucky and a master's in business administration from Vanderbilt University.
