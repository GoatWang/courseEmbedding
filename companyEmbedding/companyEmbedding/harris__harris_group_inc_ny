(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "will," "may," "continue," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "would," "could," "should," "targets," "projects," and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:   our future operating results;   our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies;   the impact of investments that we expect to make;   our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;   the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest;   the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives;   our expected financings and investments;   the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; and   the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations and/or monetization of our positions in our portfolio companies.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation:   an economic downturn could impair our portfolio companies' ability to continue to operate, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies;   a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access the equity markets could impair our investment activities;   interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly if we elect to use leverage as a material part of our investment strategy;   currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; and   the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.  Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. Important assumptions include our ability to originate new investments, certain margins and levels of profitability and the availability of additional capital. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or  forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Background and Overview  We incorporated under the laws of the state of New York in August 1981. In 1983, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO"). In 1984, we divested all of our assets except Otisville BioTech, Inc., and became a financial services company with the investment in Otisville as the initial focus of our business activity.  In 1992, we registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, commencing operations as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. In 1995, we elected to become a business development company ("BDC") subject to the provisions of Sections 55 through 65 of the 1940 Act.  We have historically identified and invested in transformative companies enabled by what we believed was disruptive science. More recently, we have focused on investing in transformative companies in precision health and medicine. We then provided strategic, operational and management resources, and creative financial solutions to these companies. While we will continue to provide such resources to our existing portfolio companies, including our precision health and medicine companies, our future new investments will be focused on what we believe are significantly undervalued, small publicly traded companies where we believe we can positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism.  We believe we combine new perspectives with the historical knowledge and experience of managing the current portfolio. We believe these complementary sets of experiences and skills in investment management and in working with management teams to build businesses can be a foundation for future growth. We believe we will be able to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter, more predictable timeframes than those we have experienced over the past several years.  While there are multiple fund managers that invest in smaller publicly traded companies, we believe that these managers are often not able or interested to actively engage with such companies. We believe our expertise and focus on constructive activism could be an attractive complement to other investors in the space. Our new simplified structure and focus could lead to partnerships or other opportunities. We believe that the universe of potential partners on this strategy is substantially larger than those focused on privately held investments. We believe we will be in a strong position to seek these strategic partnership opportunities with the current and future assets of our company.  We believe we provide four core benefits to our shareholders. First, our go-forward investment strategy offers investors the opportunity to leverage our experience, extensive diligence and active portfolio management in what we believe are significantly undervalued publicly traded companies that may be difficult to replicate on an individual basis. Second, we provide shareholders with access to an existing privately held portfolio of disruptive companies that we believe may yield significant returns on invested capital in the future. Third, we provide access for accredited investors to co-invest with us in our portfolio companies when we acquire pre-emptive rights and either lack sufficient capital to fully exercise those rights, or otherwise determine that such investment is not appropriate for us. Fourth, we are able to invest opportunistically in multiple types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies.  Proposals to Withdraw Election to be Treated as a BDC and Change of Corporate Name  We recently filed a definitive proxy statement proposing that the Company obtain shareholder approval to withdraw its election to be treated as a BDC and to change its name from Harris & Harris Group, Inc., to 180 Degree Capital Corp. ("180"). Concurrent with the withdrawal of the election, we would immediately register as a closed-end investment company (hereinafter, a "Registered Closed-End Fund"). As a Registered Closed-End Fund, we would remain subject to many of the same provisions of the 1940 Act that we are subject to as a BDC. We are proposing to convert from a BDC to a Registered Closed-End Fund because we believe that certain provisions of corporate law and the 1940 Act will enable us to operate with a lower expense ratio. We believe this change will increase returns to investors, while allowing us to maintain a comparable investment strategy. Such provisions include:   Less frequent and less complex reports filed with the SEC; and   Exemption of Registered Closed-End Funds from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We currently expect that the transition from a BDC to a Registered Closed-End Fund will enable us to reduce our annual operating expenses attributable to regulatory and compliance requirements.  Our priority with the proposed name change is to reflect the focus of our future business and to provide the opportunity to re-brand the firm. Initially, 180 will be focused on shepherding the existing portfolio of investments to maximize returns, with what we believe will be less regulatory burden and expense to shareholders than in a BDC structure. 180's future business will be focused on making decisions that are designed to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter, more predictable timeframes. Toward this goal, and as discussed above, 180 will focus on investing in and providing value-add assistance through constructive activism to what management believes are substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for aggressive growth. Our goal is that the result of our constructive activism leads to a reversal in direction for the share prices of these investee companies, i.e., a 180-degree turn.  Review of 2016  During 2016, we continued to take steps to position the Company for potential future growth. We believe a number of accomplishments, including those of our privately held portfolio companies during the year, have the potential to contribute to this goal. These steps and accomplishments include:   We increased our investment income by 95 percent and decreased our net operating loss by 37 percent during 2016 as compared with 2015.   We decreased our operating expenses for the third consecutive year. Additionally, in 2017 and pending approval from shareholders, we are positioned to significantly reduce our net operating loss primarily through the withdrawal of our election to be treated as a BDC and transition to a Registered Closed-End Fund.   We announced changes in our business that we believe will enable us to generate income and grow net asset value per share for shareholders over shorter, more predictable timeframes than those we have experienced over the past several years. More specifically, our go-forward focus will be on investing in and providing value-add assistance through constructive activism to what management believes are substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for aggressive growth. Our goal is that the result of our constructive activism leads to a reversal in direction for the share prices of these investee companies, thereby creating value for our shareholders.   We paid off all of our outstanding obligations associated with the Loan Facility with ORIX Corporate Capital, Inc. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have outstanding debt.   We executed an agreement whereby Metabolon, Inc., repurchased all our securities of Metabolon for proceeds of $10,802,329, versus our cost basis of $7,231,212.   We sold our shares of Magic Leap, Inc., to two undisclosed buyers for aggregate gross proceeds of $640,928, versus our cost basis of $338,604.   We launched our first two co-investment funds offered by H&H Co-Investment Partners, LLC, an entity formed to provide shareholders who are accredited investors and other accredited investors the opportunity to invest alongside us in our portfolio companies on an individual portfolio company basis. The first two co-investment funds will invest in rounds of financing of D-Wave Systems, Inc., and HZO, Inc.  A number of our portfolio companies announced financings and/or business milestones during the year, including:   D-Wave Systems, Inc., announced details of its most advanced quantum computing system, the D-Wave 2000QTM, at the inaugural users group conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico. During the first quarter of 2017, D-Wave Systems announced the sale of its first D-Wave 2000QTM to Temporal Defense Systems, a cybersecurity firm. D-Wave Systems also announced the formation of D-Wave Government Inc., a U.S. subsidiary formed to provide D-Wave Systems's quantum computer systems to the U.S. government. D-Wave Systems also announced the members of the subsidiary's independent board, which include prominent executives with extensive experience at U.S. government agencies including the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the National Science Board, the Defense Science Board and the Intelligence Community.   AgBiome, LLC, announced the award of a multi-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the evaluation and development of lead, proprietary biological fungicides in the fields of African smallholder farmers. The aim of the project is to identify and validate biological fungicides to control one or more of three major crop diseases of importance in Sub-Saharan Africa: sorghum anthracnose, black Sigatoka in banana, and aflatoxin contamination in maize.   Mersana Therapeutics, Inc., expanded its partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, providing Mersana Therapeutics with an upfront payment of $40 million and an additional payment of $20 million upon clearance of the IND (Investigational New Drug application) for XMT-1522 by the FDA. Subject to the success of the XMT-1522 and antibody-drug conjugate programs, Mersana Therapeutics is eligible to receive milestone payments of more than $750 million combined as well as royalties. Takeda also agreed to invest up to $20 million in Mersana Therapeutics's future equity rounds of financing.   Additionally, Mersana Therapeutics, Inc., raised an equity round of capital from new and current investors at a higher price per share than the company's prior round of financing. Lodo Therapeutics Corporation completed the second tranche of its initial equity round of financing. HZO, Inc., and NGX Bio, Inc., raised capital through issuance of convertible notes to new and existing investors.   The acquisition of Bridgelux, Inc., by a consortium of buyers that was initially announced in July 2015, closed on August 1, 2016.   Several of our portfolio companies announced new partnerships, including ORIG3N, Inc., with the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers; Ensemble Therapeutics Corporation with Novartis; Nanosys, Inc., with Hitachi; and Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc., with Pieris Pharma.   TARA Biosystems, Inc., appointed serial entrepreneur and leading researcher, Professor Robert Langer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to its board of directors.   HZO, Inc., announced a collaboration with Rakuten Kobo to protect its latest eReader, the Kobo Aura ONE.   Interome, Inc. (renamed HALE.life Corporation in 2017) announced that it is a co-organizer of the UnDx Consortium(TM). The UnDx Consortium brings together five precision medicine technology providers and prominent experts from medical centers and universities across the country to collaborate in an effort to produce new hypotheses for a group of seven patients struggling with undiagnosed diseases. The UnDx Consortium met to explore results of cutting-edge tests analyzing samples from these patients and their families. That meeting was the beginning of what is expected to evolve into an ongoing forum to explore the potential of combining precision medicine technologies to diagnose and treat disease. Interome subsequently announced that collaborators and organizers of the UnDx Consortium met again at the 14th annual Future in Review (FiRe) conference in Park City, UT. The meeting included a summary of the UnDx Consortium, a discussion of hypotheses resulting from the analysis of data, and the proposed next steps for the Consortium.   Muses Labs, Inc., presented data from a pilot study of its MEND Protocol for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2016. MEND Protocol is a multi-step cognitive evaluation process that uses advanced data processing technology to initially assess an individual's existing risk factors. Additionally. Muses Labs and Metabolon, Inc., announced a partnership to study and apply metabolomics in individuals with pre- and early-symptomatic cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Muses Labs and Metabolon stated that they expect to bring new clinical trial services and updated care protocols to the market.   EchoPixel, Inc., announced that its medical virtual reality system is ready for clinical implementation. The system is being distributed to customers in collaboration with the HP Zvr Interactive Virtual Reality Display and workstation. Additionally, EchoPixel's 3D visualization technology was profiled in an article and video by ABC News.  We also faced the following challenges during the year:   Our net asset value per share decreased from $2.88 as of December 31, 2015, to $2.34 as of December 31, 2016.   Our share price decreased from $2.20 as of December 31, 2015, to $1.38 as of December 30, 2016, the last trading day of the year, and $1.34 as of March 14, 2017.   Two of our portfolio companies, Cambrios Technologies Corporation and Ultora, Inc., completed auctions of their respective assets by a trustee appointed to conduct such liquidations for the benefit of creditors. We did not receive any proceeds from the liquidation of assets of either company.   Senova Systems, Inc., sold substantially all of its assets to an undisclosed buyer for an upfront payment and potential future milestone payments. Even if all of the milestone payments are received in full, we do not expect to recover our cost basis of approximately $4 million. The Company received proceeds of $356,336 as repayment of the principal and accrued interest of its outstanding bridge notes of Senova Systems.   The values of public equities, particularly those of microcapitalization companies, are highly volatile. The price per share and market capitalization of Adesto Technologies Corporation decreased in value from $7.71 as of December 31, 2015, to $1.85 as of December 30, 2016, the last trading day of the year, and closed at $4.10 as of March 14, 2017. Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc., decreased in value from $0.23 as of December 31, 2015, to $0.13 as of December 30, 2016, the last trading day of the year, and closed at $0.13 as of March 14, 2017.   The change in the price per share of Adesto Technologies Corporation between December 30, 2016, the last trading day of the year, and March 14, 2017, equals an increase of approximately $0.13 in net asset value per share.   The prices per share of Adesto Technologies Corporation's and Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc.'s common stock continue to trade below the price per share at the time of each company's initial public listing. Additionally, the stock prices of comparable public market companies that impact the market's valuation of certain of our portfolio companies also decreased during the year.   The Company sold 1,409,796 shares of OpGen, Inc., a publicly traded portfolio company, in open market transactions for net proceeds, after commission, of $2,382,008, or an average sale price of $1.69 per share. Our average cost basis in OpGen was $4.02 per share. As of December 31, 2016, the Company no longer owned any shares of common stock of OpGen, but continues to hold 332,039 warrants to purchase common stock of OpGen.   The Company sold 243,540 shares of Champions Oncology, Inc., a publicly traded portfolio company, in open market transactions for net proceeds, after commission, of $407,344, or an average sale price of $1.67 per share. Our average cost basis in Champions Oncology was $6.66 per share. As of December 31, 2016, the Company no longer owned any shares of common stock of Champions Oncology, but continues to hold 5,500 warrants to purchase common stock of Champions Oncology.   The Company sold 500,000 warrants to purchase common stock of Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded portfolio company, for net proceeds of $40,000, or an average sale price per warrant of $0.08. Our average cost basis per warrant was $0.36. As of December 31, 2016, the Company continues to hold 7,966,368 shares of common stock and 1,255,120 warrants to purchase common stock of Enumeral Biomedical Holdings.   Even though financings of some of our portfolio companies may have occurred at increases in price per share from prior rounds of financing, such increases in value may not be reflected in full in our values owing to other rights and preferences afforded to investors in those rounds of financing. This challenge, in part, led to a decrease in our net asset value per share during 2016.   IPOs of small companies are difficult to complete, and, when they are completed, they often occur at valuations lower than publicly traded comparable companies and rounds of private financing.   The downturn in the oil and gas sector negatively affected the business operations of at least one of our portfolio companies, Produced Water Absorbents, Inc.  2017 Outlook  We have three core initiatives that we believe will continue to position us to generate returns for stockholders through appreciation in our net asset value, stock buybacks and dividends.  1) We will continue to cultivate our maturing companies that have the potential to generate substantial returns. We will also continue to cultivate our focus on precision health and medicine through Interome, Inc. (renamed HALE.life Corporation in 2017).  2) We will continue to reduce our net operating loss (defined as our investment income less our expenses). Our net operating loss decreased by 43 percent over the period of time from 2014 through 2016. We believe we can materially reduce this loss further in 2017 through a reduction in our expenses enabled primarily by the withdrawal of our election to be treated as a BDC and transition to a Registered Closed-End Fund, subsequent to shareholder approval. We will also continue to seek to increase substantially the short-term income generated from existing and new investments to offset our operating expenses and potentially generate additional cash flows for shareholders of the Company. This reduction in net operating loss will permit our shareholders to realize more of the value of our portfolio as it matures in the coming years.  3) We will execute on a strategy for future new investments that will focus on what we believe are significantly undervalued, small publicly traded companies where we have the potential to positively impact the business and valuation through constructive activism. We will also more actively employ constructive activism in publicly traded positions currently in our portfolio (namely Adesto Technologies Corporation and Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc.) as well as positions that become publicly traded from our existing privately held portfolio of investments.  Reduction of Net Operating Loss  During 2016, we reduced our net operating loss from approximately $7.2 million to $4.5 million. This reduction was owing to the following changes made during 2016:   We reduced the size of our investment team from four managing directors to two managing directors.   Alexei Andreev, one of our former managing directors, transitioned to a part-time employee of the Company. Misti Ushio, another of our former managing directors, resigned on February 29, 2016, to pursue her role as CEO of one of our portfolio companies, TARA Biosystems, Inc. We generated substantial income from fees for providing managerial assistance to portfolio companies, particularly Interome, Inc., which changed its name to HALE.life Corporation in early 2017.  We currently believe we will reduce our net operating loss further in 2017.  Portfolio Summary  As of December 31, 2016, we had 21 privately held, equity-focused companies in our portfolio that have yet to complete liquidity events (e.g., public listings or merger and acquisition ("M&A") transactions) and are not in the process of liquidating their assets (our "Active Portfolio"). These do not include 1) our publicly traded and unrestricted securities of Adesto Technologies Corporation and Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc.; 2) our investment in NanoTerra, Inc., which was originally structured as a non-convertible debt investment; 3) our rights to milestone payments from Amgen, Inc., Laird Technologies, Inc., and Canon, Inc.; 4) our portfolio companies, 180 Degree Capital Corp., Ensemble Therapeutics Corporation, Laser Light Engines, Inc., and ProMuc, Inc., which are in the process of selling, licensing or liquidating their assets and/or have shut down; 5) our portfolio company AgTech Accelerator Corporation from which we have withdrawn participation; and 6) our portfolio companies, Black Silicon Holdings, Inc., Senova Systems, Inc., and SynGlyco, Inc., that exist to collect payments from the sale of subsidiaries or assets. As of December 31, 2016, we valued these 21 privately held equity-focused companies at $49,491,797. Including the companies referenced above, we valued our total portfolio at $58,334,309 as of December 31, 2016.  Summary of Returns  Since our investment in Otisville in 1983 through December 31, 2016, we have made a total of 114 equity-focused investments. We have completely exited 83 and partially exited two of these 114 investments, recognizing aggregate net realized gains of $80,579,506 on invested capital of $160,743,473. For the securities of the 29 privately held companies in our equity-focused portfolio held at December 31, 2016, we have net unrealized depreciation of $32,444,438 on invested capital of $83,720,546. We have aggregate net realized gains on our exited companies, offset by unrealized depreciation for our 29 currently held equity-focused investments of $48,135,068 on invested capital of $244,464,019. The above net realized gains do not take into consideration our annual operating expenses over the period from 1983 to December 31, 2016, which are directly or indirectly borne by our shareholders. At December 31, 2016, from first dollar in, the investment weighted average holding period for the 29 privately held equity-focused investments was 8.3 years. Historically, as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out, the investment weighted average holding period for the 83 investments we have fully exited was 6.5 years.  The amount of net realized losses includes the following exits in 2016:   Realized gains of:   $3,571,117 on our investment in Metabolon, Inc.   $302,324 on our investment in Magic Leap, Inc.   Realized losses of:   $3,418,349 on our investment in Cambrios Technologies Corporation.   $3,283,700 on our investment in OpGen, Inc.   $2,999,470 on our investment in Bridgelux, Inc.   $1,244,955 on our investment in Ultora, Inc.   $1,215,285 on our investment in Champions Oncology, Inc. . . .

Harris & Harris Group is a publicly traded venture capital firm which invests in nanotechnology companies. Harris & Harris Group was incorporated in 1981, and it completed an initial public offering (IPO) in 1983.
Throughout its history, Harris & Harris Group made over 90 investments. Over 60 of these investments have generated realized returns of approximately $160 million on cumulative invested capital of approximately $92 million.[citation needed]
In 2011, five of Harris & Harris Group’s portfolio companies completed liquidity events including two IPOs (Solazyme and NeoPhotonics) and three sale transactions (BioVex Group to Amgen, Innovalight to DuPont and Crystal IS to Asahi Kasei).
In July 2013, portfolio company Xradia was acquired by Carl Zeiss.
Other investments include Nantero,[1] Nanosys, Kovio, and Ensemble Therapeutics.
Restatement[edit]
On March 15, 2005, management concluded that the previously issued consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 should no longer be relied upon was restated because of computational errors in Consolidated Statements of Operations.[2]
