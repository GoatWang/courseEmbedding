MILPITAS, Calif., Sept. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., a company developing novel, orally stable peptide therapeutics for gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, today announced the appointment of Richard S. Shames, M.D. as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Shames, most recently Senior Vice President and CMO at Aldea Pharmaceuticals, joins Protagonist with over 25 years of experience in clinical medicine and the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry.
"Richard Shames has a long track record of success in leadership positions in clinical drug development across multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, which will serve Protagonist well as we initiate clinical trials of our lead oral peptide, PTG-100, for inflammatory bowel diseases," said Dinesh Patel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Protagonist. "His background includes oversight of the clinical development of novel small molecule and biologics programs at both clinical-stage biotechnology companies and global pharmaceutical firms. I am very pleased to welcome Richard to the Protagonist executive team."
"I am excited to join Protagonist Therapeutics as it advances its lead asset PTG-100 toward clinical trials," stated Dr. Shames. "There is a significant opportunity to bring targeted, orally stable therapies to patients who are affected by inflammatory bowel disease. I look forward to advancing our novel treatments into clinical development and potentially into therapeutic use."
Prior to joining Aldea, Dr. Shames was Distinguished Scientist, Clinical Research and Early Biologics Lead (Immunology) at Merck & Co., Inc. There he led the early stage development of novel biologics and biosimilar programs for over four years, including the clinical development of an anti-IL23p19 monoclonal antibody in psoriasis, currently in Phase 3 studies. Prior to joining Merck, Dr. Shames held positions of increasing responsibility at Facet Biotech (formerly PDL Biopharma) over the course of 10 years prior to that company's acquisition by Abbott, including management of Facet's immunology development pipeline, as Therapeutic Area Head of Immunology. Before joining the life sciences industry, Dr. Shames held full time clinical faculty positions in Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Stanford University and the University of California, San Francisco Schools of Medicine. He received his M.D. degree from the University of California, Davis School of Medicine.
About Protagonist Therapeutics
Protagonist Therapeutics is a U.S.-incorporated biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of orally stable peptides as targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. The company has an innovative and proprietary technology platform that enables it to develop potent and orally stable peptides against protein-protein interaction (PPI) targets that are otherwise undruggable by small molecules and therefore have historically been approached largely by injectable antibodies. Oral peptides may lead to a superior and safer choice for IBD patients, physicians, and payers by virtue of their better convenience and compliance, and potentially enhanced safety and efficacy in comparison to other therapeutic options. The company is nearing the completion of IND-enabling studies of an alpha-4-beta-7 integrin-specific oral peptide antagonist PTG-100, and has several other assets including an oral IL-23 receptor antagonist in different stages of research and pre-clinical development.
Protagonist is headquartered in Milpitas, California USA and is a spin-out from the University of Queensland's Institute of Molecular Biosciences (IMB).  The company has its pre-clinical and clinical operations in California, and discovery operations both in California and in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

Recommended Vitamins 




Over the years we have learned how certain vitamin and mineral products can enhance hormone balance. However, the strength and type of vitamin supplements generally available at drug stores is not enough to adequately help these energy-sapping conditions.
The products for sale at health food stores are better than those offered by drugstores, but still are lacking the potency and purity needed for optimal thyroid, adrenal, and sex gland recovery.
For that reason we have worked for years with two specific companies known to the medical profession to be the absolute top of the line. These optimally sourced products use the most hypo-allergic fillers and excipients, as well as maintaining an exceptional degree of quality control.
These companies are:
Xymogen
Below you will find Xymogen products for general hormone balance (multivivitamin/mineral, extra anti-oxidants, essential fatty acids, and extra amino acids). In addition, Xymogen also makes specific vitamin, mineral, and herbal formulas for each specific endo-type. We have indicated our recommendations here. Xymogen has over 25 years of experience, operating as Atlantic ProNutrients or APN, in providing exclusive professional formulas to health care practitioners. As an independent health sciences company, Xymogen has introduced numerous innovations to the Functional Medicine Community.
The Xymogen line of formulas was researched and developed based on the overwhelming demands of their customers, with regard to maintaining the most effective nutraceuticals on the market.
TO ORDER Xymogen Products call: Order Online at: www.canaryclub.org
Or By Telephone at: 707 245-0102   9am – 5 pm EST
Dr. Shames Recommends the following Xymogen formulas:

ActivNutrients   (multi-vitamin)
Adrenal Essence   (ginseng stress formula)
ALAmax CR   (alpha-lipoic)
CoQmax CF   (Co-Q-10)
Corticare-B   (pantothenic, B6)
D3 Liquid 1000   (vitamin D)
5-HTP CR   (five-hydroxy-tryptophan)
IgG Pure   (amino acids)
LipotropiX   (guggulsterone, taurine)
L-Theanine 200
Med Caps T3   (rosemary, ashwaganda, selenium)
Med Caps Menopause
Melatonin
MemorAll   (ginkgo)
Mood Food   (GABA)
Omega Pure EFA   (essential oils omega 3-6-9)
Oraxinol   (anti-oxidant)
Prostate Flo
SedaLin  (sleep herbs)

Feeling Fat, Fuzzy or Frazzled? 




Our Mission: to Help You Get Healthy and Live a Fuller Life Today
Fatigue, depression, weight gain, high cholesterol, low sex function, insomnia, anxiety, attention deficit, and severe menopause are common health challenges today. Yet generally, they are NOT the true culprit.
Evidence is mounting that a spiraling epidemic is catching tens of millions in its escalating whirl. It drains our life force, then dumps us – unceremoniously – into doctors’ offices.
If our lab tests show normal, we may be blamed for not eating right, not thinking right, not getting enough exercise. We are given pills that obscure the real problem, leaving us vainly searching for our former fuller lives.
Didn’t Your Doctor Tell You About Metabolic Gland Imbalance?
What often lies at the he art of these various diagnoses, with hundreds of related symptoms, is one underlying common cause: Metabolic gland imbalance, now in epidemic proportions.
Experts concur that one in ten Americans have some degree of endocrine gland disruption, where the various glands that are supposed to work together in harmony (such as thyroid, adrenals, and sex glands) become depleted or confused, altering their hormonal output, wreaking havoc on our lives.
There is Really No Reason to Suffer with Gland Disruption!
As a committed doctor-nurse team, we know that it can be fixed. And as two people, like you, who have metabolic gland imbalance (as do all three of our children), we know how much better you can feel.
We have written our book “Feeling Fat, Fuzzy or Frazzled?” and created this website, so that you can go from Fat, Fuzzy Or Frazzled to Fit, Focused and Fabulous!
Our commitment is to walk this path with you, to help you take the steps- via our book, website, and coaching- to end gland disruption and reclaim your full vitality so that you can live your fullest life, with passion and purpose. Thank you for allowing us to support your health journey.

Charming, smart, serious, perfectionist... yep, what you want in an eye doctor!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

How do I sign up for hormone coaching to balance my energy glands?
On the Hormone Coaching Sessions page there is a link to a one-page Coaching Agreement and instructions on signing up for a coaching session.
Are the Health Coaching Sessions offered in another language besides English?
No. Though the website can be translated into several languages to make it easier for you to read, the Coaching Sessions themselves are in ENGLISH ONLY.
I notice that Karilee Shames is available to do mind-body health coaching. What is that? and what does it cost?
Karilee’s work is viewed as an extension of the more medically-oriented work of Dr. Rich, wherein she makes herself available via phone for those who wish to discuss emotional / spiritual / energetic challenges from hormone imbalance. As a longstanding low-thyroid person herself, as well as a Certified Holisitic Nurse and Certified Clinical Specialist in Psychiatric Nursing, Karilee has worked with this condition, and its many faces, for almost 30 years. She is gifted in helping people access their emotional blocks, even via telephone, and in supporting assertive communications and healthy decision-making that will enable hormone sufferers to feel better more of the time. Her health care consultations emphasize self-care aspects and empowerment. A 50 minute phone or office session with Karilee Shames is $150.
Can Dr. Shames give me a referral for a good local practitioner?
Dr. Shames may indeed be able to recommend a particular practitioner as part of your health coaching session. After speaking with you about your individual situation and needs, he will be much more likely to know your case well enough to make an appropriate referral from his practitioner database.
***DR. SHAMES CAN ONLY MAKE REFERRALS FOR THOSE HE HAS PERSONALLY COACHED.***
What does a health coaching session to balance my energy glands cost?
The initial session (50 minutes time on the phone with the doctor) costs $270. Some people choose to have subsequent health care consultations after the initial one, in order to better understand their complex situation, and make inroads into successful management quickly. The half-session (25 minutes) re-consult is available at a fee of $170, generally preserved for those who have had at least one full consult, and for their practitioners, who may wish to consult with Dr. Shames as well.
Then who will order my tests, and prescribe my medicine?
Dr. Shames will help you learn how to best present his suggestions to your regular doctor in a way that will ensure the greatest likelihood that the tests or medicine you want will indeed be ordered. If your present physician will not listen to you, or consider you as a therapeutic partner in your own health care, then Dr. Shames will recommend a more appropriate physician for you to see in your own locale when possible. He pulls from a variety of databases from which he will choose several practitioners who practice near you and can help you proceed effectively.
If I sign up for health coaching, does that mean Dr. Shames will be my doctor?
Dr. Shames can only be a personal physician for those people who he actually meets and examines – and sees face-to-face on a regular basis in his medical office. Therefore, a coaching session is something different. Instead of being your doctor, and ordering tests and prescribing medicines, Dr. Shames is your health care consultant—your information source point and answer person. He is someone who really listens to you, and offers his best thinking based on 25 years of clinical experience. He will help you to create a hormone recovery plan.
What if I’m already taking medications for these glands?
If you are already diagnosed and currently taking medication, either prescription or over-the-counter variety, Dr. Shames can suggest to you ways in which your present treatment program might be optimized. Many people do better with a change in brand, dose, or type of thyroid medicine; sometimes two or three medicines need to be combined for best results. How and when to make such changes is a very intricate and personal matter, also taking into account your belief systems, life events and current stressors that may be contributing to your present symptoms.
What generally occurs during a health coaching session?
Dr. Shames will go over your pertinent health history, blood tests, other lab data, including basal temperature and scans, family history, associated conditions, and previous recommendations from other practitioners. This composite of your own individual health information is then summarized by the doctor with an eye toward achieving the most beneficial treatment plan. Dr. Shames will make suggestions for additional testing if needed and tell you where they can be obtained.
What is the difference between a health coaching session and in-person medical office visit to Dr. Shames? 
When you come into the medical office as a patient, you are being treated as a medical patient of the office. However, Dr. Shames has very limited office hours. When you sign up for health coaching with Dr. Shames, you are receiving health education to help you guide your local practitioner better in evaluating and treating your condition; no Dr.-patient relationship exists with the coaching option. The coaching session are valuable in a different way; you receive the full advantage of Dr. Shames vast experience, can fax him your recent lab results, and get his impression of your status and your best options for the future. Keep in mind that even as a medical office patient, you are required to be working with a primary care doctor; Dr. Shames works solely as a health care consultant regarding your possible hormone imbalances. Office fees are significantly higher in person, and must be paid at the time of booking your in-person office appointment, though often you can be reimbursed for partial expenses. You will not receive reimbursement for health coaching. Still, we considering coaching the model for the future, and often people can get coaching must sooner than an office appointment. – We view this option as a way to help you advocate for better health care for yourself and loved ones.
What is hormone coaching to balance energy glands (thyroid, adrenal and sex glands)?
Hormone coaching to re-balance your energy glands (thyroid, adrenal and sex glands) occurs when a person with these concerns books time with Dr. Richard Shames for over the telephone information specific to his/her own personal situation. It is your time – 50 minutes alone with the doctor.
