IBC ManufacturingIBC Advanced Alloys has two manufacturing divisions – Copper Alloys and Engineered Materials.  Our Copper Division manufactures and distributes a wide variety of copper alloys as castings and forgings: beryllium copper, chrome copper and aluminum bronze in plate, block, bar, rings; and specialty copper alloy forgings for plastic mold tooling and resistance welding applications.  IBC Engineered Materials Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of IBC Advanced Alloys Corp, has a family of beryllium aluminum alloys that overcomes the limitations of pure beryllium and existing aluminum alloys, while retaining the benefits of the two metals.
The Copper Division has three main facilities in Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Missouri.  Our Franklin, IN facility was founded in 1946 and comprises our large 1500 ton forge press, three forge hammers, a ring rolling mill, a complete heat treatment center, lathes, milling machines, CNC equipment, and saws.  Casting of a wide variety of copper alloys commenced at the New Madrid, MO location in 1988.  The manufacturing of beryllium containing casting and master alloys began at our Royersford, Pennsylvania production facility in 1994. This location also manufactures beryllium nickel and beryllium aluminum master alloy products.
The capability to produce large high quality production input billets has given IBC Advanced Alloys a strong competitive advantage in beryllium copper wrought products. Large diameter input billets equate to larger and more size flexible rod and plate configurations. It should be noted, forged beryllium copper rod and plate products exhibit improved grain micro-structures with more consistently homogeneous uniformity. IBC Advanced Alloys supplies only superior precision forged beryllium copper rod and plate products.
In 2011, IBC Engineered Materials Corp completed construction of a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Wilmington, MA.  The new plant represents a major investment by IBC and significantly increases the Company’s production capacity for near net shape investment castings using the proprietary Beralcast® family of high performance ultra-lightweight alloys.
Designed specifically to meet our customers’ increasingly technical requirements and high quality standards, while accommodating faster and more demanding delivery schedules, the factory is the launch pad for the explosive growth of Beralcast®.  The plant also includes a second furnace that will ultimately further increase capacity.

C17510 - Beryllium Copper Alloy Description: C17510 - Beryllium Copper mold materials have hardness properties comparable to tool steels, but with superior thermal conductivity. Beryllium copper plate, block, bar and rounds -- upset forged and heat treated to multiple tempers for our Thermal-Mould™ product line's plastic mold tooling applications -- are available in a choice of strength, hardness and thermal conductivity levels.
C17510 Beryllium Copper is manufactured to provide a good strength with even better thermal conductivity than C17200. This copper alloy offers conductivity of 45 to 60 percent of pure copper while providing significant strength and hardness properties. This copper alloy is often used in the resistance welding industry.
Applications of C17510: C17510 Beryllium Copper is typically used in conductors, relay parts, connectors, heavy duty, instrument parts, fuse clips, switch parts, fasteners, thermal transfer plates, high flux electromagnets, welding equipment, die casting plunger tips, and springs.

IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. 
               TSX VENTURE : IB
OTCQB : IAALF

 





July 17, 2017 16:01 ET
IBC Advanced Alloys Issues Progress Report to Shareholders



FRANKLIN, INDIANA--(Marketwired - July 17, 2017) - IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. (TSX VENTURE:IB)(OTCQB:IAALF) ("IBC" or the "Company") a leading beryllium and copper advanced alloys company, announced today that it has issued a Progress Report to its shareholders, available for viewing on the web at https://goo.gl/fqKE8D as well as SEDAR. 
The Progress Report from IBC Board Chairman Mark Smith and President, Director, and CEO Major General Duncan Heinz (USMC, ret.) provides updates on a variety of efforts being made by the Company to meet its goal of achieving profitability for the first time in its modern history. The Company reiterated that its goal is to swing to profitability in 2017. 
Highlights from the progress report include the following:

The Company has now completed the major components of its capital improvements program, launched in 2016, including installation and operational status of advanced production furnaces in both its copper alloys and beryllium alloys divisions.
            Sales are up across both of IBC's operating divisions, as evidenced in the Company's financial disclosure for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In particular, sales to the semiconductor manufacturing sector have experienced strong growth compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The Company also is securing new orders from new customers, such as the contract IBC announced recently with Raytheon for beryllium-aluminum products.
            IBC's work to supply beryllium-aluminum products for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is likely to accelerate, as production of this fighter jet evolves from its current low rate of initial quantities to full-rate production.
            The Company's financial performance has improved markedly over the past year. As outlined in the Company's most recently filed financial results, which cover the quarter ending March 31, 2017, IBC posted strong sequential sales gains, booked the highest revenue in four quarters, and continued to narrow its losses.
            The Company recently completed a C$1.4 million capital raise, driven largely by existing IBC shareholders, which will help provide sufficient day-to-day working capital as a bridge to profitability.

On Behalf of the Board of Directors: 
Duncan Heinz, President, CEO and Director

 IBC Advanced Alloys Receives $1.3M Order From Asian Precision Mfg. Multinational 
 Mon, 04/20/2015 - 9:18am 
 Comments 
 by IBC Advanced Alloys  

 



IBC Advanced Alloys Corp., an advanced alloys and precision castings company, reports that its Copper Alloys division has received a $1.3 million order from a new multinational manufacturing customer based in Asia. Delivery of the finished products is expected to begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and IBC is confident of additional business.
IBC is expanding its business development initiatives to meet the growing global demand for specialty high performance copper alloy products. Asian markets are increasingly important and IBC will continue to leverage its expertise in these dynamic economies. IBC's new customer has contracted for specialized engineered copper alloy products to improve their production line efficiency, operating margins and yields. The customer identity has not been disclosed for competitive reasons.
IBC Copper Alloys' President Mark Wolma summarized, "IBC's business development initiatives focus on improving margins and expanding our product line with semi-finished products. We have identified a wide range of value-add opportunities for specific industries and are in active discussions with several groups. While Copper Alloys has accounts generating similar annual revenues, this $1.3 million single order is an important validation of our expanded business strategy. This order also supports", continued Wolma, "Copper Alloys' focus on value-added, higher-margin growth opportunities where we have a sustainable competitive advantage."
Anthony Dutton, CEO of IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. said, "IBC is building a strong reputation as a materials solutions provider and continues to build momentum with both our Copper Alloys division and our Beralcast alloys produced at our Engineered Materials facility in Wilmington, MA. We are focused on supporting our customers and their commitment to manufacturing excellence."

 Advanced Alloy Companies Announce Joint Development Agreement on Scandium Applications Project 
 Wed, 06/22/2016 - 3:09pm 
 Comments 
 by MarketWired  

 






NioCorp Developments Ltd. and IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. announce that they have entered into a joint development agreement to investigate and develop applications for scandium-containing alloys for multiple downstream markets.
Scandium is a transition metal (element #21) that can provide many powerful benefits to industries such as commercial aviation, automotive, precision manufacturing, defense, electronics, and others. When alloyed with aluminum, for example, it can increase the strength and weldability of the aluminum used in commercial airliners, which in turn can reduce a plane's weight, fuel consumption, and emissions per passenger mile. ONG Commodities LLC ("ONG") has estimated that $1.0-$1.5 million of scandium oxide in a Boeing 737NG single-aisle airliner can offer $10-15 million of net present value in fuel savings alone. (Stimate is based on a B737NG flying 3000-4000 hours per year, and a long-term jet fuel price of $2-3/gallon. Savings potential is greater in long-haul aircraft with higher overall utilization.)
Scandium is scarcely used today because global production is severely constrained and unreliable. The U.S. Geological Survey recently estimated that only 10-15 tonnes (11-16 U.S. tons) per year of scandium are now produced. However, independent experts such as ONG estimate that latent demand in the aerospace and solid oxide fuel cell sectors alone is several hundred tonnes per year.

NioCorp expects to come online as one of the world's leading producers of scandium from its Elk Creek, Nebraska Superalloy Materials Project, potentially producing as much as 97 tonnes/year (106 tons/year). IBC is a leading advanced alloys company that produces high-performance alloys in a range of product forms for multiple industries and platforms, including cast components for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The joint development agreement announced today signals the companies' intent to collaborate in ensuring a reliable and secure U.S. supply of scandium and catalyzing greater scandium use across a variety of industries.
President of IBC Engineered Materials Chris Huskamp, will be leading the joint development effort for IBC. Huskamp is a former Boeing Associate Technical Fellow in advanced metallic processes who is credited as a named co-inventor of two pending patents regarding scandium-bearing aluminum alloys. The first pending patent can be seen here, and the second one can be seen here.
Scott Honan, VP of Business Development of NioCorp and president of Elk Creek Resources Corporation, will manage the initiative for NioCorp. Honan is leading the effort to develop and build NioCorp's niobium / scandium / titanium mine and processing facility in Nebraska, and has more than a decade of experience in producing advanced materials that are used in high-performance alloys.
"This joint development effort should deliver value both to NioCorp and IBC, and it highlights the powerful industrial logic of an upstream materials company jointly developing applications with a downstream advanced alloys producer like IBC," said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Executive Chairman of NioCorp. "NioCorp intends to establish a secure and reliable supply chain for scandium, and our partnership with IBC will leverage our ability to simultaneously accelerate applications development and market uptake of our scandium production."
"Advanced alloys are continuing to revolutionize many industries, and IBC's strategic goal is to catalyze new applications for scandium-containing alloys so that we can expand our markets beyond those we are now able to address with advanced beryllium and copper alloys," said Major General David "Duncan" Heinz (USMC, ret.), CEO of IBC. "The establishment of a reliable and secure scandium supply chain from NioCorp in the United States, coupled with our team's world-class experience with scandium-containing and other advanced alloys, make this joint development effort very attractive for our two companies and for U.S. industries as a whole."
"We intend to grow a whole new class of advanced products made here in the U.S from our superalloys," Heinz said. "Not only will IBC products help meet a growing market demand for advanced alloys, but they also will help address some of the world's greatest problems, such as climate change and reliance on fossil fuels. By providing greater strength and reduced weight, our advanced alloys increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions. They deliver real and measurable results today in the effort to tackle these enormous global challenges."

(TSX VENTURE:IB)(IAALF) ("IBC" or the "Company"), a leading beryllium and copper alloys company, announces today that it has completed the installation of a new Vacuum Induction Melting ("VIM") furnace in its Wilmington, MA manufacturing facility, where it produces beryllium-aluminum alloy products, and has commissioned the equipment with a successful first melt. The Company is now ramping up its production capacity in order to meet backlogged Beralcast® orders as well as a significant acceleration of component part orders from existing and new customers.Advanced automation and real time process monitoring have been integrated into this VIM furnace, thereby enabling a significant step-change in capability. With improved cycle time, the furnace is expected result in a 25% increase in the Company's daily melt capacity. Combined with additional shifts, reduced maintenance down-time, and expected yield improvements, this capital improvement should position IBC to significantly increase output over the next 12 months."This furnace is a world-class piece of equipment that will open up capacity and further refine our melting processes by providing a significant amount of time-correlated data for each mold we produce," according to Chris Huskamp, President of IBC Advanced Alloys Engineered Materials division."I'm very pleased with the extraordinary effort by our team to replace our legacy furnace with this new, cutting-edge production equipment," said Major General Duncan Heinz (USMC, ret.), President, CEO, and Director of IBC. "We elected to delay the installation of this unit in order to squeeze out additional product from our existing furnace so that we could meet rising customer demand for our Beralcast® material. The constraint for the Engineered Materials Division has been furnace throughput, not customer orders. Now, with this furnace up and running and certified, we can expand output, clear up our order backlog, and ramp up to meet growing market demand in our effort to reach our profitability goals."The beryllium-aluminum furnace is one of several components of the capital improvements program that IBC launched in June of 2016 following a C$7.46 million capital raise. In the Engineered Materials division, which manufactures beryllium-aluminum alloy products, other equipment upgrades that have been completed, or are being installed now, include a Digital Radiography Quality Control System and tumble blast finishing equipment.The Company's Copper Alloys division is also nearly complete in installing or upgrading production equipment at its Franklin, IN manufacturing facility, including a new solution annealing furnace, which is expected to facilitate expanded sales and revenue from current business lines as well as an expansion into new product lines.On Behalf of the Board of Directors:Duncan Heinz, President, CEO and DirectorAbout IBC Advanced Alloys Corp.
