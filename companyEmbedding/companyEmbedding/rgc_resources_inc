                      President and CFO

RGC 
                      RESOURCES, INC.
                      DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND


                      The Board of Directors of RGC Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: RGCO), 
                      at its meeting on March 23, 2015, declared a quarterly dividend 
                      of $0.1925 per share on the Company's common stock. The 
                      dividend will be paid on May 1, 2015 to shareholders of 
                      record on April 15, 2015. This is the Company's 284th consecutive 
                      quarterly cash dividend.

                      RGC Resources, Inc. provides energy and related products 
                      and services to customers in Virginia through its operating 
                      subsidiaries including Roanoke Gas Company, Diversified 
                      Energy Company and RGC Ventures of Virginia, Inc.

                      From time to time, the Company may publish forward-looking 
                      statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial 
                      performance, business prospects, technological developments, 
                      new products, research and development activities and similar 
                      matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
                      1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. 
                      In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, the 
                      Company notes that a variety of factors could cause the 
                      Company's actual results and experience to differ materially 
                      from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed 
                      in the Company's forward-looking statements.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

RGC Resources is a company headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia. It is a holding company that distributes and sells natural gas to customers in Virginia through its subsidiaries, Roanoke Gas. Roanoke Gas is the largest and most well-known subsidiary, which provides natural gas distribution to about 59,000 customers in the Roanoke metropolitan area and some other nearby areas such as eastern Montgomery County and western Bedford County. "RGC" comes from the initials for Roanoke Gas Company.

In 1994, the Highland Gas Marketing division was established to broker natural gas to several industrial transportation customers of Roanoke Gas.
History[edit]
Roanoke Gas Company was organized in 1883, one year after Roanoke became a city. Initially, the gas was primarily used for street lights and to light businesses such as the Hotel Roanoke. Gas was manufactured from coal with coke as a byproduct. In 1889, the Roanoke Gas Company and the Roanoke Water Works sold their assets to the Roanoke Gas and Water Company. On May 15, 1912, the Roanoke Gas Light Company was formed when the gas and water companies were separated again. The number of gas customers expanded rapidly with Roanoke's growth in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1939, the name of the gas company was changed from Roanoke Gas Light Company to Roanoke Gas Company. Natural gas via pipeline first came to Roanoke homes and businesses on August 26, 1950. In 1993, the city of Roanoke considered exercising an option under the franchise agreement with Roanoke Gas to assume ownership of the natural gas distribution lines through the city with the company only providing gas for the system. The company objected to this proposal and successfully organized public opposition which persuaded the city not to proceed. On July 1, 1999, Roanoke Gas and its subsidiaries were reorganized into the RGC Resources holding company.

RGC Resources is a company headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia. It is a holding company that distributes and sells natural gas to customers in Virginia through its subsidiaries, Roanoke Gas. Roanoke Gas is the largest and most well-known subsidiary, which provides natural gas distribution to about 59,000 customers in the Roanoke metropolitan area and some other nearby areas such as eastern Montgomery County and western Bedford County. "RGC" comes from the initials for Roanoke Gas Company.

In 1994, the Highland Gas Marketing division was established to broker natural gas to several industrial transportation customers of Roanoke Gas.
History[edit]
Roanoke Gas Company was organized in 1883, one year after Roanoke became a city. Initially, the gas was primarily used for street lights and to light businesses such as the Hotel Roanoke. Gas was manufactured from coal with coke as a byproduct. In 1889, the Roanoke Gas Company and the Roanoke Water Works sold their assets to the Roanoke Gas and Water Company. On May 15, 1912, the Roanoke Gas Light Company was formed when the gas and water companies were separated again. The number of gas customers expanded rapidly with Roanoke's growth in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1939, the name of the gas company was changed from Roanoke Gas Light Company to Roanoke Gas Company. Natural gas via pipeline first came to Roanoke homes and businesses on August 26, 1950. In 1993, the city of Roanoke considered exercising an option under the franchise agreement with Roanoke Gas to assume ownership of the natural gas distribution lines through the city with the company only providing gas for the system. The company objected to this proposal and successfully organized public opposition which persuaded the city not to proceed. On July 1, 1999, Roanoke Gas and its subsidiaries were reorganized into the RGC Resources holding company.
