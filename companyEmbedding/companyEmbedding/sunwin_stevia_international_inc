manufacturing capacity for more than 700 metric tons of Stevia in multiple 
grades to meet specific market and product needs.

The company continues to vertically integrate its operations. Sunwin is 
expanding its US presence as market interest in Stevia products increases 
through greater awareness of health issues and increasing demand for natural 
products. The recent approval by FDA for Stevia will open additional market 
opportunities.

Success in these efforts will grow company revenue, and diligent attention to 
cost of goods and raw materials will preserve and enhance profitability and cash 
generation to invest in future efforts.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

Non-GMO PVP is the fastest growing label in the natural products industry, representing $11 billion in annual sales and more than 27,000 verified products. With consumers today, the Non-GMO Project seal is the most trusted sign that a product comes from best practices for GMO avoidance.
Ms. Dongdong Lin, CEO of Sunwin Stevia stated, “Verified by the Non-GMO project means Sunwin Stevia’s products are free of any GMOs and can legally use the Non-GMO label to be sold in any green market. Management is very pleased that its stevia products have achieved Non-GMO verified status and passed the on-site inspection and document-based evaluation. Management believes that the potential to penetrate a multiple billion green market is substantial, as more and more people realize that natural products are better for our bodies, better for our communities, and better for the planet.”
