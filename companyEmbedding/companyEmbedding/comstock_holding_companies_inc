  About Comstock Holding Companies, Inc.   Comstock is a homebuilding and multi-faceted real estate development and services company that builds a wide range of housing products under its Comstock Homes brand through its wholly owned subsidiary, Comstock Homes of Washington, LC. Our track record of developing numerous successful new home communities and more than 5,500 homes, together with our substantial experience in building a diverse range of products including apartments, single-family homes, townhomes, mid-rise condominiums, high-rise condominiums and mixed-use (residential and commercial) developments has positioned Comstock as a leading residential developer and homebuilder in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Comstock is a publicly traded company, trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHCI. For more information about Comstock or its new home communities, please visit www.comstockhomes.com.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This release includes "forward-looking" statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "may," "intend," "expect," "will," "should," "potential," "seeks" or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speaks only as of the date made. Some factors which may affect the accuracy of the forward-looking statements apply generally to the real estate industry, while other factors apply directly to us. Any number of important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: general economic and market conditions, including interest rate levels; our ability to service our debt; inherent risks in investment in real estate; our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate; economic risks in the markets in which we operate, including actions related to government spending; delays in governmental approvals and/or land development activity at our projects; regulatory actions; fluctuations in operating results; our anticipated growth strategies; shortages and increased costs of labor or building materials; the availability and cost of land in desirable areas; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; our ability to raise debt and equity capital and grow our operations on a profitable basis; and our continuing relationships with affiliates. Additional information concerning these and other important risk and uncertainties can be found under the heading "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Our actual results could differ materially from these projected or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Comstock claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements contained herein. Comstock specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.                                                 Exhibit 1                              Settled Revenue by Community                                                       Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 (000's)         Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 (000's)     Community     Settled      Settled  Revenue         Community     Settled      Settled  Revenue     The Hampshires - Singles     5     $   3,782         Eastgate Villas     13     $   5,158     The Hampshires - Towns     9       4,992         The Hampshires - Singles     8       5,988     Falls Grove - Towns     10       3,053         The Hampshires - Towns     21       11,412     Maxwell Square     2       857         Falls Grove - Towns     29       8,757     Shady Grove - TH     9       5,541         Maxwell Square     2       857                               Shady Grove - TH     9       5,541     Total     35     $   18,225                                                         Total     82     $   37,713                                             Exhibit 2                              Backlog by Community                                                            As of September 30, 2014                     Community     Backlog Units      Backlog  Revenue                     The Hampshires - Singles     5     $   3,909                     The Hampshires - Towns     3       1,643                     Falls Grove - Singles     3       1,584                     Falls Grove - Towns     7       2,160                     Maxwell Square     7       2,938                     Shady Grove - TH     5       3,178                     Hallcrest - TH     1       484                                                           Total     31     $   15,896                                                             Exhibit 3   CHCI Homebuilding Pipeline                                                                                     Pipeline Report as of September 30, 2014     Project               State        Product Type(1)        EstimatedUnits atCompletion        UnitsSettled        UnitsOwnedUnsettled        Units UnderControl (2)        Total Units Ownedand Under Control        ProjectedRevenue PerUnit (000's)        Total ProjectedRevenue (000's)        Project Life(3)     City Homes at the Hampshires         DC     SF     38     28     10     -     10     725     $   7,250     2012-2015     Townes at the Hampshires (4)         DC     TH     73     34     39     -     39     525       20,475     2012-2015     Estates at Falls Grove         VA     SF     19     -     19     -     19     480       9,120     2013-2015     Townes at Falls Grove         VA     TH     110     29     81     -     81     300       24,300     2013-2016     Townes at Shady Grove Metro         MD     TH     36     9     27     -     27     625       16,875     2013-2015     Townes at Shady Grove Metro (5)         MD     SF     3     -     3     -     3     350       1,050     2015     Momentum | Shady Grove Metro (6)         MD     Condo     117     -     117     -     117     340       39,780     2015-2017     Estates at Emerald Farms         MD     SF     84     78     6     -     6     452       2,712     2015-2016     Townes at Maxwell Square         MD     TH     45     2     43     -     43     390       16,770     2014-2016     Townes at Hallcrest         VA     TH     42     -     42     -     42     455       19,110     2014-2015     Estates at Leeland         VA     SF     24     -     24     -     24     400       9,600     2014-2016     Villas | Preserve at Two Rivers 28'         MD     TH     66     -     -     66     66     425       28,050     2014-2018     Villas | Preserve at Two Rivers 32'         MD     TH     54     -     -     54     54     460       24,840     2014-2017     Villas at New Design Road         MD     TH     78     -     -     78     78     375       29,250     2016-2018     Estates at Popkins Lane         VA     SF     12     -     -     12     12     750       9,000     2015-2016     Townes at Richmond Station         VA     TH     70     -     -     70     70     365       25,550     2015-2018     Richmond Station Multi-family         VA     MF     103     -     -     103     103     320       32,960     2016-2019     Townes at Somerville               VA       TH       37       -       -       37       37       450           16,650       2016-2017     Total                               1,011       180       411       420       831               $   333,342                                                                    (1)        "SF" means single family home, "TH" means townhome, "Condo" means condominium, "MF" means multi-family.
