Financial recourse when hiring Miller, John T



Licensed contractors in Wisconsin are required to obtain a surety bond.In the event of losses or damages incurred during a construction project,a homeowner can file a claim against a contractors bond.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wisconsin, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.

BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Unlike most chiropractic, there is no pain from adjustments, there is no slamming your body down, bending you in half, etc.  Just relief.  In past years Dr. Rogers has implemented state of the art technology with the ProAdjuster making manual adjustments a thing of the past. One of the great features of this technology is the ability to track progress, and allow the patient to visually see what is going on rather than just feeling the relief.  Dr. Rogers also makes the environment friendly and comforting, while informative at the same time.  From day 1 she finds out your needs and wants, and creates a plan to get you there.  If you haven't stopped by yet, make sure you do. You won't regret it!Davis Chiropractic Centerrustyfulling ratedHeadache free!“AMAZING!!” I had recently been fighting a nagging headache for almost 2 weeks. Over-the-counter medicine seemed to provide little relief. Late Friday afternoon I stopped by Dr. Rogers office just to say “Hi” on my way to the KCI airport. She graciously worked me into her schedule and within minutes she was able to diagnose the headache issue and make the pain free adjustment with her computerized ProAdjuster system. I'm not one that normally believes in quick fixes, especially when it comes to healthcare but I'm truly impressed with the results and patient care provided by Dr. Rogers. – signed Headache FreeDavis Chiropractic CenterAaron L. rated Dr. Rogers is amazing and has changed my outlook on chiropractic. I used to be a little afraid because I thought chiropractic was popping and snapping of the neck but with Dr. Rogers it is not like that at all. She has extremely non-invasive technology that gets the same results as standard chiropractic but in very little time and zero pain or discomfort. She is a great person and has helped me and my mother out so much and we are really grateful to her. Insurance covers her treatments and they are very effective.Body in Balance Chiropracticmsmith72 ratedSimply Impressed!   I have bee...Simply Impressed!   I have been to chiropractors in the past but have never felt long term improvement until I found Dr. Jameson  Body in Balance is truly not an understatement, Dr. Jameson not only adjusted my spine he also adjusted my shoulders and spent some time teaching me how to stretch and corrected some things in my exercise regime that were contributing to the problem.  He is also a provider for Blue Cross & Blue Shield so my insurance covers my care and I didn't need a referral from a medical doctor. Davis Chiropractic Centeralice.c.zvacek ratedThere are not enough good word...There are not enough good words to say about Dr. June Rogers. Some of the words that come to mind are caring, capable, honest, hard-working. I could go on for a long time. My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Rogers for over 20 years. I have always found her to have the utmost integrity. She is very knowledgeable as a Chiropractor and has a passion for helping people to feel better. I would recommend Dr. Rogers without reservation.Lundin Chiropracticrparshall1 ratedIndividual CareYears ago I left a chiropractor because it seemed as though his goal was to get as many patience in and out the door per hour as possible. He failed to understand that adjustments are a service and not a product. It's about people and the personal interest you take in helping ease their pain. Dr. Amy understands this and I take my whole family there. We now get the treatment we deserve!Lifestyle Chiropractic - Dr. Shelley Hooks DCBob E. ratedDr. Shelley Hooks is the best! I've worked with many other Chiropractors throughout my career but Dr. Hooks takes the time to listen and examine each problem.  She is then able to make adjustments and set up care that it second to none.  If you're having a problem, do yourself a favor and give her a call.  She and her staff will take very good care of you. Davis Chiropractic Centertezcolbert ratedDr Rogers Dr. Rogers is my first Chiropractic Doctor as soon as i walked in she made me feel welcome she  told  me  that her goal was to get me Better  so far i am very impressed with only 3 treatments she has outlined  what we will be doing now,and where we want to finish at  i recommend her to everyone especially if your fearful she is very NICE!!!!!!!!Emmanuel Chiropractic ClinicRachel P. ratedI came two weeks prior the staff change, and the difference with the new staff is tremendous! The office is organized, the new staff is friendly, and the place smells good! My interaction with the Doctor was like no other. I've never been treated with so much care and respect. I highly recommend this clinicWaldo Wellness Group Inctrubin ratedWaldo Wellness Group is the best! They have helped me manage my neck pain and i feel like a new person. Their office staff is friendly and the doctors really make you feel welcome and comfortable. I would definitely recommend Waldo Wellness Group to anyone!

                              Laser transmission through a snowfield has been measured in a laboratory experiment. Simultaneous measurements of the attenuation
                                 of a 0.6328- and a 10.6-micrometer wavelength laser beam by a common snowfield are reported. The results are favorably compared
                                 with a prediction of an analytic model which treats the snowflakes as spheres. The analytic model is then restructured and
                                 applied to predict the attenuation which would be obtained in a natural snowfield. (Author)

                              Measurements of average heat-transfer rates to blunt-nosed, axisymmetric, cold-walled bodies in a low-density, hypervelocity
                                 wind tunnel are given. Stream density was such that Reynolds and Knudsen numbers, based on nose radius and conditions immediately
                                 behind the bow shock, varied from 5 to 20 and 0.11 to 0.056, respectively. Thus, scaling on the basis of Knudsen number, these
                                 conditions may be said to simulate a body of one-foot nose radius at as much as 315,500-ft altitude. Heat-transfer rates are
                                 discussed in relation to the flow model successfully used in the past for studies of flows of high Reynolds number. In this
                                 context, it was found that measured heat-transfer rates to hemispheres below shock-layer Reynolds numbers of 20 exhibited
                                 a decreasing nondimensionalized rate relative to that estimated by methods appropriate to high Reynolds number conditions.
                                 This behavior is in accord with various applicable theories. Rates for the flat-faced bodies showed no tendency to decrease,
                                 and they were somewhat higher than predicted by theories for high Reynolds numbers

All About Liquor

Unless you're lining up a bunch of shots, liquor takes a little more work than cracking a beer or pouring a glass of wine. However, the effort is well worth the result if you've picked up the right bottle. Enjoy the sophisticated complexity of whiskey all on its own or create an amazing gin cocktail. Impress your guests with a digestif or get the party started with a batch of margaritas. You can find a different liquor brand or cocktail to suit every occasion. Plus, being able to whip up a delicious cocktail will never not impress your guests.
Whiskey:
With a diverse array of flavors, you can try a different whiskey or bourbon every night and never get bored. It tastes great straight from the glass, though you can dress it up with flavored soda, sparkling water or other mixers. Try light and dark whiskeys to experience the full spectrum of notes, from fruity and light to bitter, spicy and dark.
Vodka:
Although higher-end vodka can taste wonderful straight from the shot glass or tumbler, it's perfect for cocktails. When you crave spicy, whip up a batch of bloody marys — and don't skimp on the hot sauce. A vodka martini tastes great with a few olives, while a Cosmopolitan will satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth and a penchant for "Sex and the City" marathons.
Tequila:
It's best known for its inclusion in popular cocktails, from margaritas and tequila sunrises to Joan Collinses and tequila sours. It's also perfect as an apéritif when mixed with simple tonic. Choose a lighter-colored tequila for this cocktail, and don't forget to add plenty of crushed ice.
Brandy:
If you want to impress someone, keep a bottle of good brandy on hand. It's best served neat in a well-rounded snifter, though a simple tumbler works too. To experience the full array of rich flavors, hold the glass between your hands to warm the liquid inside. Like wine, brandy often tastes best after you take a good whif, so don't forget to sniff before you lift the glass to your lips.
Gin:
This humble liquor has been popular for centuries thanks to its fairly simple taste. If you're planning a party, collect the recipe ingredients necessary for gin martinis, gimlets, Tom Collinses, and Singapore slings. Of course, it also tastes great with a splash of soda on the rocks.
Start searching around to buy liquor online, whether it's a fancy bottle to impress your in-laws or some mini liquor bottles to take on your next flight.

All About Wine

Whether you're dedicated to your signature wines or you're looking for a new bottle that'll blow your mind, you'll find all the wine you've ever dreamed of right here. Find out why we consider ourselves a wine lover's paradise and discover why Drizly is the best place to shop for everything from your everyday table wine to your special occasion bottles.
Red Wines:
If you can't tell a Syrah from a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Rioja from a Bordeaux, there still might be hope for you yet. Discover the cherry and cassis notes in a great bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon or start sipping an easy-to-drink Merlot. But don't just stay in the Old World — go beyond just France and try some of our bestselling bottles of Australian Shiraz, Argentinian Malbec and Spanish Rioja.
White Wines:
If you've never met a glass of white wine you didn't love, start sipping your way through our vast selection to find your new fave. From full-bodied Chardonnay to crisp Riesling to refreshing Pinot Grigio, we have the perfect bottle so you can make your own happy hour. Try bottles of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or South Africa, Chardonnay from California or Australia or Gewürztraminer from Germany or France. You'll totally feel like a world traveler just from your couch!
Sparkling Wines:
Whether you're celebrating an anniversary, a major milestone at work or just the end of a great day, you need the perfect sparkling wine. For the uninitiated, bubbly goes way beyond Champagne. Sure, this French varietal is the most famous type of sparkling wine. But if you'd rather try a pleasant Prosecco or a Catalonian Cava, we have just the bottle of bubbly for you. A popped cork makes your day more poppin'. True story.
Rosé Wines:
On a warm summer day, nothing hits the spot like a glass of rosé. Don't be scared off by the color — real heroes love pink. Try a dry, full-bodied bottle from Côtes de Provence and feel like you're that much closer to your dream of horseback riding through the French countryside. Or save a bottle of sparkling rosé for when you really need your special occasion to stand out from all those other basic bubblies.
Dessert Wines:
The next time you want to finish your meal with a little something sweet, skip that crème brûlée and go for a glass of dessert wine instead. Know you're the classiest person around with a glass of Port and Sherry, or sweeten the deal with our extensive selection of Amontillado or yes, even Vermouth.

All About Beer

It's good to have beers around. In the fridge. At the office. In the cooler. Not so much in the car. But almost everywhere else. It's like a comfort blanket for adults. And there are so many different beer types, you'll never get bored. Fancy beers, cheap beers, flavorful beers, light beers—they've all got their time and place. That place mostly being in our hearts.
Top Trending Styles of Beer:
IPA:
If you dig hops, India Pale Ale is your beer. Legend says British brewers packed extra hops into beer before the long voyage to India. Is it true? Who cares? Drink it. IPAs vary from a gentle hop handshake to a sock in the eye. Dry-hopped versions are made from preserved hops and are sharper. Fresh/wet hopped brews are made right after harvest, featuring a more floral nose and hints of apricot.
Lager:
The classic golden brew from bottom-fermenting yeast is typically clean and light in flavor. Clarity is its trademark, but some include dark caramelized malt that produces a black lager mellower than porter or stout. Rare India Pale Lagers feature big hop aromas but finish softer than their ale cousins. However, most lagers are easy-drinking fishing brews that defy beer snobbery, pair nicely with each other and are served best in a cooler full of ice.
Cider:
While cider is jumping out of nowhere in the U.S., it's always been big in the UK, which is the world's biggest cider consumer. They can be made from any kind of apple, and even pears, but high-sugar cider apples are best. They range from crystal clear to murky and brown. Most sparkle, but some are still. Cider is a good choice for those concerned about wheat. Be sure to choose a pure one not blended with ale.
Ale:
"Pale" refers to the color of malt, as opposed to "amber" or "dark." Malt dried slowly without caramelization is pale. The drying process was tough to control centuries ago, so heavily roasted malts were the rule. Now pale malts are easier to make. They produce beers that balance full body and crisp refreshment. Pale ales sparked the American microbrewery revolution of the past couple of decades. Although not born here, pale ales are now as American as hot dogs.
Stout:
The baby born of deeply caramelized malt, stout is dark as a black hole with a full mouthfeel and a head you can chew. They range from creamy/chocolatey/malty to cocoa/espresso/tobacco. While some are as strong as they look with ABV of over 8 percent, others are deceptively light. The most famous stout, Guinness, has less alcohol and fewer calories than most golden brews, making it the perfect lunch beverage. Nitrogenization gives it a velvety texture.
Beer Myths 101:

Cold to warm and back again will skunk beer: Nope. Temperature won't corrupt your beer, but light will. If you're running out of room in the fridge, feel free to remove some beers without worrying. Just don't store them in your trunk during the summer.
Bottles > Cans: Again, nope. We just talked about this. Light is bad for your beer and cans are better at keeping it out. They're also better at keeping oxygen out, which is also no friend of beer.
Stouts are heavy and boozy: Appearances can be deceiving. Stouts might look like a lot to handle, but they're surprisingly light. Guinness actually has less calories and alcohol than Budweiser.
