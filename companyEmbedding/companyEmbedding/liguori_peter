Peter's Catechism: Who do you say that I am? Why did you doubt? Do you love me?

Hosffman Ospino


Quick Overview

To be human is to ask questions. Some questions emerge from the context in which we live; others are lasting questions that we cannot escape because they shape our own identity. Peter's Catechism is an invitation for Christians to revisit the three questions Jesus asked the apostle Peter in the Scriptures: Who do you say that I am? Why did you doubt? Do you love me?
All three questions are simultaneously particular and lasting: particular because they demand a personal answer from us in the here and now of our existences; lasting because they point to the heart of what it means to be Christian. Peter's Catechism is an excellent resource for adult faith formation and for Christians seeking to rekindle the passion for their faith by entering into conversation with other Christian voices and better engaging the context in which we live today. Dr. Hosffman Ospino, Director of Graduate Programs in Hispanic Ministry, is an Assistant Professor in the School of Theology and Ministry. Dr. Ospino was born in Colombia where he pursued undergraduate studies in Philosophy. He taught philosophy and religion at various academic levels and worked for the National Confederation of Catholic Education of Colombia. He holds an M.A. in Theology with concentration in Church History and a Ph.D. in Theology and Education from Boston College. Dr. Ospino’s research concentrates on the dialogue between theology and culture and the impact of this interchange upon Catholic theological education, catechesis, and ministry. He has lectured nationally and internationally on these areas. He and his wife, Guadalupe, are actively involved in Hispanic Ministry in Boston.

      Sidelights
    

      Peter Liguori took over the reins of the FX television network in 1998.
      Since then he has worked tirelessly to create a niche for the small cable
      channel as it attempts to find a place in the competitive world of
      ad-supported cable networks. As a member 
      

          Peter Liguori 
          
        

       of the much larger Fox-Liberty Networks group of media outlets, FX has
      been able to take its time finding a share of the audience. When he first
      joined the station, like its competitors USA, TNT, and TBS, FX was the
      final resting ground for popular reruns. Liguori had a different vision
      for FX. His goal was to increase viewership, particularly among men in
      their mid-20s to late-30s, in order to compete with established networks.
      With that goal in mind, Liguori went in search for original programming
      produced by and for the station that would intrigue and delight viewers.
    
    
      After a couple years of false starts, Liguori found the right combination
      of violence, intrigue, and creativity in the police drama 
      
        The Shield.
      
       Audiences either loved or hated the show. Critics praised the gritty
      drama about a police officer who most often operates on the wrong side of
      the law. Advertisers feared the public backlash against the violent
      content, and in its first year, ads were pulled. But Liguori had
      confidence in the show and kept with it. That confidence paid off in 2002
      when the show's star, Michael Chiklis, won an Emmy for Best Actor
      in a Series. The award was the most prestigious ever given to a
      basic-cable show. The following year Chiklis won a Golden Globe for best
      actor, and the series won for best drama. Liguori was beginning to reap
      huge benefits for his risk. Speaking to 
      
        Mediaweek,
      
       Liguori commented on the success of 
      
        The Shield
      
       and what it meant for the future of FX, "It takes a long time to
      entrench a brand in TV, and I have no illusions that we have cemented one.
      We have just taken the first few steps, but it's a damn shame if we
      don't use this opportunity."
    

      Born on July 6, 1960, Liguori grew up in the Bronx, New York, with his
      parents and members of his extended family. He told Joe Schlosser of 
      
        Broadcasting & Cable,
      
       "It was the quintessential extended immigrant family. It was a
      warm, fun environment." His father worked two jobs until his death
      when Liguori was 16. Liguori's father was committed to having his
      son go to college and emphasized academic achievement. Liguori explained
      to Schlosser, "There were few things that were uncompromised in our
      family, but one thing was absolute: grades." At Harry S. Truman
      High School, Liguori made the grades and ended up graduating valedictorian
      of his class.
    

      Possessed of an interest and ability in business, Liguori went to college
      at Yale University. By his sophomore year, he was running the on-campus
      laundry service. He graduated in 1982 with a degree in history. When he
      graduated he was hired by Procter & Gamble, for whom he worked for
      about a year. The job at Procter & Gamble proved boring and
      unchallenging and was located in the suburb of Wilton, Connecticut.
      Liguori grew tired of working on projects for products like denture
      adhesives and left the job after only a year. He was drawn to New York and
      moved there to work for the advertising agency of Saatchi &
      Saatchi.
    

      Because his father had wanted him to be a lawyer, Liguori moved to Chicago
      in 1985 to attend Northwestern University's law school. He dropped
      out after only one semester because he realized he wanted to be in the
      film business. Just before his finals he had seen the film 
      
        Once Upon a Time in America.
      
       He explained to 
      
        Broadcasting & Cable
      
      's Schlosser, "I fell in love with the movie and found a bit
      of a calling." Liguori finished his semester at Northwestern and
      then returned to New York hoping to get into movies.
    

      Liguori did not get into the film business immediately upon his return to
      New York; he spent a few more years in advertising, including a return to
      Saatchi & Saatchi and a stint at Ogilvy & Mather, another
      large advertising firm. In 1988, his chance to get into the film business
      came when he was offered a position with HBO in the marketing department
      of their newly formed home video division. He started out as director of
      marketing and by 1994, he had become senior vice president of marketing.
      In 1994, he moved to the position of vice president of marketing for all
      of HBO. He held the position for two years before Fox-Liberty Networks
      hired him as senior vice president of marketing and promotion.
    

      In 1998, Liguori was named president of FX Networks. Three years later, in
      2001, during one the most dismal years for the entertainment industry, in
      the midst of layoffs and cutbacks, Liguori was named chief executive
      officer and given a five-year contract. That year FX was in the top 10 of
      favorite cable stations among adults between 18 and 49. By 2004, Tim
      Goodman of the 
      
        San Francisco Chronicle
      
       argued that FX ranked as the number five network in television, coming in
      after ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC. Using well-performing shows such as 
      
        The Shield, Nip/Tuck,
      
       and 
      
        Rescue Me
      
       as examples, Goodman stated, "[T]here is no more wondering out
      loud about whether FX has been extremely lucky and stumbled upon two
      quality dramas in some flukefilled guessing game. Three is a trend
      ."
    

      In 2003, Liguori was listed as one of 
      
        Entertainment Weekly
      
      's most powerful people in the entertainment industry in their 14th
      annual Power Issue. The magazine cited his ability to transform FX from a
      rerun station to a presenter of high-quality, envelope-pushing weekly
      drama series. As he has risen to prominence and power in the entertainment
      industry, Liguori—who is married and has two kids—claims
      that he tries to always remember his roots. He explained to Schlosser,
      "[P]art of what I am in terms of being a programmer is rooted in my
      experiences growing up in the Bronx."
