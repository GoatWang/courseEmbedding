The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

participate in the same investment
opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program where such
participation would otherwise be
prohibited under section 17 of the Act;
and (b) make additional investments in
securities of such issuers (‘‘Follow-On
Investments’’), including through the
exercise of warrants, conversion
privileges, and other rights to purchase
securities of the issuers. ‘‘Co-Investment
Transaction’’ means any transaction in
which a Regulated Entity (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary, as
defined below) participated together
with one or more other Regulated
Entities and/or Affiliated Funds in
reliance on the requested Order.
‘‘Potential Co-Investment Transaction’’
means any investment opportunity in
which a Regulated Entity (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiaries) could
not participate together with one or
more other Regulated Entities and/or
one or more Affiliated Funds without
obtaining and relying on the Order.5
10. Applicants state that a Regulated
Entity may, from time to time, form one
or more Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiaries.6 Such a subsidiary would
be prohibited from investing in a CoInvestment Transaction with any other
Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund
because it would be a company
controlled by its parent Regulated Entity
for purposes of rule 17d-1. Applicants
request that each Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary be permitted to
participate in Co-Investment
Transactions in lieu of its parent
Regulated Entity and that the WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary’s
participation in any such transaction be
treated, for purposes of the Order, as
though the parent Regulated Entity were
and is advised by an Adviser. The term ‘‘Adviser’’
means any Existing NB Adviser or any Regulated
Entity Adviser. No Affiliated Fund is or will be a
subsidiary of a Regulated Entity.
5 All existing entities that currently intend to rely
upon the requested Order have been named as
applicants. Any other existing or future entity that
subsequently relies on the Order will comply with
the terms and conditions of the application.
6 The term ‘‘Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiary’’ means an entity: (a) That is whollyowned by a Regulated Entity (with such Regulated
Entity at all times holding, beneficially and of
record, 100% of the voting and economic interests);
(b) whose sole business purpose is to hold one or
more investments on behalf of such Regulated
Entity; (c) with respect to which the board of
directors of such Regulated Entity has the sole
authority to make all determinations with respect
to the entity’s participation under the conditions of
the application; and (d) that would be an
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the Act. All subsidiaries participating in
Co-Investment Transactions will be Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiaries and will have Objectives
and Strategies (as defined below) that are either the
same as, or a subset of, their parent Regulated
Entity’s Objectives and Strategies.

Jkt 241001

participating directly. Applicants
represent that this treatment is justified
because a Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiary would have no purpose
other than serving as a holding vehicle
for the Regulated Entity’s investments
and, therefore, no conflicts of interest
could arise between the Regulated
Entity and the Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated
Entity’s Board would make all relevant
determinations under the conditions
with regard to a Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary’s participation in
a Co-Investment Transaction, and the
Regulated Entity’s Board would be
informed of, and take into
consideration, any proposed use of a
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary
in the Regulated Entity’s place. If the
Regulated Entity proposes to participate
in the same Co-Investment Transaction
with any of its Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will
also be informed of, and take into
consideration, the relative participation
of the Regulated Entity and the WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary.
11. When considering Potential CoInvestment Transactions for any
Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser
will consider only the Objectives and
Strategies,7 investment policies,
investment positions, capital available
for investment, and other pertinent
factors applicable to that Regulated
Entity. The Advisers expect that any
portfolio company that is an appropriate
investment for a Regulated Entity
should also be an appropriate
investment for one or more other
Regulated Entities and/or one or more
Affiliated Funds, with certain
exceptions based on available capital or
diversification.8
12. Other than pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as provided
in conditions 7 and 8, and after making
the determinations required in
conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable
Adviser will present each Potential CoInvestment Transaction and the
proposed allocation to the directors of
the Board eligible to vote on that CoInvestment Transaction (the ‘‘Eligible
Directors’’) 9 and the majority of such
7 The term ‘‘Objectives and Strategies’’ means a
Regulated Entity’s investment objectives and
strategies as described in the Regulated Entity’s
registration statement on Form N–2, other filings
the Regulated Entity has made with the
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
‘‘Securities Act’’) or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and the Regulated Entity’s reports to
shareholders.
8 The Regulated Entities, however, will not be
obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment
opportunities are referred to them.
9 Eligible Directors may not have a financial
interest in such transaction, plan, or arrangement.

managers of the Board who are
Independent Managers (a ‘‘Required
Majority’’) will approve each CoInvestment Transaction prior to any
investment by the participating
Regulated Entity.
13. With respect to the pro rata
dispositions and Follow-On Investments
provided in conditions 7 and 8, a
Regulated Entity may participate in a
pro rata disposition or Follow-On
Investment without obtaining prior
approval of the Required Majority if,
among other things: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Entity
and each Affiliated Fund in such
disposition is proportionate to its
outstanding investments in the issuer
immediately preceding the disposition
or Follow-On Investment, as the case
may be; and (ii) the Board of the
Regulated Entity has approved that
Regulated Entity’s participation in pro
rata dispositions and Follow-On
Investments as being in the best
interests of the Regulated Entity. If the
Board does not so approve, any such
disposition or Follow-On Investment
will be submitted to the Regulated
Entity’s Eligible Directors. The Board of
any Regulated Entity may at any time
rescind, suspend or qualify its approval
of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On
Investments with the result that all
dispositions and/or Follow-On
Investments must be submitted to the
Eligible Directors.
14. No Independent Manager of a
Regulated Entity will have a direct or
indirect financial interest in any CoInvestment Transaction (other than
indirectly through share ownership in
one of the Regulated Entities), including
any interest in any company whose
securities would be acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction.
15. Under condition 15, if an Adviser,
its principals, or any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser or its principals, and
the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the
‘‘Holders’’) own in the aggregate more
than 25 percent of the outstanding
voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the
‘‘Shares’’), then the Holders will vote
such Shares as directed by an
independent third party when voting on
matters specified in the condition.
Applicants believe that this condition
will ensure that the Independent
Managers will act independently in
evaluating the co-investment program,
because the ability of an Adviser or its
principals to influence the Independent
Managers by a suggestion, explicit or
implied, that the Independent Managers
can be removed will be limited
significantly. Applicants represent that
the Independent Managers will evaluate

E:\FR\FM\14APN1.SGM

14APN1

18026

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 71 / Friday, April 14, 2017 / Notices

and approve any such independent
third party, taking into account its
qualifications, reputation for
independence, cost to the Regulated
Entity’s shareholders, and other factors
that they deem relevant.

Applicants’ Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit affiliated
persons of a registered investment
company from participating in joint
transactions with the company unless
the Commission has granted an order
permitting such transactions. In passing
upon applications under rule 17d–1, the
Commission considers whether the
company’s participation in the joint
transaction is consistent with the
provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act and the extent to which such
participation is on a basis different from
or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence
of the requested relief, the Regulated
Entities may be, in some circumstances,
limited in their ability to participate in
attractive and appropriate investment
opportunities. Applicants believe that
the proposed terms and conditions will
ensure that the Co-Investment
Transactions are consistent with the
protection of each Regulated Entity’s
shareholders and with the purposes
intended by the policies and provisions
of the Act. Applicants state that the
Regulated Entities’ participation in the
Co-Investment Transactions will be
consistent with the provisions, policies,
and purposes of the Act and on a basis
that is not different from or less
advantageous than that of other
participants.
Applicants’ Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will
be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a
Potential Co-Investment Transaction for
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund that falls within a Regulated
Entity’s then-current Objectives and
Strategies, the Regulated Entity’s
Adviser will make an independent
determination of the appropriateness of
the investment for the Regulated Entity
in light of the Regulated Entity’s thencurrent circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated
Entity’s participation in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction to be
appropriate for the Regulated Entity, the
Adviser will then determine an
appropriate level of investment for the
Regulated Entity.
(b) If the aggregate amount
recommended by the applicable Adviser
to be invested by the applicable

VerDate Sep<11>2014

16:21 Apr 13, 2017

Jkt 241001

Regulated Entity in the Potential CoInvestment Transaction together with
the amount proposed to be invested by
the other participating Regulated
Entities and Affiliated Funds,
collectively, in the same transaction,
exceeds the amount of the investment
opportunity, the investment opportunity
will be allocated among them pro rata
based on each participant’s capital
available for investment in the asset
class being allocated, up to the amount
proposed to be invested by each. The
applicable Adviser will provide the
Eligible Directors of each participating
Regulated Entity with information
concerning each participating party’s
available capital to assist the Eligible
Directors with their review of the
Regulated Entity’s investments for
compliance with these allocation
procedures.
(c) After making the determinations
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
applicable Adviser will distribute
written information concerning the
Potential Co-Investment Transaction
(including the amount proposed to be
invested by each Regulated Entity and
each Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible
Directors of each participating
Regulated Entity for their consideration.
A Regulated Entity will co-invest with
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund only if, prior to the Regulated
Entity’s participation in the Potential
Co-Investment Transaction, a Required
Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, including the
consideration to be paid, are reasonable
and fair to the Regulated Entity and its
investors and do not involve
overreaching in respect of the Regulated
Entity or its investors on the part of any
person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment
Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the Regulated
Entity’s investors; and
(B) the Regulated Entity’s then-current
Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other
Regulated Entities or any Affiliated
Funds would not disadvantage the
Regulated Entity, and participation by
the Regulated Entity would not be on a
basis different from or less advantageous
than that of any other Regulated Entities
or any Affiliated Funds; provided that,
if any other Regulated Entity or any
Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated
Entity itself, gains the right to nominate
a director for election to a portfolio
company’s board of directors or the
right to have a board observer or any
similar right to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company, such event shall not

PO 00000

Frm 00060

Fmt 4703

be interpreted to prohibit the Required
Majority from reaching the conclusions
required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have
the right to ratify the selection of such
director or board observer, if any; and
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to,
and does, provide periodic reports to
the Board of the Regulated Entity with
respect to the actions of such director or
the information received by such board
observer or obtained through the
exercise of any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company;
and
(C) any fees or other compensation
that any Regulated Entity or any
Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person
of any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated
Fund receives in connection with the
right of a Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund to nominate a director
or appoint a board observer or otherwise
to participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company
will be shared proportionately among
the participating Affiliated Funds (who
may each, in turn, share its portion with
its affiliated persons) and the
participating Regulated Entities in
accordance with the amount of each
party’s investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the
Regulated Entity will not benefit any
Adviser, the other Regulated Entities,
the Affiliated Funds or any affiliated
person of any of them (other than the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction), except (A) to the extent
permitted by condition 13, (B) to the
extent permitted by section 17(e) of the
Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a
result of an interest in the securities
issued by one of the parties to the CoInvestment Transaction, or (D) in the
case of fees or other compensation
described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Entity has the right
to decline to participate in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction or to invest
less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present
to the Board of each Regulated Entity,
on a quarterly basis, a record of all
investments in Potential Co-Investment
Transactions made by any of the other
Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds
during the preceding quarter that fell
within the Regulated Entity’s thencurrent Objectives and Strategies that
were not made available to the
Regulated Entity, and an explanation of
why the investment opportunities were
not offered to the Regulated Entity. All
information presented to the Board
pursuant to this condition will be kept
for the life of the Regulated Entity and
at least two years thereafter, and will be

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 71 / Friday, April 14, 2017 / Notices
subject to examination by the
Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments
made in accordance with condition 8,10
a Regulated Entity will not invest in
reliance on the Order in any issuer in
which another Regulated Entity,
Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person
of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated
Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Entity will not
participate in any Potential CoInvestment Transaction unless the
terms, conditions, price, class of
securities to be purchased, settlement
date, and registration rights will be the
same for each participating Regulated
Entity and Affiliated Fund. The grant to
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund, but not the Regulated Entity, of
the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors, the right to have an
observer on the board of directors or
similar rights to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company will not be
interpreted so as to violate this
condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B)
and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of an interest in a
security that was acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction, the applicable
Adviser will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed disposition
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
participation by each Regulated Entity
in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Entity will have
the right to participate in such
disposition on a proportionate basis, at
the same price and on the same terms
and conditions as those applicable to
the participating Regulated Entities and
Affiliated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Entity may participate
in such disposition without obtaining
prior approval of the Required Majority
if: (i) The proposed participation of each
Regulated Entity and each Affiliated
Fund in such disposition is
proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board
of the Regulated Entity has approved as
being in the best interests of the
Regulated Entity the ability to
participate in such dispositions on a pro
rata basis (as described in greater detail
10 This exception applies only to Follow-On
Investments by a Regulated Entity in issuers in
which that Regulated Entity already holds

in the application); and (iii) the Board
of the Regulated Entity is provided on
a quarterly basis with a list of all
dispositions made in accordance with
this condition. In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Entity’s participation to the Regulated
Entity’s Eligible Directors, and the
Regulated Entity will participate in such
disposition solely to the extent that a
Required Majority determines that it is
in the Regulated Entity’s best interests.
(d) Each Regulated Entity and each
Affiliated Fund will bear its own
expenses in connection with any such
disposition.
8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund desires to make a
Follow-On Investment in a portfolio
company whose securities were
acquired in a Co-Investment
Transaction, the applicable Adviser
will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed transaction
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
the proposed participation, including
the amount of the proposed Follow-On
Investment, by each Regulated Entity.
(b) A Regulated Entity may participate
in such Follow-On Investment without
obtaining prior approval of the Required
Majority if: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Entity
and each Affiliated Fund in such
investment is proportionate to its
outstanding investments in the issuer
immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and (ii) the Board of the
Regulated Entity has approved as being
in the best interests of the Regulated
Entity the ability to participate in
Follow-On Investments on a pro rata
basis (as described in greater detail in
the application). In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Entity’s participation to the Eligible
Directors, and the Regulated Entity will
participate in such Follow-On
Investment solely to the extent that a
Required Majority determines that it is
in the Regulated Entity’s best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On
Investment:
(i) The amount of a Follow-On
Investment is not based on the
Regulated Entities’ and the Affiliated
Funds’ outstanding investments
immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount
recommended by the Adviser to be
invested by each Regulated Entity in the
Follow-On Investment, together with
the amount proposed to be invested by

the participating Affiliated Funds in the
same transaction, exceeds the amount of
the opportunity; then the amount
invested by each such party will be
allocated among them pro rata based on
each party’s capital available for
investment in the asset class being
allocated, up to the amount proposed to
be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On
Investments as permitted by this
condition will be considered a CoInvestment Transaction for all purposes
and subject to the other conditions set
forth in the application.
9. The Independent Managers of each
Regulated Entity will be provided
quarterly for review all information
concerning Potential Co-Investment
Transactions and Co-Investment
Transactions, including investments
made by other Regulated Entities and
the Affiliated Funds that the Regulated
Entity considered but declined to
participate in, so that the Independent
Managers may determine whether all
investments made during the preceding
quarter, including those investments
which the Regulated Entity considered
but declined to participate in, comply
with the conditions of the Order. In
addition, the Independent Managers
will consider at least annually the
continued appropriateness for the
Regulated Entity of participating in new
and existing Co-Investment
Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Entity will
maintain the records required by section
57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the
Regulated Entities were a business
development company (as defined in
section 2(a)(48) of the Act) and each of
the investments permitted under these
conditions were approved by the
Required Majority under section 57(f) of
the Act.
11. No Independent Manager of a
Regulated Entity will also be a director,
general partner, managing member or
principal, or otherwise an ‘‘affiliated
person’’ (as defined in the Act) of an
Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated
with acquiring, holding or disposing of
any securities acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction (including,
without limitation, the expenses of the
distribution of any such securities
registered for sale under the Securities
Act) will, to the extent not payable by
an Adviser under the investment
advisory agreements with the Regulated
Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be
shared by the Affiliated Funds and the
Regulated Entities in proportion to the
relative amounts of the securities held
or to be acquired or disposed of, as the
case may be.

13. Any transaction fee 11 (including
break-up or commitment fees but
excluding broker’s fees contemplated by
section 17(e) of the Act, as applicable),
received in connection with a CoInvestment Transaction will be
distributed to the participating
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds
on a pro rata basis based on the amounts
they invested or committed, as the case
may be, in such Co-Investment
Transaction. If any transaction fee is to
be held by the Adviser pending
consummation of the transaction, the
fee will be deposited into an account
maintained by the Adviser at a bank or
banks having the qualifications
prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act,
and the account will earn a competitive
rate of interest that will also be divided
pro rata among the participating
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds
based on the amounts they invest in
such Co-Investment Transaction. None
of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers,
the other Regulated Entities or any
affiliated person of the Regulated
Entities or Affiliated Funds will receive
additional compensation or
remuneration of any kind as a result of
or in connection with a Co-Investment
Transaction (other than (a) in the case
of the Regulated Entities and the
Affiliated Funds, the pro rata
transaction fees described above and
fees or other compensation described in
condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case
of the Advisers, investment advisory
fees paid in accordance with the
agreements between the Advisers and
the Regulated Entities or the Affiliated
Funds).
14. The Advisers will each maintain
policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure compliance with the
foregoing conditions. These policies and
procedures will require, among other
things, that the applicable Regulated
Entity Adviser will be notified of all
Potential Co-Investment Transactions
that fall within a Regulated Entity’s
then-current Objectives and Strategies
and will be given sufficient information
to make its independent determination
and recommendations under conditions
1, 2(a), 7 and 8.
15. If the Holders own in the aggregate
more than 25 percent of the Shares of
a Regulated Entity, then the Holders
will vote such Shares as directed by an
independent third party when voting on
(1) the election of directors; (2) the
removal of one or more directors; or (3)
all other matters under either the Act or
11 Applicants are not requesting and the staff is
not providing any relief for transaction fees
received in connection with any Co-Investment
Transaction.

compliance officer, as defined in Rule
38a–1(a)(4) under the 1940 Act, will
prepare an annual report for its Board
each year that evaluates (and documents
the basis of that evaluation) the
Regulated Entity’s compliance with the
terms and conditions of the application
and the procedures established to
achieve such compliance.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Miami
International Securities Exchange,
LLC; Notice of Filing and Immediate
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule
Change To Amend Its Fee Schedule
April 10, 2017.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’) 1 and Rule 19b–4
thereunder,2 notice is hereby given that
on April 6, 2017, Miami International
Securities Exchange LLC (‘‘MIAX
Options’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘‘Commission’’) a proposed rule change
as described in Items I, II, and III below,
which Items have been substantially
prepared by the Exchange. The
Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule
change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Terms of Substance of
the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange is filing a proposal to
amend the MIAX Options Fee Schedule
(the ‘‘Fee Schedule’’).
The Exchange initially filed the
proposal on March 29, 2017 (SR–MIAX–
2017–14). That filing was withdrawn
and replaced with the current filing
(SR–MIAX–2017–15).
The text of the proposed rule change
is available on the Exchange’s Web site
at http://www.miaxoptions.com/rulefilings, at MIAX’s principal office, and

at the Commission’s Public Reference
Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
In its filing with the Commission, the
Exchange included statements
concerning the purpose of and basis for
the proposed rule change and discussed
any comments it received on the
proposed rule change. The text of these
statements may be examined at the
places specified in Item IV below. The
Exchange has prepared summaries, set
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of
the most significant aspects of such
statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and the
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to amend its
Fee Schedule to permit Exchange
Market Makers 3 to appoint Electronic
Exchange Members 4 (‘‘EEMs’’), and vice
versa, as ‘‘Affiliates,’’ solely for
purposes of calculating transaction
volume in order to qualify for certain
transaction rebates and fee incentives
under the Fee Schedule. The Exchange
notes that this concept of appointment
between market makers and order flow
providers currently exists at a number of
other exchanges, including Bats BZX
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BATS’’), Bats EDGX
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘EDGX’’), Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Incorporated
(‘‘CBOE’’), NYSE Amex Options LLC
(‘‘Amex Options’’), and NASDAQ PHLX
LLC (‘‘PHLX’’), as more fully discussed
below.
In order for the Exchange to
implement this concept of appointment,
the Exchange proposes to amend the
definition of ‘‘Affiliate’’ contained in
Section (1)(a)(i), footnote 1, of the Fee
Schedule. Footnote 1 currently reads:
‘‘For purposes of the MIAX Options Fee
Schedule, the term ‘‘Affiliate’’ means an
affiliate of a Member of at least 75% common
ownership between the firms as reflected on
each firm’s Form BD, Schedule A
(‘‘Affiliate’’).’’
3 The term ‘‘Market Makers’’ refers to Lead Market
Makers (‘‘LMMs’’), Primary Lead Market Makers
(‘‘PLMMs’’), and Registered Market Makers
(‘‘RMMs’’) collectively. See Exchange Rule 100. A
Directed Order Lead Market Maker (‘‘DLMM’’) and
Directed Primary Lead Market Maker (‘‘DPLMM’’) is
a party to a transaction being allocated to the LMM
or PLMM and is the result of an order that has been
directed to the LMM or PLMM. See Footnote 2 to
the Fee Schedule.
4 The term ‘‘EEM’’ refers to the holder of a
Trading Permit who is not a Market Maker. See
Exchange Rule 100.

Applicants' Representations

    1. NB Crossroads is a Delaware limited liability corporation 
organized as a closed-end management investment company. NB 
Crossroads's investment objective is to provide attractive risk-
adjusted returns through diversified portfolio of professionally 
managed private equity funds and select direct investments in portfolio 
companies. The board of managers (``Board'') of NB Crossroads has six 
members, each of whom is not an ``interested person'' of NB Crossroads 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act (each is an 
``Independent Manager'').\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term ``Independent Manager'' refers to the independent 
managers, directors or trustees of any Regulated Entity (defined 
below).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Excelsior Private Markets II is a Delaware limited liability 
company organized as a closed-end management investment company. 
Excelsior Private Markets II seeks to provide attractive long-term 
returns to investors through investments in a diversified portfolio of 
professionally managed private equity funds and select direct 
investments in portfolio companies. The Board of Excelsior Private 
Markets II has six members, each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    3. Excelsior Private Markets III is a Delaware limited liability 
company organized as a closed-end management investment company. 
Excelsior Private Markets III seeks to provide attractive long-term 
returns to investors through investments in a diversified portfolio of

investments in portfolio companies. The Board of Excelsior Private 
Markets III has six members, each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    4. UST Global is a Delaware limited liability company organized as 
a closed-end management v company. UST Global seeks long-term capital 
appreciation by investing in a diversified group of private equity 
funds formed by a fund sponsor or sponsors experienced in making 
private equity investments. The Board of UST Global has six members, 
each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    5. Excelsior Venture III is a Delaware limited liability company

a lesser extent, domestic and international private funds, negotiated 
private investments in public companies and international direct 
investments. The Board of Excelsior Venture III has three members, each 
of whom is an Independent Manager.
    6. NBIA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered 
as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). NBIA serves as the 
investment adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBIA is an 
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman Group LLC 
(``Neuberger Berman'').
    7. NBAA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered 
as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Advisers Act. 
NBAA serves as the investment adviser to certain Existing Affiliated 
Funds and as the sub-adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBAA is 
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman.
    8. The Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on 
investing in a portfolio of professionally managed private equity funds 
and select direct investments in portfolio companies. Each Existing 
Affiliated Fund is advised by an Existing NB Adviser \2\ and would be 
an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ ``Existing NB Adviser'' means NBIA or NBAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. Applicants seek an order (``Order'') to permit a Regulated 
Entity \3\ and one or more other Regulated Entities and one or more 
Affiliated Funds \4\ to (a)

[[Page 18025]]

participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-
investment program where such participation would otherwise be 
prohibited under section 17 of the Act; and (b) make additional 
investments in securities of such issuers (``Follow-On Investments''), 
including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and 
other rights to purchase securities of the issuers. ``Co-Investment 
Transaction'' means any transaction in which a Regulated Entity (or its 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) participated 
together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or Affiliated 
Funds in reliance on the requested Order. ``Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction'' means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated 
Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries) could not 
participate together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or 
one or more Affiliated Funds without obtaining and relying on the 
Order.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Regulated Entity'' refers to any Existing Regulated Entity 
and any Future Regulated Entity. ``Future Regulated Entity'' means 
any closed-end management investment company formed in the future 
that is registered under the Act and is advised by a Regulated 
Entity Adviser and sub-advised by NBAA. ``Regulated Entity Adviser'' 
means (a) NBIA and (b) any future investment adviser that controls, 
is controlled by, or is under common control with NBIA and is 
registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
    \4\ ``Affiliated Fund'' means any Existing Affiliated Fund or 
any Future Affiliated Fund. ``Future Affiliated Fund'' means any 
investment fund that would be an ``investment company'' but for 
section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, is formed in the future, and 
is advised by an Adviser. The term ``Adviser'' means any Existing NB 
Adviser or any Regulated Entity Adviser. No Affiliated Fund is or 
will be a subsidiary of a Regulated Entity.
    \5\ All existing entities that currently intend to rely upon the 
requested Order have been named as applicants. Any other existing or 
future entity that subsequently relies on the Order will comply with 
the terms and conditions of the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. Applicants state that a Regulated Entity may, from time to 
time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries.\6\ Such a 
subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment 
Transaction with any other Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund because 
it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Entity for 
purposes of rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned 
Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment 
Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Entity and that the 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such 
transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent 
Regulated Entity were participating directly. Applicants represent that 
this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment 
Subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding 
vehicle for the Regulated Entity's investments and, therefore, no 
conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Entity and the 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated Entity's Board would 
make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in a Co-Investment 
Transaction, and the Regulated Entity's Board would be informed of, and 
take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment 
Subsidiary in the Regulated Entity's place. If the Regulated Entity 
proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any 
of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will also be 
informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of 
the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The term ``Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary'' means an 
entity: (a) That is wholly-owned by a Regulated Entity (with such 
Regulated Entity at all times holding, beneficially and of record, 
100% of the voting and economic interests); (b) whose sole business 
purpose is to hold one or more investments on behalf of such 
Regulated Entity; (c) with respect to which the board of directors 
of such Regulated Entity has the sole authority to make all 
determinations with respect to the entity's participation under the 
conditions of the application; and (d) that would be an investment 
company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. All 
subsidiaries participating in Co-Investment Transactions will be 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries and will have Objectives and 
Strategies (as defined below) that are either the same as, or a 
subset of, their parent Regulated Entity's Objectives and 
Strategies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any 
Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser will consider only the 
Objectives and Strategies,\7\ investment policies, investment 
positions, capital available for investment, and other pertinent 
factors applicable to that Regulated Entity. The Advisers expect that 
any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated 
Entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other 
Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain 
exceptions based on available capital or diversification.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The term ``Objectives and Strategies'' means a Regulated 
Entity's investment objectives and strategies as described in the 
Regulated Entity's registration statement on Form N-2, other filings 
the Regulated Entity has made with the Commission under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') or the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and the Regulated Entity's reports to 
shareholders.
    \8\ The Regulated Entities, however, will not be obligated to 
invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    12. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations 
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will present 
each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to 
the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that Co-Investment 
Transaction (the ``Eligible Directors'') \9\ and the majority of such 
managers of the Board who are Independent Managers (a ``Required 
Majority'') will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any 
investment by the participating Regulated Entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Eligible Directors may not have a financial interest in such 
transaction, plan, or arrangement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    13. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On 
Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Entity may 
participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other 
things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and 
each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its 
outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the 
disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the 
Board of the Regulated Entity has approved that Regulated Entity's 
participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity. If the Board does 
not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be 
submitted to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors. The Board of 
any Regulated Entity may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its 
approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the 
result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be 
submitted to the Eligible Directors.
    14. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will have a direct 
or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction (other 
than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated 
Entities), including any interest in any company whose securities would 
be acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction.
    15. Under condition 15, if an Adviser, its principals, or any 
person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the 
``Holders'') own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the 
outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the ``Shares''), then 
the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third 
party when voting on matters specified in the condition. Applicants 
believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Managers 
will act independently in evaluating the co-investment program, because 
the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the 
Independent Managers by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the 
Independent Managers can be removed will be limited significantly. 
Applicants represent that the Independent Managers will evaluate

[[Page 18026]]

and approve any such independent third party, taking into account its 
qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the Regulated 
Entity's shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
affiliated persons of a registered investment company from 
participating in joint transactions with the company unless the 
Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In 
passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers 
whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is 
consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and 
the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, 
the Regulated Entities may be, in some circumstances, limited in their 
ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment 
opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and 
conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are 
consistent with the protection of each Regulated Entity's shareholders 
and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 
Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Entities' participation in the 
Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, 
policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different 
from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following 
conditions:
    1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction for another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund that 
falls within a Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and 
Strategies, the Regulated Entity's Adviser will make an independent 
determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the 
Regulated Entity in light of the Regulated Entity's then-current 
circumstances.
    2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Entity's participation in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the 
Regulated Entity, the Adviser will then determine an appropriate level 
of investment for the Regulated Entity.
    (b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser 
to be invested by the applicable Regulated Entity in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested 
by the other participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds, 
collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the 
investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated 
among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for 
investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount 
proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide 
the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity with 
information concerning each participating party's available capital to 
assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated 
Entity's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
    (c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 
2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information 
concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the 
amount proposed to be invested by each Regulated Entity and each 
Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating 
Regulated Entity for their consideration. A Regulated Entity will co-
invest with another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund only if, 
prior to the Regulated Entity's participation in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
    (i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including 
the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated 
Entity and its investors and do not involve overreaching in respect of 
the Regulated Entity or its investors on the part of any person 
concerned;
    (ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
    (A) The interests of the Regulated Entity's investors; and
    (B) the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
    (iii) the investment by any other Regulated Entities or any 
Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Entity, and 
participation by the Regulated Entity would not be on a basis different 
from or less advantageous than that of any other Regulated Entities or 
any Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Entity or 
any Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity itself, gains the 
right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's 
board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar 
right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio 
company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required 
Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition 
(2)(c)(iii), if:
    (A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the 
selection of such director or board observer, if any; and
    (B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic 
reports to the Board of the Regulated Entity with respect to the 
actions of such director or the information received by such board 
observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to 
participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; 
and
    (C) any fees or other compensation that any Regulated Entity or any 
Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any Regulated Entity or any 
Affiliated Fund receives in connection with the right of a Regulated 
Entity or an Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board 
observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of 
the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the 
participating Affiliated Funds (who may each, in turn, share its 
portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated 
Entities in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
    (iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Entity will not 
benefit any Adviser, the other Regulated Entities, the Affiliated Funds 
or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the 
Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by 
condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) of the Act, 
as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the 
securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment 
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described 
in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
    3. Each Regulated Entity has the right to decline to participate in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the 
amount proposed.
    4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each 
Regulated Entity, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated 
Entities or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell 
within the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies 
that were not made available to the Regulated Entity, and an 
explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the 
Regulated Entity. All information presented to the Board pursuant to 
this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Entity and at 
least two years thereafter, and will be

[[Page 18027]]

subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
    5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with 
condition 8,\10\ a Regulated Entity will not invest in reliance on the 
Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Entity, Affiliated Fund, 
or any affiliated person of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund 
is an existing investor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a 
Regulated Entity in issuers in which that Regulated Entity already 
holds investments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. A Regulated Entity will not participate in any Potential Co-
Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of 
securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights 
will be the same for each participating Regulated Entity and Affiliated 
Fund. The grant to another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund, but 
not the Regulated Entity, of the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have 
an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate 
in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be 
interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 
2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
    7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund elects to 
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that 
was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser 
will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each 
Regulated Entity in the disposition.
    (b) Each Regulated Entity will have the right to participate in 
such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the 
same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating 
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds.
    (c) A Regulated Entity may participate in such disposition without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed 
participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such 
disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the 
issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the 
Regulated Entity the ability to participate in such dispositions on a 
pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and 
(iii) the Board of the Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly 
basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this 
condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written 
recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the 
Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will 
participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required 
Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best 
interests.
    (d) Each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund will bear its 
own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
    8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund desires to make 
a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, 
including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each 
Regulated Entity.
    (b) A Regulated Entity may participate in such Follow-On Investment 
without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The 
proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated 
Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments 
in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) 
the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best 
interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in Follow-
On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in 
the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its 
written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to 
the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in 
such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority 
determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.
    (c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
    (i) The amount of a Follow-On Investment is not based on the 
Regulated Entities' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments 
immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
    (ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested 
by each Regulated Entity in the Follow-On Investment, together with the 
amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in 
the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the 
amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro 
rata based on each party's capital available for investment in the 
asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested 
by each.
    (d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this 
condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all 
purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the 
application.
    9. The Independent Managers of each Regulated Entity will be 
provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-
Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including 
investments made by other Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds 
that the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, so 
that the Independent Managers may determine whether all investments 
made during the preceding quarter, including those investments which 
the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, comply 
with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Managers 
will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the 
Regulated Entity of participating in new and existing Co-Investment 
Transactions.
    10. Each Regulated Entity will maintain the records required by 
section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Entities were a 
business development company (as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the 
Act) and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were 
approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
    11. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will also be a 
director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise 
an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
    12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or 
disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction 
(including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any 
such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to 
the extent not payable by an Adviser under the investment advisory 
agreements with the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be 
shared by the Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Entities in proportion 
to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or 
disposed of, as the case may be.

[[Page 18028]]

    13. Any transaction fee \11\ (including break-up or commitment fees 
but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) of the Act, 
as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction 
will be distributed to the participating Regulated Entities and 
Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested 
or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If 
any transaction fee is to be held by the Adviser pending consummation 
of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account 
maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications 
prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a 
competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among 
the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds based on the 
amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the 
Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Entities or any 
affiliated person of the Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds will 
receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result 
of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in 
the case of the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, the pro 
rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation 
described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of the 
Advisers, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the 
agreements between the Advisers and the Regulated Entities or the 
Affiliated Funds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Applicants are not requesting and the staff is not 
providing any relief for transaction fees received in connection 
with any Co-Investment Transaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14. The Advisers will each maintain policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the foregoing conditions. 
These policies and procedures will require, among other things, that 
the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will be notified of all 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within a Regulated 
Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies and will be given 
sufficient information to make its independent determination and 
recommendations under conditions 1, 2(a), 7 and 8.
    15. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the 
Shares of a Regulated Entity, then the Holders will vote such Shares as 
directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election 
of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) all 
other matters under either the Act or applicable State law affecting 
the Board's composition, size or manner of election.
    16. Each Regulated Entity's chief compliance officer, as defined in 
Rule 38a-1(a)(4) under the 1940 Act, will prepare an annual report for 
its Board each year that evaluates (and documents the basis of that 
evaluation) the Regulated Entity's compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve 
such compliance.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

	Exhibit 99(a)





	CONSOLIDATED AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER





	EXCELSIOR VENTURE PARTNERS III, LLC






	EXCELSIOR VENTURE INVESTORS III, LLC





	June 3, 2003




	This consolidated charter sets forth the purpose, authority and responsibilities of the Audit Committees of the
	Boards of Directors of Excelsior Private Equity Fund II, Inc., (Fund II) and the Boards of Managers of Excelsior Venture Partners III, LLC (Partners III) and Excelsior Venture Investors III, LLC (Investors III)
	(the Board in this Charter shall be understood to refer to each Board acting separately and references to the Company shall be understood to refer to each of Fund II, Partners III and Investors III, each of which is adopting this
	consolidated charter).





	Purposes





	The
	Audit Committee of each Board (the Committee, which term refers to each Committee separately) has, as its primary purpose, oversight responsibility with respect to: (a) the adequacy of the Companys accounting and financial
	reporting processes, policies and practices; (b) the integrity of the Companys financial statements and the independent audit thereof; (c) the adequacy of the Companys overall system of internal controls and, as appropriate,
	the internal controls of certain service providers; (d) the Companys compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements; (e) determining the qualification and independence of the Companys independent auditors; and
	(f) the Companys internal audit function.





	Authority





	The Committee has been duly established by the Board and shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the authority to retain counsel and other experts or consultants
	at the expense of the Company. The Committee has the authority and responsibility to retain and terminate the Companys independent auditors. In connection therewith, the Committee must evaluate the independence of the Companys
	independent auditors and receive the auditors specific representations as to their independence.





	Composition and Term of Committee Members





	The Committee shall be comprised of the Directors or Managers who are Independent Directors or Managers, which term shall mean
	each Director or Manager (i) who is not an interested person, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, of the Company; and (ii) who has not accepted directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other
	compensatory fee from the Company (other than fees for serving as a Director or Manager or member of such Companys Audit Committee). The members of the Committee shall designate one member to serve as Chairman of the Committee, with
	Mr. Gene M. Bernstein serving as the initial Chairman of the Committee.




	Each member of the Committee shall serve until a
	successor is appointed.




	The Board shall determine whether: (i) the Committee has at least one member who is an audit committee
	financial expert, (ACFE) as such term is defined in the rules adopted under Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The designation of a person as an ACFE is not intended to impose any greater responsibility or
	liability on that person than the responsibility and liability imposed on such person as a member of the Committee, nor does it decrease the duties and obligations of other Committee members or the Board.




	 




	47








	Meetings





	The Committee shall meet on a regular basis and no less frequently than semi-annually. Periodically, the Committee shall meet to discuss with management the annual audited financial statements and quarterly or semi-annual financial
	statements. Periodically, the Committee should meet separately with management, the Companys administrator and independent auditors to discuss any matters that the Committee or any of these persons or firms believes should be discussed
	privately. The Committee may request any officer or employee of the Companys investment adviser or the Companys legal counsel (or counsel to the Independent Directors or Managers of the Board) or independent auditors to attend a meeting
	of the Committee or to meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Committee.




	Minutes of each meeting will be taken and circulated to
	all members of the Committee in a timely manner.




	Any action of the Committee requires the vote of a majority of the Committee members
	present, whether in person or otherwise, at the meeting at which such action is considered. At any meeting of the Committee, one member of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking any action.

	CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS






	FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS






	OUR VISION





	Provide
	shareholders with the most useful and ethical funds in the nation.





	OUR VALUES





	Be fair, empathetic and responsive in serving our shareholders.




	Strive relentlessly to innovate what we do and how we do it.




	Always earn and be worthy of our
	shareholders trust.





	SHAREHOLDER VALUE





	Excelsior Funds Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officer and any other officers who serve a similar function shall endeavor to act in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.





	Introduction





	The Excelsior Funds Code
	of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) covers all of the Funds. This Code applies to the Funds Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officer and any other officers who serve a similar function (each an
	Officer).




	The Funds are committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct in the fulfillment of our Vision and Values. We
	are proud of our long-standing reputation for integrity and honesty that strengthens our Vision to provide our shareholders with the most useful and ethical funds in the world. This reputation is not just a source of competitive advantage in the
	financial services industry; it is fundamental to the way we do business.




	This Code provides guidance on how you, as an Officer, uphold
	these ethical standards. It applies to your service to the Excelsior Funds.




	The Code consists of an outline of policies regarding conduct
	in several key areas: ethical behavior and legal compliance, conflicts of interest, confidentiality and business practices. You are responsible for reviewing the Code and for acting in compliance with the Code in your daily activities.




	The Code is not exhaustive; it provides guidance for carrying out your responsibilities on behalf of the Funds and observing the highest standards of
	ethical conduct. Because the Code does not address every possible situation that may arise, you are responsible for exercising good judgment, applying ethical principles, and raising questions when in doubt. Your integrity and good judgment enhance
	the Funds brand, build the Funds reputation, and are the foundation of trust for our shareholder and business relationships.




	 




	50







	The Code also requires that Officers adhere to the specific information and guidance that is provided in
	US Trust (US Trust) company-wide policies and procedures, including the U.S. Trust Compliance Manual and the Investment Adviser Code of Ethics; policies and procedures for individual business and support units; publications that address
	individual conduct; and documents to which you agree as a requirement of your employment, collectively referred to as company policies. Company policies may be published in paper or electronic media.




	You are responsible for reviewing the Code including company policies applicable to you, and for acting in compliance with the Code in your daily
	activities. You may obtain company policies and forms from the US Trust internal web site or the Chief Compliance Officer of the Fund.





	General
	Excelsior Funds and Personal Standards of Conduct





	As an Officer you have a responsibility to act in a manner in which you earn the
	publics trust and confidence. Your conduct is guided by our values, which are to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Be fair, empathetic and responsive in serving our shareholders.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Strive relentlessly to innovate what we do and how we do it.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Always earn and be worthy of our shareholders trust.








	Excelsior Funds Conduct





	The following general principles guide our Excelsior Funds conduct:



	 





	 




	




	 





	We will act in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and will not tolerate behavior that is otherwise.






	 





	 




	




	 





	We will make public disclosures as required by law and regulation and as deemed appropriate to enable reasonable evaluation of the Excelsior Funds.






	 





	 




	




	 





	We will strive to provide an equitable return for our investors.






	 





	 




	




	 





	We will provide products and services designed to help shareholders achieve their financial goals.






	 





	 




	




	 





	We will conduct business fairly, in open competition.








	Individual Conduct





	The following general principles guide your individual conduct:



	 





	 




	




	 





	You will not take any action that will violate any applicable law or regulation.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will maintain the confidentiality of all information you obtain in the course of your employment.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will escalate issues which you reasonably believe may place the Funds at risk, and report any behavior you reasonably believe is wrong.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will not abuse or take the Funds assets or use them for your personal gain.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will not engage in any activities that create a conflict of interest between you and the Funds.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will comport yourself publicly in a manner that does not bring discredit on the Funds.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will deal fairly with shareholders, colleagues and others.






	 





	 




	




	 





	You will comply with this Code.







	 




	51







	You have personal responsibility to conduct the Funds business in a manner consistent with these
	principles, and you cannot avoid this responsibility by contrary instructions from a supervisor or by turning a blind eye. Many of these principles are explained in more detail below and in the Funds other polices and procedures. If you have
	questions on any of them, you should consult with the Chief Legal Officer of the Funds or the Chief Compliance Officer of the Fund.





	Ethical Behavior





	Your decisions and behavior have far-reaching implications. Standards of ethical and professional conduct reflect on the individual, on
	the Excelsior Funds brand, and on the investment industry as a whole. A strong personal sense of ethics should always play a significant role in guiding you towards a proper course of action.





	Escalation of Concerns





	Guidance is provided
	throughout the Code on the appropriate means for escalating, disclosing and seeking approvals for activities governed by the Code. At a minimum, if you know of, or reasonably believe there is, a violation of applicable laws or this Code, you must
	report that information immediately to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer. Neither you nor the person to whom you make a report should conduct preliminary investigations, unless authorized to do so by the Chief Legal Officer or
	the Chief Compliance Officer. Anyone who in good faith raises an issue in accordance with this Code regarding a possible violation of law, regulation or company policy or any suspected illegal or unethical behavior will be protected from
	retaliation.





	Compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Policies





	The foundation of the Funds ethical standards is compliance with the letter and spirit of the law. You must respect and obey all of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business, including among
	others, securities and other federal, state and local laws. You are responsible for being familiar and complying with the Funds policies and procedures. Although you are not expected to know the details of each law governing our business, you
	are expected to be familiar with and comply with the Funds policies and procedures and, when in doubt, to seek advice from the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer as outlined in this Code.





	Conflicts of Interest





	To maintain the highest
	ethical standards in conducting our business, it is important that you do not place yourself in a position that would cloud your judgment in carrying out the business affairs of the Funds. A conflict of interest occurs when your private
	interest interferes in any wayor even appears to interferewith the interests of the Funds. You have a duty to report any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to be or to create a conflict of interest
	with the Funds. If you have any questions regarding what might constitute a conflict of interest, or to report any transaction or relationship that you believe has occurred or may occur that might constitute a conflict of interest, contact the Chief
	Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer.




	Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Officers and the Funds
	and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act). For example, Officers may not
	individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Funds because of their status as affiliated persons of the Funds. The Funds and USTs compliance programs and
	procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.




	 




	52







	Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or
	as a result of, the contractual relationship between the Funds and UST. Each Officer may also be an officer or employee of UST or its affiliates. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
	formally for the Funds or for UST, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on UST and the Funds. The participation of the Officers in such activities is inherent in the
	contractual relationship between the Funds and UST and is consistent with the performance by the Officers of their duties as officers of the Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment
	Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Directors/Trustees/Managers that the Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by
	this or other codes.





	Outside Directorships, Outside Employment and Other Outside Activities





	Your position with the Funds and UST must be your primary business association and must take precedence over any other employment or business affiliation
	you may have. We encourage you to accept appropriate directorships and advisory positions at most non-profit organizations and commercial firms; however, your service as an adviser to, or member of, the Board of a public company, non-profit
	charitable, civic, social service, religious, professional or trade organization must be consistent with the provisions for the Code, and not create a conflict of interest with your responsibilities to the Funds. This includes outside positions and
	activities that may be misconstrued to be activities of the Funds. Unless you have obtained prior approval from the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer, you may not hold any position, whether paid or unpaid, with any other
	organization or outside activity that may interfere with your duties and responsibilities at the Funds. Approval will only be granted where it is clear that the proposed activity will not interfere with your duties at the Funds or UST and that
	neither the Funds nor UST will incur any liability or responsibility for such outside activity.




	Conflicts of interest may arise in certain
	business situations in which you, or a member of your household (or of a relative whose financial interests you control), participate. Examples include making significant investments in companies that compete with the Funds or in entities that do
	business with the Funds. If you or a member of your household intends to hold such an investment, you must disclose it in writing to, and obtain prior approval for the investment from

	the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer.






	Personal Investment Accounts and Inside Information





	You must disclose any investment accounts maintained by you or any related parties. You must do this at the time you become an Officer, at the time of any change in such information, and annually thereafter. Unless an
	investment qualifies for an exemption, new employees are required to transfer all investment accounts to a US Trust corporate affiliated bank or Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. within 90 days of employment. Officers may not buy, sell, trade or
	carry securities or commodities for their personal investment accounts under circumstances that could result in their becoming obligated to any dealer, broker or client or that could produce or appear to produce conflicts of interest.




	You should avoid circumstances that could introduce a personal financial bias into the handling of shareholder and Fund matters. In this regard, you
	should not become over-indebted and should borrow only from banks and other traditional lenders. You may not borrow from clients of U.S. Trust without full disclosure to, and prior written approval from, the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance
	Officer. Employees may not borrow from a vendor of U.S. Trust, unless that vendor is a bank or traditional lender, and then only through such vendors public lending process.




	A corporate opportunity is an opportunity discovered through the use of Fund property, information or position. Officers are prohibited from
	taking corporate opportunities for themselves personally. This rule includes any fee or other compensation offered or paid by Fund Shareholders in connection with routine company activity or for individual service as an executor, trustee, director
	or other fiduciary. It covers any other




	 




	53







	services performed for your benefit because of your role at the Funds, such as endorsements, lectures, articles, book reviews, compensation received from
	vendors and compensation paid for participating in interviews with the media and making radio or television appearances. You may not use Fund property, information or position for improper personal gain, and you may not compete with the Fund
	directly or indirectly.





	Acceptance of Gifts or Entertainment





	The acceptance of gifts or excessive entertainment from shareholders, vendors, suppliers, competitors or other employees must not constitute a conflict of interest or create the appearance of impropriety. You may
	accept small gifts and entertainment that are worth less than the amount UST policy sets as a limit, but you must be personally satisfied that the gift or entertainment is not intended to influence your judgment or the performance of your duties. If
	you have any questions regarding the appropriateness of a gift, you must obtain approval from the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer before accepting it.





	Confidentiality of Information





	As investment companies, we have particular responsibilities for
	safeguarding the information of our shareholders and the proprietary information of the Funds. You should be mindful of this obligation when you use the telephone, fax, telex, electronic mail, and other electronic means of storing and transmitting
	information. You should not discuss confidential information in public areas where it can be overheard, read confidential documents in public places, nor leave or discard confidential documents where they can be retrieved by others.





	Confidentiality of Shareholder Information





	Information concerning the identity of the Funds underlying shareholders and their transactions and accounts is confidential. Such information may not be disclosed to persons working on behalf of the Funds except as they may need to
	know it in order to fulfill their responsibilities to the Funds. You may not disclose such information to anyone or any firm outside the Funds unless (i) the outside firm needs to know the information in order to perform services for the Funds
	and is bound to maintain its confidentiality; (ii) when the shareholder has consented or been given an opportunity to request that the information not be shared; (iii) as required by law; or (iv) as authorized by the Chief Legal
	Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer.




	Information regarding shareholder or Funds transactions must not be used in any way to influence
	trades in personal accounts. Trading ahead of Funds transactions is known as frontrunning and is prohibited. Following Funds transactions with your trading activity is known as piggybacking or shadowing and is likewise prohibited. If you reasonably
	believe improper trading in personal or Funds accounts has occurred, you must report such conduct to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer.





	Privacy





	Excelsior Funds are committed to safeguarding customers privacy. We do not sell any personally identifiable
	customer information. Sharing of such information with third parties is limited to situations related to the processing and servicing of customer accounts, and to specifically delineated exceptions in the federal privacy law. We share information
	with our affiliates as allowed by federal law. You must be familiar with the procedural and systemic safeguards we maintain to protect this information and report any breaches of these safeguards to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance
	Officer.





	Proprietary Information of the Funds





	You have the responsibility to safeguard the Funds proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property (copyrights, trademarks or patents or trade secrets), particular know-how (business or organizational
	designs, or business, marketing or service plans or ideas) and sensitive information about the




	 




	54







	Funds (databases, records, salary information or unpublished financial reports). If you have any questions about what constitutes proprietary information, or
	if you believe such information has been compromised, contact the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer.





	Protection and Use of the
	Funds Assets





	You are obligated to protect the Funds assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste
	have a direct impact on the Funds. The Funds equipment should not be used for non-Funds business, though incidental personal use may be permitted. The Funds or UST have the right to examine your use of this property, including the contents of
	the desktop and/or laptop computer assigned to you, your use of all communications devices (telephones, voicemail, pages, fax machines, e-mail, on-line services) and any furniture or filing facilities used by you. You should have no expectation of
	privacy or confidentiality regarding your activities while on the premises of, or when using the facilities or systems of, the Funds or UST even though you may use security features such as personal passwords. Breaches of this obligation must be
	reported to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer.





	Non-Retaliation





	It is your obligation to report issues regarding possible violations of business regulations or this Code when you suspect in good faith that a violation
	may have or might occur. No Officer will be retaliated against for making a good faith complaint or bringing inappropriate conduct to the Funds attention, for assisting another Officer in making a good faith report, for cooperating in an
	investigation, or for filing an administrative claim with a state or federal governmental agency. Any employee who engages in retaliatory conduct in violation of our policies will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
	employment. If you reasonably believe retaliatory conduct has occurred, you must report such conduct to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer.





	Business Practices





	It is your obligation to report issues regarding possible violations of business regulations or this
	Code when you suspect in good faith that a violation may have or might occur. As a financial institution, it is imperative that we operate with efficiency, with the highest business standards, and that we maintain and provide accurate information.





	Financial Disclosures





	The Funds are
	committed to providing full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies and in other public
	communications made by the Funds. You are required to comply with Funds policies and procedures to provide such full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure. If you have any questions about your duties in supporting the Funds
	financial reporting processes, contact the Chief Legal Officer.





	Conduct of Audits





	Neither you nor any other person acting under your direction shall directly or indirectly take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate,
	or mislead any independent public or certified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the Funds financial statements.




	Types of conduct that constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including offering future employment or contracts for non-audit services;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Providing an auditor with inaccurate or misleading legal analysis;







	 




	55









	 




	




	 





	Threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the auditor objects to the issuers accounting;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner objects to the Funds accounting;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Blackmailing; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	Making physical threats.







	If you
	reasonably believe improper influence has occurred, you must report such conduct to the Chief Legal Officer.





	Record-Keeping





	We require honest and accurate recording and reporting of information to maintain the integrity of our business records and to make responsible business
	decisions. The Funds books, records and accounts must (i) accurately reflect all transactions of the Funds and all other events that are subject of a specific regulatory record-keeping requirement; (ii) be maintained in reasonable
	detail; and (iii) conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Funds system of internal controls. Unrecorded or off the books funds or assets are prohibited unless permitted by applicable law or regulation.
	Business records must not contain exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memoranda, formal reports, and all other forms of business records.
	You must be familiar with the Funds record retention policies and always retain or destroy records according to them. In the event of litigation, governmental investigation or the threat of such action, you should consult the Chief Legal
	Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer regarding record retention.




	Any suspected breach of this obligation should be reported immediately
	to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer and, if you are an employee, to your supervisor.





	Cooperating with Compliance, Audit,
	Regulatory Authorities and Authorized Investigations





	You must cooperate fully with compliance officers, auditors, examiners and
	regulatory authorities, and others who are conducting authorized examinations, investigations or other reviews of the Funds records and business practices. Authorized requests for information and access to the Funds records are to be
	satisfied in a timely, responsive and respectful manner.




	Any Officer who has been convicted of any crime involving dishonesty or a breach
	of trust must disclose such conviction to U.S. Trust Human Resources promptly, even if that crime did not relate to Fund business. Officers are also required to provide disclosures in accordance with the U.S. Trust Due Diligence questionnaire for
	New Employees and Annual Review Process.




	If you have any questions related to the appropriateness of providing access to the Funds
	records, you should contact the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer. In the event of litigation or governmental investigation, you should consult the Chief Legal Officer regarding document production and record retention.





	Competition and Fair Dealing





	We operate our
	business fairly and honestly. We seek competitive advantage through performance and dedication to our Vision and Values and never through unethical or illegal business practices. It is our policy to comply with anti-trust laws. These laws are
	complex and not easily summarized but at a minimum require that there be no agreement or understanding between the Funds and their competitors that affect prices, terms or conditions of sale or that unreasonably restrain full and fair competition.
	You must always respect the rights of




	 




	56







	and deal fairly with the Funds shareholders and competitors. You must never take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of
	privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice. If you have any question about what constitutes an unfair business practice, you should consult the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance
	Officer.





	Copyright Law, the Internet and Software





	You must comply with the terms of all software licenses, use agreements for Internet site access, downloading provisions and all other state and federal laws governing all forms of intellectual property that you may
	encounter on the Internet.




	You may not copy software provided by the Funds or use it on a computer other than the one provided to you
	unless the license agreement permits such copying or use. Any authorized copies must contain the proper copyright and other required notices of the vendor. If you wish to use any software not provided by the Funds or UST, you must first obtain
	permission from the Computer Services Division of U.S. Trust Corporation and have the software tested by the Computer Services Division to assure application integrity and software compatibility with our systems environment.





	Vendor Selection, Brokerage Allocation





	The selection
	of professional services, including those of brokers, dealers, attorneys or business consultants, should be based on competitive analysis of quality, price and benefit to the Funds. When transacting business on behalf of the Funds, if you feel that
	you may have a potential conflict of interest, you must notify the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer of the potential conflict prior to initiating the transaction.




	If you are in a position to influence the selection of brokers, you are prohibited from having any financial interest in a brokerage firm (other than
	those whose shares are traded publicly) and you may not accept gifts or entertainment or any other form of compensation from the brokerage community except as permitted under this Code.





	Prohibition of Bribery and Kickbacks





	Our policies prohibit bribery or kickbacks of any kind and to
	anyone in the conduct of our business. The U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations applicable specifically to business gratuities that may be accepted by U.S. and foreign government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an
	official or employee of the U.S. government or an official, employee or candidate of a foreign government of a gift, favor, payment or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Excelsior Funds policy but could also be a
	criminal offense. Similarly, federal law, as well as the laws of many states, prohibits engaging in commercial bribery. Commercial bribery involves soliciting, demanding or agreeing to accept anything of value from any person intending
	to influence or be rewarded in connection with any business or transaction, and prohibits all such behavior, for example, with respect to vendors, competitors, shareholders, and government employees. If you have any questions or need any guidance,
	you should contact the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer.





	Compliance Procedures





	We will work together to ensure compliance with the Code and to take prompt action in response to reported violations of the Code.





	Seeking Guidance





	If you are unsure of what to do in
	any situation, seek guidance before you act. Use the Funds resources, including the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer. Remember that you must report all incidents of misconduct, and you may do so without fear of retaliation.
	If you have violated the Code, however, making a report will not protect you from the consequences of your actions.




	 




	57








	Reporting Conduct that May be in Violation of the Code





	You must report conduct that you believe to be in violation of the Code, Excelsior Funds policy, law or regulation. Reports should be escalated in
	the following manner:



	 





	 




	




	 





	If you have a reasonable belief that a violation has occurred, or may occur, you must report the conduct to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance
	Officer.






	 





	 




	




	 





	The Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential violation reported to them and will notify
	counsel for the Funds independent Directors/Trustees/Managers (Directors/Trustees/Managers) and counsel for the Funds of the substance of the potential violation.






	 





	 




	




	 





	If after investigation, the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer reasonably believes that no violation has occurred, they are not required to take
	any further action.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Any matter that the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be reported to the Directors/Trustees/Managers.






	 





	 




	




	 





	If the Directors/Trustees/Managers concur that a violation has occurred, the Directors/Trustees/Managers will consider appropriate action, which may include review
	of, and appropriate modification to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of US Trust or its board; notification to appropriate personnel of the U.S. Trust Corporation or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss
	the Officer.








	Roles in Observing Compliance





	As an Officer of the Funds, you have a role in observing compliance with the Code. In general, that includes:





	Role of Officers




	 





	 




	




	 





	Read and be familiar with conduct rules outlined in this Code and periodically review them.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Affirm in writing to the Directors/Trustees/Managers that the Officer has received, read and understands the Code.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Annually affirm to the Directors/Trustees/Managers that the Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Comply with the conduct standards outlined in this Code in all dealings and actions, including those with shareholders, the public and vendors.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Report in a timely manner to the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer any conduct that may constitute a violation of the Code, Excelsior Funds
	policies, or laws, rules and regulations.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Raise questions or concerns about conduct issues with your supervisor, the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer, and seek advice when in doubt.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Cooperate with management during fact-finding investigations and comply with any confidentiality rules imposed.








	Role of Directors/Trustees/Managers




	 





	 




	




	 





	Review the Code annually and recommend any changes.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Review the Officer reports of compliance with the Code.








	Interpretation of Code and Waivers of the Code





	The Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer are responsible for
	applying the Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under it and have the authority to interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, waivers of the Code may be made only by the Directors/Trustees/Managers and will be
	promptly disclosed publicly as required by law.




	 




	58








	Amendments





	This Code may not be amended except in written form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority of the Directors/Trustees/Managers including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees/Managers, except for an amendment to
	Exhibit A, which is attached hereto. Any amendments will, to the extent required, be disclosed in accordance with law.





	Other Policies and Procedures





	This Code constitutes the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
	and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the Funds, UST, U.S. Trust Corporation or other Excelsior Funds service providers govern or purport to govern the
	behavior or activities of an Officer who is subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they conflict with the provisions of this Code. USTs and the Funds code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 pursuant to the
	Investment Company Act and USTs and US Trust Corporations policies and procedures set forth in their respective compliance manuals and elsewhere are separate requirements applying to the Officers and are not part of this Code.





	Confidentiality





	All reports and
	records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
	Directors/Trustees/Managers, U.S. Trust Corporation and their respective counsel.





	Internal Use





	This Code is intended for internal use by the Funds and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Funds, as to any fact, circumstance, or
	legal conclusion.





	Contacts





	If you
	have further questions about the Code, or about its applicability with respect to a particular matter, please contact the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer. The Chief Legal Officers and Chief Compliance Officers contact
	information are attached hereto as Exhibit A.
