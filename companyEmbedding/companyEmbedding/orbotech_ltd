Orbotech: A Great Company Positioned For Emerging Technologies - Orbotech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ORBK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Orbotech: A Great Company Positioned For Emerging TechnologiesApr.13.17 | About: Orbotech Ltd. (ORBK) Integer Investments Long/short equity, value, special situations, growth at reasonable priceInteger InvestmentsSummaryOrbotech supplies manufacturing products and solutions to consumer electronics manufacturers such as Samsung and Foxconn.The consumer electronics industry continues to boom, and emerging economies like China and India are likely to cause this trend to continue.The company’s strong positioning in the rapid-growth industries of solar energy and autonomous vehicles should be watched closely. This post is written by Callum Lo for Integer Investments. Introduction Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) is one of the world's largest suppliers of manufacturing solutions to electronics manufacturers. It provides machinery and process solutions to manufacturers that create consumer electronics, computing products, solar cells and more. The company describes itself as being a supplier of "yield-enhancing and process enabling solutions." Essentially this means that it engineers better processes and equipment for companies like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF) to produce products like flat-screen TVs and computers. Its emphasis is on improving the efficiency of production and eliminating defects in products through vigorous testing and high-quality manufacturing methods.  Industry Outlook The consumer electronics industry is the main area to which Orbotech supplies. This includes mainstream products that all retail consumers are familiar with, such as smartphones, tablets, monitors, flat-screen TVs and wearables. Demand for these kinds of products is uniformly expected to continue rising, as it has for the past decades. Orbotech supplies to all the major manufacturers of these kinds of products, and even claims on its website that "virtually every electronic device in the world is produced using Orbotech systems." Research undertaken by Credence Research found that the global consumer electronics industry as a whole is set to grow by 5% per year until 2023 compounded annually. This equates to aggregate compounded growth of 40% over that time period. Orbotech equipment is used for all major consumer electronics products like flat-screen TVs: 

 A number of factors are cited in the report as pointing to such impressive and persistent growth over the next seven years. To begin with, a number of governments in the developing world are implementing sophisticated and wide-scale digital initiatives to upgrade their economies and provide digital products to large swathes of their populations. Nations with strong central government control such as China, India and Brazil are leading this charge, with those three nations alone representing nearly 3 billion people or over 40% of the entire human population. A focus on smartphones, tablets and laptops within these programs is benefiting Orbotech and its competitors, as all of these products feature manufacturing solutions they produce. Nations such as these also are naturally experiencing increased demand for consumer electronics without the help of government intervention. This is because of the ballooning urban population and rising middle-class incomes as a result of incredible growth and development in the past 30 years. Asia in particular continues to experience a boom in demand for consumer electronics that are commonplace in Western nations. Orbotech produces semiconductors: 

 Conversely, the report notes several factors that may hinder growth in this industry. Wearable devices and other new innovations still have high price tags, and are seen more as luxuries than items within the reach of the vast majority of consumers. This means that demand is likely to be dampened to some extent, particularly in poorer nations. Moreover, the report highlights several data privacy and security concerns which may make consumers reluctant to fully embrace new technologies such as the "Internet of Things" within homes. These caveats are small, however, and the broad outlook is extremely positive for consumer electronics. Moreover, competition continues to increase and become more aggressive among manufacturers and retailers, which serves to benefit Orbotech as its potential customer base expands. Financial Outlook Orbotech had a solid financial year in 2016 in terms of total sales, with revenue rising from $753 million in 2015 to $806 million, an increase of 7%. The company also has a sizeable amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand compared to its total amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, total cash, cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and marketable securities were valued at a total of $236.6 million. This amounts to nearly three times as much as the total debt the firm currently owes, which sat at $88.4 million at the end of the year. The reporting for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a mixed bag, with earnings that many considered to be disappointing. At the same time, the gross margin rose to 46.8% and the CEO communicated the company's optimism for the future, highlighting increased electronic content in smartphones and automobiles as reasons. At the time of November 2016, a number of analysts have argued that the company's shares presently trade at a discount when compared to other similar companies in the same industry. This is despite fairly strong growth and profitability forecasts and steps being taken by the firm to diversify its business interests in order to mitigate the cyclical nature of the industry it operates in. The share price sat at a low of $27.07 at the beginning of November 2016, before rising substantially to reach $36.59 at the end of January. Since that time, it has fallen somewhat, and currently trades at around $30.64. This indicates that the company's promising prospects may have now been priced in by the market, and that it no longer trades at a discount. However, should the stock price continue its current trend of steadily decreasing without any change in the fundamental outlook for the industry and company, investors should consider looking into a long position on the stock. Analysis In the past, Orbotech has successfully outgrown the market in which it operates, indicating that it has found innovative ways to reduce costs and boost demand above and beyond the systemic forces that benefit them through the rise of consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Orbotech had a very successful period for one of its key products - the printed circuit board. A printed circuit board is a simple but very useful innovation in the field of electronics, which saves the need to have a large amount of complex wiring going point-to-point in a laborious way that often led to failures. The printed circuit board by contrast is a small substrate board with various different lines and pads on it. These allow electrical signals to move easily between components using solder, which conducts energy and adheres to the board. A printed circuit board: 

 According to Orbotech CEO Asher Levy during the company's Q4 2016 earnings call:  "The printed circuit board division continued to perform well during the fourth quarter. Overall our product sales for the PCB division grew by more than 20%, despite overall decline in industry growth. This achievement is primarily the result of excellent execution of the division strategy, combining the launch of new solutions with the new manufacturing technologies, while maintaining our leadership in existing category, which is positive growth by the introduction of new products launched during the first half of 2016 which had become a significant driver of our growth trajectory in this division."  

 (Source: Company presentation) This indicates that the firm may also be able to weather a decline in demand for consumer electronics, provided it continues to innovate with new manufacturing solutions and better processes. Given the instability of nations like China which are currently driving the growth in the consumer electronics market, this is an important factor to be aware of. Moreover, consumer electronics for a number of products, such as smartphones, may reach saturation point in developed economies, and experience a rapid drop off in demand as a result. So far, companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been able to avoid this downside by constantly coming out with improved products and better features. As this becomes more and more difficult to do at such a rapid pace, market saturation may present a risk to companies like Orbotech. That being said, electronics companies like Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Samsung continue to constantly innovate in their products to the benefit of companies like Orbotech. For example, the company is certain to gain from the transition to higher-definition TV screens and flexible flat screens, as the manufacturing processes involved in their production become more complex. Solar Industry And Autonomous Vehicles Orbotech invests in solar technologies through its subsidiary, Orbotech LT Solar, LLC. We recently wrote about the prospects of the solar industry in light of global competition and government incentives policies. In that post, about Orion Energy Systems (NYSEMKT:OESX), we argued that exiting from the solar industry was a shrewd move:    "The solar market has been noted for its ever-increasing competition over the last few years, as the technology reaches a critical point of viability and affordability. The price of solar has dropped by 58% globally in the last five years, driven in part by a sizeable supply glut in the international market. In the United States, solar now accounts for double the number of jobs as the coal industry. China has also played a significant part in this trend. They have been mass-manufacturing solar cells in recent years, to the point of having tariffs imposed on them by several western nations following allegations of dumping and unfair trade practices. The industry has typically offset the challenges of new competition by benefiting from generous environmental subsidies offered by governments. However, this may be a crutch that the industry can no longer rely on, as a strong sentiment in favor of rolling back such subsidies is beginning to emerge in both the United States and the United Kingdom."  Orbotech produces products that complement solar panels: 

 Orbotech finds itself in a different position, however. The company produces products that are complementary to the production of solar cells, so can ride the wave of a global solar supply glut to its advantage. One of its key products is the Aurora PECVD thin film. At the time when the firm received a $10 million order for this system from solar panel manufacturers, the CEO of Orbotech LT Solar commented:    "Conditions in the solar energy industry appear to be improving. Major suppliers are increasing their production levels and stepping up their capital spending, making this a particularly opportune time to introduce our new deposition tool."  The industry of autonomous vehicles, which currently stands on the precipice of being a mass-market industry, will place high demands on products that Orbotech produces. Autonomous vehicles require a large amount of computing power, unlike traditional automobiles, in order to map objects around them using a combination of LIDAR, radar, visual sensors and other technologies. All of this must be done in real time, which means that a huge amount of information is being processed at any one time. In the next few years, it is foreseeable that the most powerful computers being used by consumers will likely be in their cars. Orbotech has created a reputation for its semiconductors which are used in silicon-based processors as well as its advanced printed circuit boards. A spike in the need for computing grunt as autonomous vehicles become commonplace will be favorable for Orbotech. Autonomous vehicles use powerful computers to process real time data: 

 Valuation In this section, we produce a valuation for Orbotech using a comparables analysis. Similar companies operating in the industry have been selected to compare in this case (we did not incorporate Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:ESIO) due to its negative margins and multiples): - Camtek Ltd. (NASDAQ:CAMT) - Screen Holdings Co. Ltd. (OTC:DINRY) - CyberOptics Corporation (NASDAQ:CYBE) - Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) - Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK)     P/E 2017 EV/Sales 2017 EV/EBITDA 2017 Revenue Growth ('16-'17) Operating Margin 2017   Camtek Ltd. 14.5 1.1 13.3 10.0% 12.2%   Screen Holdings Co. NPV 15.7 1.4 10.8 13.9% 13.3%   CyberOptics Corporation 34.0 2.7 17.4 2.0% 19.3%   Applied Materials, Inc. 15.5 3.0 10.7 4.5% 26.7%   Rockwell Automation 26.5 3.3 15.7 3.2% 18.2%   Orbotech 14.9 1.5 7.2 6.2% 17.3%   Average (exc. Orbotech) 21.2 2.3 13.6 6.7% 17.9%   Orbotech is growing in line with the industry and has a very similar expected operating margin. Also, in recent years, its EPS has been growing steadily and is forecasted to keep growing for the next few years. Source: Simply Wall St 

 As a result, the current P/E ratio of 14.9 is quite low, considering Orbotech's strength in relation to other stocks. Applying the average PE multiple of 21.2 would lead to a stock price of $45.6 (+49%); similarly, applying the average EV/sales multiple of 2.3, we get a stock price of $47 (+53%). Finally, applying an EV/EBITDA multiple, the stock price would be worth almost double the current values. However, it should be noted that earnings for the firm tend to be extremely seasonal and vary a lot over time. In the previous earnings call, forecasted Q1 earnings growth were little to nothing, meaning that investors should be aware of the seasonality of the firm's performance. Looking at the below graph that shows the seasonality of revenues per share, it looks like there are quite a few risks in the short term. (Source: GuruFocus) 

 Conclusion Orbotech remains a leader in the fields of electronics manufacturing and process optimization. A booming consumer electronics industry is not a sure thing, but looks likely to continue at least for the foreseeable future. The company is well positioned to mitigate downside risk from a fall in demand. Company activities and investments taking place to take advantage of solar and autonomous vehicles technologies should be watched keenly, as the company stands to benefit significantly from these emerging markets. Orbotech's stock price has been fairly changeable over the past few months. It may well be that the company's solid financial footing and the fact that it stands to gain handsomely from current consumer trends are already priced into its market value. If the price drops significantly in the future without any change in its fundamental outlook, investors should consider buying it. At this stage, we are mostly concerned with the seasonality of the revenues, and we believe that entering during this market phase is a risk. As always, thank you for reading.

Corporate history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Orbotech was founded in 1981 by a team of engineers at Electro-Optical Industry Ltd. (El-Op) led by Shlomo Barak, who was developing electro-optical systems for military use, but saw commercial use for them as well. The company received financial backing from Uzia Galil of Elron Electronic Industries, an Israeli holding company. After 18 months of development, Optrotech was first to market with its first-generation Automated optical inspection product, although a number of other companies also had been working on their own automated inspection systems.[2]
As the first to market, Optrotech was able to become the market leader in its field helping transform the printed circuit board industry, enabling companies to begin the first of a series of productivity improvements. The faster production times and greater volumes helped drive costs down, and the steadily dropping prices of printed circuit boards provided still further stimulation for the development of the global electronics and computer industries.[2]
In 1983, a fellow Israeli company Orbot was founded by brothers Yochai and Kobi Richter,[3] Shimon Ullman, Zvi Lapidot and Ami Caspi; with the financial backing of Ormat Industries.[4] Orbot successfully launched competing automated optical inspection solutions and by 1986 overtook Optrotech as the AOI market leader.
In 1984 Optrotech had an initial public offering on NASDAQ raising $10 million USD. The funds raised enabled Optrotech to develop the next generation of its automated optical inspection technology and launched an effort to diversify its market, beginning development of its first CAD/CAM system.[5]
Merger of Optrotech and Orbot[edit]
In 1991, due to a slowdown in the global AOI market Optrotech and Orbot started discussing a merge of their complementary operations. In August 1992, Optrotech and Orbot reached a merger agreement, in which Orbot absorbed Optrotech, excluding its semiconductor subsidiary Orbot Instruments (which was later sold to Applied Materials). The resulting business was then renamed Orbotech and managed to capture 70 percent of the AOI market.[6]
Growth by diversification and acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Orbotech adapted its technology to provide automatic check processing solutions for financial institutions, launching a new subsidiary Orbograph Ltd.[7]
In 1996, Orbotech established a joint venture with Germany's Jenoptik AG, to develop a laser-based direct imaging system for the production of PCB prototypes. The partnership came under full ownership of Orbotech in 2000.[8]
In 1997, Orbotech acquired the AOI business of Germany's W. Schuh GmbH, a company that specialized in the production of assembled printed circuit board inspection equipment.
In 1998, Orbotech boosted its presence in Japan by acquiring Toyo Ink Manufacturing's PCB sales and marketing operations, as well as Toyo's computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) product line, which was developed by its Israeli subsidiary EIT.[9]
In 1998, Orbotech entered into an agreement with Valor Computerized Systems Ltd. (which is now part of Mentor Graphics), to form Frontline PCB Solutions, a joint venture that develops CAM software for PCB fabrication. Frontline PCB Solutions is owned equally by Orbotech and Mentor Graphics.[10]
Entry into the flat panel displays market[edit]
During the 1990s Orbotech started developing a new automatic inception product line to support the new, fast growing, market of Liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel displays. In 1999, Orbotect acquired Japan's KLA Acrotec from the KLA-Tencor Corporation, which enabled the company to develop a leading position in the LCD Inception market.[11]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Orbotech established its own venture capital arm, Orbotech Technology Ventures Ltd., in order to invest in technology start-ups.[12]
In 2004, as part of the company’s strategy of diversifying into new growth areas for imaging technologies, Orbotech established a new subsidiary Orbotech Medical Solutions Ltd., to focus on the medical market. In 2005, Orbotech Medical acquired Imarad, a privately held Israeli company that developed a technology to manufacture high performance, solid state cadmium zinc telluride gamma radiation detectors, for $7.0 million; and in 2007 Orbotech Medical acquired 3D Danish Diagnostic Development A/S, a privately held Danish company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of gamma cameras for use in nuclear cardiac imaging, for approximately $41.0 million.
In October 2010, Orbotech entered into an agreement with General Electric in which it sold Orbotech Medical Solutions to a subsidiary of GE, GE Medical Systems Israel Ltd. (formerly Elscint Ltd.).[13]
In 2009, Orbotech's Assembly Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) division, which had been started in 1997 by the acquisition of Schuh GmbH, was spun off into a separate company, ORPRO Vision GmbH.[14] The company sells self-contained machines for production line inspection in the automotive electronics, telecommunication, aerospace, medical and industrial electronics industries.
In September 2011, Orbotech's subsidiary Orbograph diversified into healthcare revenue cycle management through the acquisition of Correct Claims Now, a company providing healthcare payments processing services.[15]
In July 2014, Orbotech acquired British company SPTS Technologies, a manufacturer of equipment used to produce Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and semiconductor devices, for total consideration of $371 million.[16]

46shares3430Orbotech LTD., are a leading provider of process innovation technologies, solutions and equipment enabling the transformation of the global electronics manufacturing industry. They have announced that their Orbotech Inkjet™ 600 system has been selected by Amkor Technology, Inc., a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services.
By using the Orbotech Inkjet 600 to print high aspect ratio, 3D underfill dams for new system-in-package (SiP) products, Amkor aims to maximize its manufacturing flexibility, increase its feature position accuracy and reduce its design-to-manufacturing lifecycle.
“Amkor’s use of Orbotech Inkjet 600 for 3D printing is a significant implementation of process innovation in high-volume semiconductor packaging,” said Mr. Kevin Crofton, President of SPTS and Corporate Vice President at Orbotech. “We are experiencing a great deal of interest in inkjet printing from the packaging industry, for applications ranging from underfill dams to package marking to the direct printing of isolation layers.  We believe that this may be the beginning of an industry trend towards adopting additive manufacturing solutions for seamless production processes. Our Orbotech Inkjet 600 offers device manufacturers unprecedented flexibility in product development, reduced cycle times and lower overall cost of ownership.”
“Amkor’s emphasis is on functional integration and size reduction by using different package and interconnect technologies for System-in-Package offerings,” commented JuHoon Yoon, Amkor’s R&D Vice President in Korea. “By investing in solutions such as Orbotech Inkjet 600 for printing of underfill dams as opposed to conventional methods, we enable higher levels of integration in smaller form factors for our customers.”
Underfill dams prevent leakage between active and passive components and are an essential process in SiP packaging for both device and sub-component substrates. With its high-accuracy printing capability, the Orbotech Inkjet 600 enables the formation of tall underfill dams in a single step with real-time local alignment correction for tighter integration of components.  This not only leads to a shorter process by replacing existing cumbersome, subtractive processes, but also significantly lowers manufacturing costs.
Orbotech, together with SPTS Technologies, an Orbotech company, will be exhibiting at SEMICON West, Booth No. 1417 (South Hall) from July 12-14 in San Francisco.

Orbotech: Technology Manufacturing Growth Stock - Orbotech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ORBK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Orbotech: Technology Manufacturing Growth StockFeb.18.17 | About: Orbotech Ltd. (ORBK) GrowthHunter Long/short equity, tech, oil & gas, commoditiesSummaryRecent selloff overblown, offering an attractive entry point.Strong competitive position across technology manufacturing-related product portfolio.Undervalued relative to peers - ~40% upside possible over 12-18 months. On a daily basis, I scan the markets for stocks that have traded sharply lower due to earnings misses, weak guidance or negative press in an effort to find situations where the market has overreacted. Although most of the time there are legitimate reasons behind the size and pace of a selloff, every now and then there are selloffs that are overdone. This is the case with the recent selloff in Orbotech (NASDAQ:ORBK) after the company reported disappointing 4Q2016 earnings and 1Q2017 guidance a few weeks ago. Despite being an industry leader with a top-notch balance sheet and diversified revenue portfolio, the stock fell over 10%, resulting in valuation multiples below its peer group. At these valuations, shares of ORBK have an attractive risk/reward profile as I expect growth to accelerate across their divisions during 2017. Based on those growth expectations, I believe that ORBK's valuation multiple should rebound to trade in line with those of the company's peers. As a result, shares should rebound to between $40-$45, representing ~40% upside from current levels. Overview ORBK is a supplier of yield-enhancing and process-enabling solutions for the electronics products manufacturing industry. In plain English, their products allow companies that manufacture electronics to efficiently produce complex products and minimize defects to maximize output. The Company is comprised of three divisions: Production Solutions for the Electronics Industry, Solar Energy and Recognition Software. The Production Solutions for the Electronics Industry segment, which represents 95% of revenue, includes three sub-segments, Printed Circuit Board (PCB), Semiconductor Devices (SD) and Flat Panel Displays (FPD). 

 Source: Company Presentation In the Flat Panel Display (FPD) market, ORBK's has established a market-leading position in the fastest growing segments, including Flex OLED. This position has resulted in increased bookings for 2017, providing investors with improved visibility versus previous years. In the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) market, ORBK's PCB repair tool allows customers to generate 100% yields in manufacturing, thereby reducing costs and improving profitability. As noted on the 4Q2016 conference call, "the PCB industry is expected to return to positive growth mode" in 2017, and management believes the PCB division will become "an even more meaningful part of our growth". In the Semiconductor Devices (SDD) market, ORBK is the leading company for fan-out packaging, a segment which is expected to grow, and which ORBK should be able to take market share within. Additionally, ORBK is gaining traction in the MEMS market, which the company specifically noted on the 4Q2016 conference call. On the call management noted they expect to "see growth and demand for MEMS coming from the smartphones, automotive, Internet of things and wearables application. As has been widely reported, these industries continue to add a variety of sensors, for example, for automated collision avoidance system, autonomous drive vehicle, and pedestrian sensing in automotive, and new security feature such as fingerprint sensors in small devices." Based on ORBK's competitive position in its three main markets and the expected growth in each I expect sales to increase to $900M and $970M; and EPS to total $2.75/share and $3.30/share during 2017 and 2018 respectively. M&A Growth Prospects In addition to expecting strong organic revenue and earnings growth, ORBK has the balance sheet capacity to make additional strategic acquisitions. Specifically, investors are hopeful that the company makes an acquisition in adjacent markets or further up the value chain. However, in addition to having the financial capacity to make acquisitions, I believe ORBK management has proven their ability to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitions that deliver significant value for shareholders. In 2014, ORBK acquired SPTS, a UK-based manufacturer of etch and deposition processing equipment company targeting advanced packaging and MEMS markets. The acquisition, which is now the SDD division of ORBK, cost the company ~$370M ($300M in debt, $90M in cash) and was priced at ~2x sales. Over the last 3 years, the acquisition has proven to be well-timed and well-executed. Since the acquisition, the Fan-Out, advanced packaging and MEMS product lines have driven SDD division a CAGR of ~25% and supported overall company revenue growth. 

 Source: Jefferies In addition proving their ability to identify attractive acquisition targets and execute after closing, management has proven its ability to responsibly manage debt loads following acquisitions. As of EOY2016, the company had reduced total debt to ~$88M. 

 Source: SimplyWall.st As reflected in the Jefferies analysis below, the company is in a strong position on both a cash/debt basis and Net Debt / FCF basis. 

 Source: Jefferies Given its strong financial position, I would expect the company to pursue another large, strategic acquisition in the next 12 months. Based on management's proven ability to create shareholder value through M&A, as represented by the STPS acquisition, I believe any M&A announcement would be a positive catalyst for the share price. Valuation Following the company's 4Q2016 earnings call, on which the company reported weaker than expected 4Q2016 results and 1Q2017 guidance below consensus, shares plunged over 10%. 

 Source: YCharts, Internal Model To recap, the company reported 4Q16 revenue of $215M (up +5% Q/Q, +14% Y/Y), which was below the midpoint of guidance and consensus due predominantly lower SD sales (down 14% Q/Q). One bright spot of the report was the strength in the FPD and PCB segments, which were +20% Q/Q and +12% Q/Q, respectively. Gross margin came in at 46.8%, which was below both guidance and consensus and was attributed to product mix, foreign exchange and hedging losses. Overall the lower revenue and lower margins led to EPS of $0.70, which was $0.07 below consensus. As a result of the slow SDD sales in 4Q2016, the company revised its guidance lower for 1Q2017, which put further pressure on the shares. Although it is never great when companies miss and guide lower, I believe the underlying reason for ORBK's 4Q2016 performance and 1Q2017 guidance (lower than expected SDD segment revenue) has been misinterpreted by market participants leading to an overreaction in the share price. Unfortunately, SDD revenues are typically lumpier and a single customer order delay can meaningfully impact revenue. As I see it, the company simply faced SDD order delays during the period and is being conservative for 1Q2017. Despite these short-term headwinds, I believe the SDD division along with the FPD and PCB segments should accelerate through the second half of 2017. In contrast to my view, the market seems to be discounting ORBK's 2017 growth potential because one segment underperformed for one quarter, and that to me represents an opportunity to buy. Due to the selloff, ORBK not only has underperformed its peers on a historical basis but is also undervalued on a variety of historical metrics. In my analysis I included Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), Nova Measuring (NASDAQ:NVMI), Nanometrics (NASDAQ:NANO) and Teradyne (NYSE:TER). 

 Source: YCharts, Internal Model In addition to being undervalued on a historical basis, the company also seems to be undervalued relative to its future growth. 

 Based on my EPS and Sales targets, which are in line with many sell-side analysts, if ORBK traded at peer average PE or P/S ratio levels, the share price would be meaningfully higher. Based on the peer average PE / 2017E Earnings ratio of 15.6x and target earnings of $2.75/share, the stock is trading at a 39% discount to the fair value price of ~$43/share. Risks Despite its growth prospects and valuation, there remain risks associated with an investment in ORBK. First, should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, causing a decrease in spending by ORBK's customers, my earnings estimates and price target would be negatively impacted. Second, given that ORBK operates in a cyclical business, should electronics demand weaken or capital investment in China slow, it would materially impact ORBK's stock price. Additionally, ORBK has relatively high customer concentration and geographic (China and larger Asian-Pacific region) concentration risk. Should one of their major customers reduce spending or a regional macroeconomic event unfold in Asia, ORBK would be negatively impacted. Finally, while I believe ORBK has a strong competitive position in the markets it operates in, there is always the risk that competition drives prices and margins lower. Summary As a leading supplier of solutions that are critical in the time-to-market sequence of its technology-focused customers, ORBK is ideally positioned to benefit as demand for mainstream products, such as smartphones, tablets, monitors, and flat panel TVs increases for the foreseeable future. The company has a strong competitive position, the firepower to make another strategic acquisition and is undervalued relative to its peers across a variety of metrics. I believe an investment in ORBK offers an attractive risk/reward profile at these price levels following the overreaction of the market to the most recent earnings release.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Corporate history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Orbotech was founded in 1981 by a team of engineers at Electro-Optical Industry Ltd. (El-Op) led by Shlomo Barak, who was developing electro-optical systems for military use, but saw commercial use for them as well. The company received financial backing from Uzia Galil of Elron Electronic Industries, an Israeli holding company. After 18 months of development, Optrotech was first to market with its first-generation Automated optical inspection product, although a number of other companies also had been working on their own automated inspection systems.[2]
As the first to market, Optrotech was able to become the market leader in its field helping transform the printed circuit board industry, enabling companies to begin the first of a series of productivity improvements. The faster production times and greater volumes helped drive costs down, and the steadily dropping prices of printed circuit boards provided still further stimulation for the development of the global electronics and computer industries.[2]
In 1983, a fellow Israeli company Orbot was founded by brothers Yochai and Kobi Richter,[3] Shimon Ullman, Zvi Lapidot and Ami Caspi; with the financial backing of Ormat Industries.[4] Orbot successfully launched competing automated optical inspection solutions and by 1986 overtook Optrotech as the AOI market leader.
In 1984 Optrotech had an initial public offering on NASDAQ raising $10 million USD. The funds raised enabled Optrotech to develop the next generation of its automated optical inspection technology and launched an effort to diversify its market, beginning development of its first CAD/CAM system.[5]
Merger of Optrotech and Orbot[edit]
In 1991, due to a slowdown in the global AOI market Optrotech and Orbot started discussing a merge of their complementary operations. In August 1992, Optrotech and Orbot reached a merger agreement, in which Orbot absorbed Optrotech, excluding its semiconductor subsidiary Orbot Instruments (which was later sold to Applied Materials). The resulting business was then renamed Orbotech and managed to capture 70 percent of the AOI market.[6]
Growth by diversification and acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Orbotech adapted its technology to provide automatic check processing solutions for financial institutions, launching a new subsidiary Orbograph Ltd.[7]
In 1996, Orbotech established a joint venture with Germany's Jenoptik AG, to develop a laser-based direct imaging system for the production of PCB prototypes. The partnership came under full ownership of Orbotech in 2000.[8]
In 1997, Orbotech acquired the AOI business of Germany's W. Schuh GmbH, a company that specialized in the production of assembled printed circuit board inspection equipment.
In 1998, Orbotech boosted its presence in Japan by acquiring Toyo Ink Manufacturing's PCB sales and marketing operations, as well as Toyo's computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) product line, which was developed by its Israeli subsidiary EIT.[9]
In 1998, Orbotech entered into an agreement with Valor Computerized Systems Ltd. (which is now part of Mentor Graphics), to form Frontline PCB Solutions, a joint venture that develops CAM software for PCB fabrication. Frontline PCB Solutions is owned equally by Orbotech and Mentor Graphics.[10]
Entry into the flat panel displays market[edit]
During the 1990s Orbotech started developing a new automatic inception product line to support the new, fast growing, market of Liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel displays. In 1999, Orbotect acquired Japan's KLA Acrotec from the KLA-Tencor Corporation, which enabled the company to develop a leading position in the LCD Inception market.[11]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Orbotech established its own venture capital arm, Orbotech Technology Ventures Ltd., in order to invest in technology start-ups.[12]
In 2004, as part of the company’s strategy of diversifying into new growth areas for imaging technologies, Orbotech established a new subsidiary Orbotech Medical Solutions Ltd., to focus on the medical market. In 2005, Orbotech Medical acquired Imarad, a privately held Israeli company that developed a technology to manufacture high performance, solid state cadmium zinc telluride gamma radiation detectors, for $7.0 million; and in 2007 Orbotech Medical acquired 3D Danish Diagnostic Development A/S, a privately held Danish company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of gamma cameras for use in nuclear cardiac imaging, for approximately $41.0 million.
In October 2010, Orbotech entered into an agreement with General Electric in which it sold Orbotech Medical Solutions to a subsidiary of GE, GE Medical Systems Israel Ltd. (formerly Elscint Ltd.).[13]
In 2009, Orbotech's Assembly Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) division, which had been started in 1997 by the acquisition of Schuh GmbH, was spun off into a separate company, ORPRO Vision GmbH.[14] The company sells self-contained machines for production line inspection in the automotive electronics, telecommunication, aerospace, medical and industrial electronics industries.
In September 2011, Orbotech's subsidiary Orbograph diversified into healthcare revenue cycle management through the acquisition of Correct Claims Now, a company providing healthcare payments processing services.[15]
In July 2014, Orbotech acquired British company SPTS Technologies, a manufacturer of equipment used to produce Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and semiconductor devices, for total consideration of $371 million.[16]

Corporate history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Orbotech was founded in 1981 by a team of engineers at Electro-Optical Industry Ltd. (El-Op) led by Shlomo Barak, who was developing electro-optical systems for military use, but saw commercial use for them as well. The company received financial backing from Uzia Galil of Elron Electronic Industries, an Israeli holding company. After 18 months of development, Optrotech was first to market with its first-generation Automated optical inspection product, although a number of other companies also had been working on their own automated inspection systems.[2]
As the first to market, Optrotech was able to become the market leader in its field helping transform the printed circuit board industry, enabling companies to begin the first of a series of productivity improvements. The faster production times and greater volumes helped drive costs down, and the steadily dropping prices of printed circuit boards provided still further stimulation for the development of the global electronics and computer industries.[2]
In 1983, a fellow Israeli company Orbot was founded by brothers Yochai and Kobi Richter,[3] Shimon Ullman, Zvi Lapidot and Ami Caspi; with the financial backing of Ormat Industries.[4] Orbot successfully launched competing automated optical inspection solutions and by 1986 overtook Optrotech as the AOI market leader.
In 1984 Optrotech had an initial public offering on NASDAQ raising $10 million USD. The funds raised enabled Optrotech to develop the next generation of its automated optical inspection technology and launched an effort to diversify its market, beginning development of its first CAD/CAM system.[5]
Merger of Optrotech and Orbot[edit]
In 1991, due to a slowdown in the global AOI market Optrotech and Orbot started discussing a merge of their complementary operations. In August 1992, Optrotech and Orbot reached a merger agreement, in which Orbot absorbed Optrotech, excluding its semiconductor subsidiary Orbot Instruments (which was later sold to Applied Materials). The resulting business was then renamed Orbotech and managed to capture 70 percent of the AOI market.[6]
Growth by diversification and acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Orbotech adapted its technology to provide automatic check processing solutions for financial institutions, launching a new subsidiary Orbograph Ltd.[7]
In 1996, Orbotech established a joint venture with Germany's Jenoptik AG, to develop a laser-based direct imaging system for the production of PCB prototypes. The partnership came under full ownership of Orbotech in 2000.[8]
In 1997, Orbotech acquired the AOI business of Germany's W. Schuh GmbH, a company that specialized in the production of assembled printed circuit board inspection equipment.
In 1998, Orbotech boosted its presence in Japan by acquiring Toyo Ink Manufacturing's PCB sales and marketing operations, as well as Toyo's computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) product line, which was developed by its Israeli subsidiary EIT.[9]
In 1998, Orbotech entered into an agreement with Valor Computerized Systems Ltd. (which is now part of Mentor Graphics), to form Frontline PCB Solutions, a joint venture that develops CAM software for PCB fabrication. Frontline PCB Solutions is owned equally by Orbotech and Mentor Graphics.[10]
Entry into the flat panel displays market[edit]
During the 1990s Orbotech started developing a new automatic inception product line to support the new, fast growing, market of Liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel displays. In 1999, Orbotect acquired Japan's KLA Acrotec from the KLA-Tencor Corporation, which enabled the company to develop a leading position in the LCD Inception market.[11]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Orbotech established its own venture capital arm, Orbotech Technology Ventures Ltd., in order to invest in technology start-ups.[12]
In 2004, as part of the company’s strategy of diversifying into new growth areas for imaging technologies, Orbotech established a new subsidiary Orbotech Medical Solutions Ltd., to focus on the medical market. In 2005, Orbotech Medical acquired Imarad, a privately held Israeli company that developed a technology to manufacture high performance, solid state cadmium zinc telluride gamma radiation detectors, for $7.0 million; and in 2007 Orbotech Medical acquired 3D Danish Diagnostic Development A/S, a privately held Danish company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of gamma cameras for use in nuclear cardiac imaging, for approximately $41.0 million.
In October 2010, Orbotech entered into an agreement with General Electric in which it sold Orbotech Medical Solutions to a subsidiary of GE, GE Medical Systems Israel Ltd. (formerly Elscint Ltd.).[13]
In 2009, Orbotech's Assembly Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) division, which had been started in 1997 by the acquisition of Schuh GmbH, was spun off into a separate company, ORPRO Vision GmbH.[14] The company sells self-contained machines for production line inspection in the automotive electronics, telecommunication, aerospace, medical and industrial electronics industries.
In September 2011, Orbotech's subsidiary Orbograph diversified into healthcare revenue cycle management through the acquisition of Correct Claims Now, a company providing healthcare payments processing services.[15]
In July 2014, Orbotech acquired British company SPTS Technologies, a manufacturer of equipment used to produce Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and semiconductor devices, for total consideration of $371 million.[16]

Corporate history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Orbotech was founded in 1981 by a team of engineers at Electro-Optical Industry Ltd. (El-Op) led by Shlomo Barak, who was developing electro-optical systems for military use, but saw commercial use for them as well. The company received financial backing from Uzia Galil of Elron Electronic Industries, an Israeli holding company. After 18 months of development, Optrotech was first to market with its first-generation Automated optical inspection product, although a number of other companies also had been working on their own automated inspection systems.[2]
As the first to market, Optrotech was able to become the market leader in its field helping transform the printed circuit board industry, enabling companies to begin the first of a series of productivity improvements. The faster production times and greater volumes helped drive costs down, and the steadily dropping prices of printed circuit boards provided still further stimulation for the development of the global electronics and computer industries.[2]
In 1983, a fellow Israeli company Orbot was founded by brothers Yochai and Kobi Richter,[3] Shimon Ullman, Zvi Lapidot and Ami Caspi; with the financial backing of Ormat Industries.[4] Orbot successfully launched competing automated optical inspection solutions and by 1986 overtook Optrotech as the AOI market leader.
In 1984 Optrotech had an initial public offering on NASDAQ raising $10 million USD. The funds raised enabled Optrotech to develop the next generation of its automated optical inspection technology and launched an effort to diversify its market, beginning development of its first CAD/CAM system.[5]
Merger of Optrotech and Orbot[edit]
In 1991, due to a slowdown in the global AOI market Optrotech and Orbot started discussing a merge of their complementary operations. In August 1992, Optrotech and Orbot reached a merger agreement, in which Orbot absorbed Optrotech, excluding its semiconductor subsidiary Orbot Instruments (which was later sold to Applied Materials). The resulting business was then renamed Orbotech and managed to capture 70 percent of the AOI market.[6]
Growth by diversification and acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Orbotech adapted its technology to provide automatic check processing solutions for financial institutions, launching a new subsidiary Orbograph Ltd.[7]
In 1996, Orbotech established a joint venture with Germany's Jenoptik AG, to develop a laser-based direct imaging system for the production of PCB prototypes. The partnership came under full ownership of Orbotech in 2000.[8]
In 1997, Orbotech acquired the AOI business of Germany's W. Schuh GmbH, a company that specialized in the production of assembled printed circuit board inspection equipment.
In 1998, Orbotech boosted its presence in Japan by acquiring Toyo Ink Manufacturing's PCB sales and marketing operations, as well as Toyo's computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) product line, which was developed by its Israeli subsidiary EIT.[9]
In 1998, Orbotech entered into an agreement with Valor Computerized Systems Ltd. (which is now part of Mentor Graphics), to form Frontline PCB Solutions, a joint venture that develops CAM software for PCB fabrication. Frontline PCB Solutions is owned equally by Orbotech and Mentor Graphics.[10]
Entry into the flat panel displays market[edit]
During the 1990s Orbotech started developing a new automatic inception product line to support the new, fast growing, market of Liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel displays. In 1999, Orbotect acquired Japan's KLA Acrotec from the KLA-Tencor Corporation, which enabled the company to develop a leading position in the LCD Inception market.[11]
2000s[edit]
In 2001, Orbotech established its own venture capital arm, Orbotech Technology Ventures Ltd., in order to invest in technology start-ups.[12]
In 2004, as part of the company’s strategy of diversifying into new growth areas for imaging technologies, Orbotech established a new subsidiary Orbotech Medical Solutions Ltd., to focus on the medical market. In 2005, Orbotech Medical acquired Imarad, a privately held Israeli company that developed a technology to manufacture high performance, solid state cadmium zinc telluride gamma radiation detectors, for $7.0 million; and in 2007 Orbotech Medical acquired 3D Danish Diagnostic Development A/S, a privately held Danish company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of gamma cameras for use in nuclear cardiac imaging, for approximately $41.0 million.
In October 2010, Orbotech entered into an agreement with General Electric in which it sold Orbotech Medical Solutions to a subsidiary of GE, GE Medical Systems Israel Ltd. (formerly Elscint Ltd.).[13]
In 2009, Orbotech's Assembly Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) division, which had been started in 1997 by the acquisition of Schuh GmbH, was spun off into a separate company, ORPRO Vision GmbH.[14] The company sells self-contained machines for production line inspection in the automotive electronics, telecommunication, aerospace, medical and industrial electronics industries.
In September 2011, Orbotech's subsidiary Orbograph diversified into healthcare revenue cycle management through the acquisition of Correct Claims Now, a company providing healthcare payments processing services.[15]
In July 2014, Orbotech acquired British company SPTS Technologies, a manufacturer of equipment used to produce Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and semiconductor devices, for total consideration of $371 million.[16]
