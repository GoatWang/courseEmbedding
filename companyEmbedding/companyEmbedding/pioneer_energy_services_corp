Flarecatcher
Flarecatcher Technology
Pioneer Energy’s Flarecatcher™ line of gas processing plants utilizes our propriety Deep Refrigeration™ technology to provide best in class separation performance. The Flarecatcher extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from raw associated gas at nearly twice the recovery rate of any competing system, rejecting excess low-value ethane, and conditioning dry gas for use in power generation or conversion to CNG or LNG. Flarecatchers are available in trailer mounted and skid mounted configurations to allow fast and easy deployment and redeployment to help meet the often changing needs of oil producers.
All of Pioneer Energy’s Flarecatcher units contain a sophisticated control system that removes the need for on-site operators. The units are monitored through a secure remote connection via local area network, cell phone network, or satellite. A remote staff member can monitor and control Flarecatcher systems from any convenient location worldwide.
Pioneer Energy offers standard Flarecatcher units in a range of gas processing capacities. These standard units are listed below. Each of these units is able to process a wide variety of incoming gas compositions and energy contents. Each unit has a finite amount of inlet compressor capacity and refrigeration duty, so raw gas with higher energy content results in decreased flow (and higher NGL yield), while lower energy content gas results in higher flow (and more lean dry gas for power generation, LNG or CNG). Pioneer Energy’s team can assist in selecting the right equipment to meet your project needs based upon the flow rate and composition of gas to be processed. 


Flarecatcher 400


Built onto a 40' drop deck trailer for easy mobility, this unit provides between 400 MSCFD (1,350 BTU/ft3 gas) and 240 MSCFD (1,800 BTU/ft3 gas) of associated gas processing capacity. The unit also includes a built-in natural gas generator allowing the unit to be completely self-powered.
SPEC SHEET


Flarecatcher 1000

Built onto a 53' drop deck trailer for easy mobility, this unit provides between 1,000 MSCFD (1,350 BTU/ft3 gas) and 600 MSCFD (1,800 BTU/ft3 gas) of associated gas processing capacity.
SPEC SHEET


Flarecatcher 2000

Built onto a 53' drop deck trailer for easy mobility, this unit provides between 2,000 MSCFD (1,350 BTU/ft3 gas) and 1,200 MSCFD (1,800 BTU/ft3 gas) of associated gas processing capacity.
SPEC SHEET


Flarecatcher 3000

Built into four standard 40' shipping containers, this unit provides between 3,000 MSCFD (1,350 BTU/ft3 gas) and 1,700 MSCFD (1,800 BTU/ft3 gas) of associated gas processing capacity.
SPEC SHEET


Flarecatcher 4000

Built into four standard 40' shipping containers, this unit provides between 4,000 MSCFD (1,350 BTU/ft3 gas) and 2,200 MSCFD (1,800 BTU/ft3 gas) of associated gas processing capacity.

Vaporcatchers
Vaporcatcher Technology
Pioneer Energy’s Vaporcatcher™ line of gas processing units capture and process tank battery vapors, providing extremely high NGL yield. The economics of deploying a Vaporcatcher are far superior to those for deploying a Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU) and injecting into a gathering system. If deployed to a site where tank vapors are currently being flared, the Vaporcatcher cuts total emissions by a factor of 4 and C4+ smoky combustion emissions by more than a factor of 12. Applied to a typical tank battery vapor emission of 400 MCFD, a Vaporcatcher produces 8,000 gallons (~30,000 liters) of NGLs per day. 
Pioneer Energy offers standard Vaporcatcher units in 100, 200, and 400 MCFD gas processing capacities.

CALL FOR INFO




Vaporcatcher Flyer
The Vaporcatcher captures and monetizes low pressure NGL rich vapors from oil tank batteries, providing a much better economic return than a Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU).





Distillation Systems
Distillation System Technology
Designed to work in conjunction with Flarecatcher units, Pioneer Energy also offers modular Distillation Systems which further process the produced NGLs, separating these liquids into propane, butane, and natural gas condensate streams. The propane and butane can be recombined to form Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) meeting the specific requirements of any given market, with excess propane (typical for many associated gas streams) being made available for on-site power generation or commercial sale. The remaining heavy hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane+) are referred to as natural gas condensate. This condensate could be blended into transportation fuel, or used to increase the volume of crude oil produced on-site.

Pioneer Energy offers Distillation Systems scaled to process the NGL output flow from each of the standard Flarecatcher units. 





Modular Gas Processing Plants and Custom Engineered Solutions
Solutions For Any Scale Project
Pioneer Energy’s propriety Deep Refrigeration™ technology can be deployed in any size plant to achieve the most complete separation and product capture available in the industry.  For gas streams larger than ~8 MMSCFD Pioneer Energy can provide a skid mounted, modular, completely integrated processing plant. The specific makeup, size, and design of the modules for the plant are selected based on the composition, pressure and flow of the raw gas to be processed, as well as the desired product specifications. Each module is plug-and-play with the other modules in the plant, with all of them managed through our propriety remote plant management software. Pioneer Energy’s engineering team can further customize our modular plants to address customers’ unique challenges such as high CO2 content, H2S removal, etc.

Product Storage Systems
Store Produced Products Until Use or Transport to Market
Pioneer Energy provides pressurized storage and loading systems that are sized to support the output of our Flarecatchers and modular plants. The size and composition of the storage system selected for a particular project is dependent on the gas volume, composition, product specifications and the number of days of on-site storage required.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
