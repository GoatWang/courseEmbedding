 Client Testimonials 
 Realtor | Builder Testimonials 



Client Testimonials
Steve was awesome! Very polite,  professional, and knowledgeable… I will definitely recommend Cornerstone Home  Lending!

Michelle P.  –   Oklahoma City, OK 
We worked with Steve and his team  from a referral of our realtor.  My husband and I were very surprised with  how easy and user friendly the home buying process was through them!  They  also took the time to sit down and explain all of the forms that we were  signing and we really appreciated that.  They are very quick with getting  back to us and answering any questions.  We would work with Steve and his  team at the Oklahoma City Cornerstone Home Lending if we need a lender in the  future and we will definitely be recommending him to any friends.

Tori and Mitchell T. – United States Air Force
Because of Cornerstone, we were  able to buy our dream home with no hassle and stress.  We had many options  from which we could have received lending; however, from day one, our loan  officer had bragged about Cornerstone’s customer service.  He was exactly  right.  We immediately felt comfortable – like family – not just another  number.  When the process started, the senior loan processor was extremely  accessible and easy to communicate with. She answered all our questions  promptly, and made us feel like a friend and not just a client.  We have  used a larger lending company to buy our previous two homes, and the process  was very long and strenuous.  If you are looking to buy a home with no  hassle and in a timely fashion, Cornerstone is the way to go!

Andre and Melody J. – Edmond, OK
THANK YOU so very much Stephen for  all you have done for me and my family!  My wife and I are so  appreciative!  It has been a pleasure working with you!  Again, thank  you so much!  I will be sure to pass your name around to any and all of my  co-workers.  The military is a huge place!  I am sure I will be able  to send some business your way!  THANK YOU AGAIN!!!!!!

Roy, Kathleen, and Tevy B. – Lawton, OK 

Cornerstone did a wonderful job. They provided a smooth transaction and went   above and beyond to make our home buying experience a positive one. They helped   us prepare for different loan scenarios, depending upon whether we were able to   sell our previous home prior the close of our new home. They were very thorough   and maintained communication with us throughout the home buying process. 

Julie and David H. – Oklahoma City, OK

Thank you very much! It has been a pleasure working with you. I have been   very impressed with your responsiveness and the ease of this process being 1,300   miles away.

  I will definitely refer you to anyone who may be in need of a   mortgage! 

  Thanks again to both of you! 

Dee   H. – Edmond, OK 




Realtor | Builder Testimonials
I have worked with Steve Daniels for several years and he has been the   preferred lender for Homes By Taber for the last 5 years. I have always received   the best customer service from him. As a builder I am always getting solicited   by other lenders, but yet Steve has proven himself time and time again with   being very knowledgeable in product, giving everyone timely updates on what   stage the file is at, and always closing on time with no surprises. This is why   I continue to use Steve as our preferred lender for Homes By Taber. 

Taber L. – Homes by Taber
 
 
In 9 years of loving, living and  breathing real estate I have had the opportunity to work with many different  loan advisors, banks and mortgage companies.  Some good, some bad, but  none that even come close to Steve Daniels with Cornerstone.  Day in and  day out he and his team impress me with their unimpeachable integrity,  consistent and timely communication, and incredible commitment to close on time!
Stormi G. – Norman, OK (Realtor,  The Dillard Group)

As a home builder, it is crucial  that we work with an experienced lender. We expect the same level of service  that we strive to provide our clients. Steve Daniels provides both the  experience and service to our clients. He has helped our clients over the years  find the loan products that are right for them and is always accessible for any  questions they might have. Steve and his knowledgeable staff make the  transactions smooth and is  committed to meeting our closing dates.
Brandon R. – Edmond, OK  (Builder, Rader Homes)

I have had nothing but a great experience with Cornerstone. They are   wonderful to work with and always makes sure everything is on schedule. They get   everything done in a very timely manner and are always so helpful. I would   recommend them if asked because of the superb service given. They have always   been extremely informative as well as honest and I have zero complaints! It is   my pleasure to have the privilege of working with them. Thank   you!

Ashley G. – Jay Kinder Real Estate


Steve Daniels is everything I look for in a Mortgage Consultant. His   attention to detail and can do attitude are exactly what I need in today's   market. As a homeowner and real estate broker I have often times looked to   Steve's creativity and expertise to get deals done, get them done fast and on   time, but most importantly get them done right! Steve has always done a great   job for all clients that I've brought to him when purchasing homes. He is always   available, and creative in trying ways to get clients financed in all of their   varied financial situations. And he sees the loan through to closing. I would   highly recommend Steve and still send clients to him.

Brandon   H. – Hart Home Selling Team

Steve Daniels with Cornerstone Home Lending has done a tremendous job over   the years for us. His customer service, integrity, and abilities to complete the   task of homeownership from start to finish are unparalleled in his   industry.

Channing G. – BancWest   Financial

Today,  the procurement of a home loan is a difficult and rigorous process for buyers.  As a realtor, I can always have confidence in Steve Daniels with Cornerstone  Home Lending to simplify and expedite the loan process for my clients… Most of  my client's loans have been fully underwritten with a "clear to  close" issued well in advance of the scheduled close date.

Terri S. – RE/MAX Professionals, Inc.,   Lawton, OK

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
How  can I determine how much home I can qualify for?
What are income and debt ratios?
What are cash reserves?
What is mortgage insurance? 
What are Veterans Affairs (VA) loans? How do I qualify for a  VA loan?
What if I had credit problems in the past or have filed bankruptcy?
What if I recently obtained a new job?
What does "loan-to-value" mean?
How do I "lock in" my interest rate?
What do I need to bring to closing?
How much do I need to insure my home?
What is the Annual Percentage Rate?
Are there any actions I need to avoid before and during the  home-financing process?


Q. How  can I determine how much home I can qualify for?

                   A. Through our online prequalification process, a Loan Officer will work with you to provide an approximate amount of money you can borrow BEFORE you look for a new home. Then, you provide more information and allow your Loan Officer to run your credit report and verify your assets and income. We can even assist you to obtain a complete written credit approval (subject to an appraisal) before you make an offer on a home.
Top of Page

Q. What are income and debt ratios?

A. Your income ratio is your total monthly  housing expense divided by your pre-tax monthly income. Your debt ratio is your total monthly housing expense plus any recurring debts, such as monthly  minimum credit card payment, car payments or other loan payments, divided by  your monthly income. Standard underwriting guidelines suggest a maximum of 28%  for your income ratio and 36% for your debt ratio. However, these ratios may  vary based on your loan program, your financial situation and the amount of  your down payment.

                   Top of Page

Q. What are cash reserves?

A. Your cash reserves are the funds  available to you after your loan closes. They demonstrate your ability to make  payments on your loan, and different loan programs have varying cash reserve  requirements. Some programs may require you to have assets equal to two to six  months of your mortgage payment. Larger cash reserves can be a strong  compensating factor, as they are indicative of your ability to consistently  keep up with your mortgage payments. Depending on your loan program, cash reserves  can be in the form of cash, stocks, bonds or investments. 

Top of Page

Q. What is mortgage  insurance?

A. Mortgage insurance insures Lenders in the event of a borrower's foreclosure. It  is paid for by the borrower, and allows Lenders to grant loans that they would  otherwise not consider. Depending on credit scores and loan structure,  mortgage insurance may be required when the down payment is less than 20%.

Top of Page
 
Q. What are VA loans? Can  I qualify for a VA loan?

                   A. VA loans are for veterans who meet certain  criteria, but active military personnel may also be eligible. They are  guaranteed by the Veteran’s Administration, and they do not require a down  payment. In some cases, the seller may be willing to pay for all or part of the  closing costs, allowing qualified veterans to purchase a home with little or no  money down.

                 To learn if you qualify for a VA loan, obtain an 1880 Form from your Loan  Officer. Once you have completed the form, submit the 1880 Form and your discharge  papers or DD214 to your local VA office to determine your eligibility. 

Top of Page

Q. What if I have had credit problems  in the past or have filed bankruptcy?

                   A. A good credit history is important because it  assures the Lender of your intention to repay your loan. However, a perfect  credit history is not necessary. If your credit score is low, there are steps  you can take toward improving your score. Contact your Loan Officer for the  different program options available.

Top of Page
 
Q. What if I recently obtained a new job?

                   A. While loan program guidelines look for a  two-year job history within the same field, a change to a better position is  considered favorable. If you are a recent college graduate, you may be able to  obtain a loan without a two-year work history.

Top of Page

Q. What does "loan-to-value" mean?

                   A. Loan-to-value (LTV) is the amount of the loan divided by the lesser of  the sale price or appraised value. If you pay 15% of the total cost of the home  as a down payment, you would only need to borrow 85% of the total sales price.  Therefore, your LTV would be 85%.

Top of Page
 
Q. How do I "lock in" my interest  rate?

                   A. Notify your Loan Officer, and they can lock in  the interest rate recently quoted to you. You will be provided with a written  Interest Rate and Price Determination Agreement, which details the interest  rate and terms of the loan you have requested, as well as the period of time  for which the rate is locked. This period may vary between 10 and 60 days,  depending on your projected closing date.

Top of Page 
 
Q. What do I need to bring to closing?

                   A. Closing typically takes place at the title  company, and you and any other borrower named in the mortgage agreement must  bring a valid driver’s license. Also, any funds due at that time must be in the  form of either a cashier’s check made out to the title company or a wire  transfer. 

Top of Page
 
Q. For how much do I need to insure my home?

                   A. It is your responsibility to secure homeowner's insurance on the home you are purchasing prior to closing. Please contact your insurance company to purchase coverage that meets your loan requirements and your needs.  

Top of Page

Q. What is the Annual Percentage Rate?

                   A. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the  cost of your credit expressed as an annual interest rate. Points and other  prepaid finance charges are factored into the APR to show the true yield on the  loan, which is why the APR is often higher than your note rate. The APR can be  compared to the APR on other loan programs to give you a consistent means of  comparing rates and programs.

Top of Page
 
Q. Are  there any actions I need to avoid before and during the financing process?

                   A. Here are some general actions to avoid prior to and during the home-financing process until you receive professional mortgage guidance. 

Don’t       shop for a new home until you are prequalified. 
Do       not pack and ship important documents you will need during the loan       process, such as your W-2 forms, tax returns, bank statements and pay       stubs.

There are also a number of actions you can take during the  process that will require additional documentation, and to prevent confusion,  should be avoided.

Do       not suddenly pay off your debts.
Do       not apply for new credit cards.

            This is my second time doing the Daniel study. I am always challenged in new ways and areas of my life. I find new truths I missed the first time and am amazed at how much I never retained. I love Beth's workbook and she makes it so much easier to understand.

            Exceptional Service
        

            From the loan application process to the closing, Dan Sullivan and Kara Wasserburger gave exceptional service.  Every time I had a question (and I had many along the way), they were both very quick to respond and were always helpful.  Dan was especially helpful at the time we locked the interest rate, and was even able to get us a lower rate after we locked when I saw that the rates had dropped.  We were so appreciative of his work on our behalf.  I also loved the ability to upload documents into the portal.  It's much easier than it used to be, when we had to send documents by mail.  We have purchased several houses over the years, but this was by far the smoothest and most pleasant experience we have had with a home mortgage lender.  I would have no reservations about recommending Home Loans Today and Dan and Kara to others.

            Great Job by Dan and his team!
        

            Dan and his team were very transparent the whole time with the process. HI team was readily available to answer questions by email and phone at all times and closing completed on schedule. I do have to say that my appraisal came back slightly lower than expected which due to this caused the company to only be able to give me a rate 1/8 of a point higher than I wanted but still was less than my current rate and what my lender was trying to offer. All and all I would definitely use him and his team again.

            All smiles in the beginning BUT sad faces in the end
        

            Long story short, Dan was very helpful and informative in the beginning. I asked Dan many a times throughout the process if we were on target to close escrow on time and he reassured me we were. Fast forward to the day before closing and Dan discloses that there's an issue with our home appraisal from two weeks ago that was still not resolved; this was something that was completely out of our, my husband and I's hands. If it were not for the seller of the home, we may still be in escrow. Needless to say we closed escrow late BUT the worst part of it all was that we had to pay a rescheduling fee for our moving services we had scheduled because we did not close escrow on time. Worst first time home buyers experience for my husband and I!!
        

Lindsey's Tip: Look, look, look around!!!

            Dan & Kara were great to work with, I initially started the process with Dan who assisted with getting me qualified for the loan, then worked with Kara after submitting all initial paperwork. Both of them were involved the whole way, and with my difficult employment history it was a nice feeling knowing these two were working for me directly with their internal underwriting dept.

            Dan is great, not so Troy!
        

            Dan Sullivan did a great job as our loan processor. Troy really fell down on the job and made closing very difficult.   He did not call when he was supposed to and called very late to change the time of the closing to one we could not do.  Bless Dan for many calls to get it straightened out and get us closed when we were about to walk away from a very good loan.   As it turned out, Troy sent a substitute  and that was Dan's doing too.  Troy called Maia Whitaker at the last minute and she did a nice job of getting the loan closed, although it was late because Troy didn't arrange the right paperwork for her.
        

Nancy's Tip: Work with Dan and Maia.  Avoid Troy like the plague.

            Sensational refinance experience
        

            Kara & Dan were sensational to work with, walked us through a very tiresome process made even more difficult by an incompetent appraiser whom completed a flawed and tainted appraisal initially, but Dan & Kara stepped up and paid for a 2nd appraisal for us which we were able to use for closing of our refinance. The process was a long one but was not due to any of their control, and what they had control over was flawless.  Kara & Dan are both very well spoken and eloquent in their emails, my preferred form of contact as I often find myself in the field and unable to take phone calls.  I want to give one last grand THANKS to both Kara & Dan for all of their assistance in this process and there is no one else i will turn to for any future mortgage needs i may acquire or require.

            overall satisfied
        

            Though it took some time to go over the process and the docs, the loan closed successfully close to the time was told (a week later).    There was an external investor involved and that caused more delays and the closing day was a little crazy. However overall satisfied with the lender,got a good comparative rate.

            Good rate, decent experience. Room for improvement.
        

            The overall process was okay. We got a good rate, but were promised a better one via an exception. In the end, there was no exception so that better rate that we were hoping for didn't happen. I also caught a number of accounting mistakes on closing that were eventually refunded.
        

Chris Long's Tip: Pay close attention to the numbers in your paperwork.

            Home Loan Review
        

            Had many issues with the loan process.  Information was sometimes requested very last minute even though I gave them everything they asked for initially.  They took out money for my property taxes at closing.  I then found out that my previous lender already paid that so I had to request and wait to get my funds back.  If I never checked with my previous lendor, who knows what would have happened to my money. They charged me a $20 wire fee, but never disclosed that prior to the loan.  They also wired the money to the wrong bank account.    This caused additional delays in getting our cash out amount back.  This was the most disorganized refi I have ever had.

            Great support and the process was easy.  Would have provided 5 stars but a couple of times it seemed that I had to respond quickly and felt rushed at times.  However, overall the experience was well worth it.

            Very pleased with the process.  First time sourcing/using and online refinance and the process was very smooth.  Was kept well informed and if I every had a question the response was very timely and complete.  Closing title agent even met us at our home to gather the final closing signatures.  Great experience and highly recommend.
