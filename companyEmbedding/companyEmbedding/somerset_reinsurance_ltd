Somerset Holdings | History














































Somerset Holdings





  History



 
Founded by John Brooks, Somerset Holdings Ltd (SHL) is a Bermuda based reinsurance intermediary, regulated by the Bermuda Money Authority (BMA). 



SHL’s position as an independent intermediary domiciled in Bermuda places it on the doorstep of the most dynamic reinsurance marketplace in the world. Our relationships with intermediaries and underwriters in the key insurance markets of the UK and United States give us extensive reach and breadth.
John Brooks has over 40 years of experience in the London market, including setting up a Lloyd’s broker in 1990. The Lloyds broker originally started out handling predominately Marine Reinsurance; however, the company quickly developed into a multi-class broking house handling Property, Aviation (airline and GA) as well as Marine.
In 2003, the company was acquired by HRH, a large US broker at the time John remained a director of the company until his departure in December 2007. Somerset Holdings Ltd was formed in 2008 and approved by the BMA during late 2008.

        Somerset Reinsurance Ltd. Completes $375 Million Capital
        Raise
      

        PR Newswire
      

        HAMILTON, Bermuda, Oct. 20, 2016
      



HAMILTON, Bermuda,
        Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/
        -- Somerset Reinsurance Ltd. ("Somerset Re") announced
        today that it has increased its common share capitalization
        to $375 million, including
        investments from three strategic investors and a diverse
        group of high net worth investors. Somerset Re provides
        customized risk management solutions to the life insurance
        and annuity sectors, helping clients efficiently deploy
        capital, improve long-term performance and fund new
        business growth. Somerset Re, formerly known as Weisshorn
        Re, adopted its new name, along with a new brand identity,
        following its move from Switzerland to Bermuda.
      

        "With completion of this capital raise, Somerset Re is well
        positioned to serve the needs of the life insurance
        industry with reliable, long-term reinsurance solutions in
        this persistent low interest rate environment," said
        Pat Kelleher, the Company's
        CEO.
      

        Kelleher noted that Somerset Re's strengths lie in its
        Underwriting and Asset/Liability Management
        expertise.  The average insurance industry tenure of
        Somerset's leadership team is more than 30 years. "Our
        focus is not on generating deals," Kelleher said. "We're
        focused on creating long-term value for our investors and
        clients through deep partnerships based on a consultative
        approach to reinsurance." 
      

        Somerset Re's strategic investors reflect the company's
        emphasis on both reinsurance experience and capital markets
        expertise.
      


Hannover Re, based in Hannover, Germany, is one of the
          world's top five reinsurance companies. In addition to
          investing in Somerset Re, Hannover Re will collaborate
          with the Company to bring comprehensive reinsurance
          structures to the U.S. life and annuity reinsurance
          market.
        

Atlas Merchant Capital LLC was founded to
          participate in compelling market opportunities in the
          financial services sector. Based in New York and London, Atlas Merchant Capital was
          founded by Bob Diamond and
          David Schamis, who
          together with their partners form a complementary
          partnership with extensive operating and investing
          expertise across the financial services landscape.
        


        Further information is available at www.atlasmerchantcapital.com.
      

        "Atlas is very pleased to bring its partnership and
        operational focus to help a very talented management team
        at Somerset build a market
        leading reinsurance business", said David Schamis, Founding Partner of Atlas
        Merchant Capital.
      


George Weiss is the
          founding shareholder and lead investor in Somerset Re.
          Mr. Weiss is Chairman and CEO of Weiss Multi-Strategy
          Advisors LLC, which has a long history of managing assets
          for insurance company clients.
        


         "We are truly fortunate to have a group of investors
        who have the financial strength, capital markets acumen and
        long-term focus that can help us execute on our growth
        strategy," said Kelleher.
