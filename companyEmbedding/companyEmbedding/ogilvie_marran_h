They represent clients both to the court and to opposing parties. Lawyers can represent clients in criminal cases, where a law has been broken, and in civil cases, in which one party is suing another.Lawyers are also important partners in situations that don’t involve the courtroom, advising clients about their legal rights and obligations for personal or business issues. They are trained to interpret complicated systems of laws and navigate the court system.What can a lawyer do for me?First, a lawyer will advise you as to whether or not you actually need legal help. It’s not always obvious whether an issue is a legal matter or something that can be resolved without involving the court system. A lawyer will help you answer these initial questions.Once you’ve decided to hire a lawyer, then they have the power to represent you to the court and to opposing parties. Your lawyer is your most important ally in any legal matter. They provide advice on how to proceed with your legal issue, and prepare important documents for you.If your issue involves going to court, your lawyer will accompany you, and can speak for you. If your legal matter involves mediation or arbitration, your lawyer will negotiate with the opposing party on your behalf.Let's find your lawyerWhat type of lawyer do I need?What practice area should I choose?Many lawyers tend to focus only on one area, or several related areas of law. In your search for the right lawyer, you should look for a lawyer who understands and has experience in the specific area of law for your issue. For example, a divorce lawyer may not be able to help you if you are considering declaring bankruptcy for your business, but a bankruptcy lawyer who understands bankruptcy and business law would be a perfect match. Reputable lawyers will be upfront about their experience and specific focus, but it will save you some time by narrowing your search beforehand.Top 5 practice areas for Avvo  attorneysAvvo attorneys handle cases in over 120 practice areas, including divorce, criminal defense, and bankruptcy.Find the practice area that fits your issueIs practice size and type something I should consider when I’m looking for a lawyer?Practice size is definitely something you should take into account. Some firms consist of only one lawyer, while some firms retain hundreds. There are many different types of law firms, some of which focus on very specific issues, while others may be more general. For instance, a large corporate firm may not help if you only need a lawyer to review a contract or a few documents, but may be the right choice if you are filing a personal injury suit against a large company. If your legal issue involves only small sums of money, or a few documents, a small firm may be more cost-effective. The size of a practice may also determine how quickly you will be able to actually speak to your potential lawyer; larger offices may require you to schedule your initial consultation through a lawyer’s assistant or secretary.Number of Avvo attorneys who offer free consultations25,654Let's find your lawyerHow do I narrow the list of possible lawyers to contact?Should location be a major factor in my search for a lawyer?Location is an important factor in looking for a lawyer to represent you. Since your issue will likely depend on state or local laws and regulations, you will want an attorney who understands the regulations for your location. On the practical side, you will also want a lawyer who has an office that is convenient for you to travel to. Some lawyers are willing to travel to meet you, but may also charge for travel time. It’s usually a good idea to find a lawyer located in your geographical area. Besides legal knowledge of state and local laws, lawyers also have practical local knowledge. Lawyers in specific cities or towns will also have connections to helpful agencies in that city, which will expedite the process of resolving your issue.What are other clients saying about them?One of the best ways to know if an attorney is right for you are reviews. Read what previous clients have said about specific attorneys and their experiences. Once you choose an attorney to contact, read all the reviews about that particular lawyer to get an idea of how they may handle your case and interact with you.Let's find your lawyerWhat fees and costs should I expect?What types of payment do lawyers usually accept?Most lawyers accept standard payment methods, such as cash, check, and credit cards. Sometimes the method of payment will involve part of the amount of a settlement, so be sure to discuss payment options with your lawyer before signing a fee agreement. Most lawyers are also willing to set up a payment plan, if necessary.The minimum rate for most attorneys is $149 per hourWhat is a fee agreement?A fee agreement, or representation agreement, is a payment agreement between a lawyer and a client. It can consist of several pages, or simply one page outlining the agreement. This document covers key issues such as how much you will be expected to pay for services rendered, how the lawyer will be paid, the timeline of payment, and which lawyer (if a multi-lawyer firm) will work on the case. Be sure to read the fee agreement carefully before signing it, so you know exactly what is expected of you and your lawyer.Common payments accepted by Avvo attorneysGlossary of common costs when hiring a lawyerConsultation Fee: A lawyer may charge for you first consultation meeting, but be sure you know the charges before you hire a lawyer. Ask about Consultation fees before you make an appointment, and how the fee is calculated (i.e. by the hour, half-hour, or otherwise).Contingency Fees: A contingency fee means that your lawyer only gets paid this fee if there is a favorable result in your case—a court win or a settlement in your favor. Typically, but not always, these fees consist of around 1/3 of the total settlement or judgment.Flat Fees: A flat fee means that the lawyer charges one price for each consultation, or for an entire case, no matter how much time or work it takes. Be sure to ask other lawyers for comparable rates if offered a flat fee.Hourly Rate: Lawyers often charge an agreed-upon hourly rate for their work, and the work of their assistants. The hourly rate applies to both face-to-face consultations and behind-the-scenes work on your case. A good lawyer will usually be able to estimate the required number of hours per case in advance.Retainer Fee: A retainer fee is an advance payment to an attorney towards the hourly rate in a specific case. Your attorney will place the retainer fee into an account, and deduct money as work on your case progresses. These are usually non-refundable if you choose to terminate the case early.Statutory Fee: Sometimes, state or local law determines a set amount that you owe your attorney for certain services, like bankruptcy cases and probate issues. A court may also set a statutory fee, though this isn’t standard.Court Costs: Be sure that you know whether, and how much, you will owe in court costs for your legal issue. A good lawyer will be able to estimate court costs in a given situation, and whether or not you will be able to obtain court costs from an opposing party in a favorable settlement or judgment.Filing Fees: Courts charge money for people to be able to file lawsuits and other court actions, like divorce and bankruptcy. Ask your potential lawyer to explain these fees before you sign a fee agreement.Secretarial Time: Lawyers charge different hourly rates for their own work and the work of their secretaries and paralegals. Be sure to ask about the difference before you decide to hire a lawyer and sign a fee agreement.Delivery Fees: In some cases, lawyers use courier services to deliver legal documents to opposing parties and to the court. Ask about potential delivery fees before you sign a fee agreement.Let's find your lawyerWhat questions should I ask before I hire a lawyer?What percentage of their cases deal with issues like mine?This is an important question that a reputable attorney should have no problem answering. You want to find a lawyer that has experience dealing with your specific issue, and this question will help you determine whether a lawyer is right for you. Feel free to ask for specific statistics, and for their average verdict/settlement numbers in cases similar to yours.How much experience does this lawyer have? What is their record?Lawyers, like all professionals, will have varying degrees of experience. Understanding a lawyer’s previous experience is essential to understanding how they can handle your case. You’ll want to ask how many years the lawyer has been practicing. A lack of experience doesn’t necessarily make for a bad lawyer, though, especially if they have experienced lawyers around them. This is why you’ll want to ask about their workload: do they handle many cases? How much of each case do they personally oversee, and how much do they delegate to assistants?How will a lawyer contact me?Make sure you and your attorney are on the same page about communication. Ask about their preferred communication methods, and whether they are willing to use your preferred communication methods. Does the lawyer you are considering hiring accept (and respond to) communication via email? Will they respond if you send a text? Make sure they respond promptly (within 24 hours) to your initial inquiries--you don’t want to hire a lawyer who won’t return your calls or avoids prompt communication about your case.What is their availability, should I need to contact them?It’s especially important to understand a potential lawyer’s availability. Will they be going on a three-week vacation in the middle of your case? Do they take phone calls after business hours? Do their legal assistants have a way to contact them if they are not in the office? You should have a good sense of how and when your lawyer will be available to communicate with you.Let's find your lawyerThe Avvo advantageAvvo gives you all the information you need to find the right lawyer.50 states120 areas of lawDetailed profiles including reviews50 states120 areas of lawDetailed profiles including reviewsMore View attorneys by stateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDist. of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingView attorneys by cityAtlanta, GAAustin, TXBaltimore, MDBoston, MABrooklyn, NYBuffalo, NYCharlotte, NCChicago, ILCincinnati, OHCleveland, OHColumbus, OHDallas, TXDenver, CODetroit, MIEl Paso, TXFort Lauderdale, FLFort Worth, TXFresno, CAHouston, TXIndianapolis, INJacksonville, FLKansas City, MOKnoxville, TNLas Vegas, NVLos Angeles, CAMemphis, TNMiami, FLMilwaukee, WIMinneapolis, MNNashville, TNNew York, NYOrlando, FLPhiladelphia, PAPhoenix, AZPittsburgh, PAPortland, ORRaleigh, NCRiverside, CASacramento, CASaint Louis, MOSan Antonio, TXSan Diego, CASan Francisco, CASan Jose, CASeattle, WASpokane, WATacoma, WATampa, FLTucson, AZWashington, DCSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave    Marran Ogilvie | ZAIS Financial Corp. | ZoomInfo.com

LSB Industries and Starboard Value Reach Agreement Regarding 
      Corporate Governance and Board Composition




Company to Add Five New Independent Directors: Louis Massimo, 
      Andrew Mittag, Marran Ogilvie, Richard Roedel and Lynn White


Announces Intention to Separate Chemicals and Climate Control 
      Businesses and to Explore MLP Structure for Chemicals Business Following 
      Completion of El Dorado Facility Expansion in 2016, Subject to Market 
      Conditions and Board Approval


New Lead Independent Director Appointed and Independent Board 
      Committee to Oversee Search for President of Chemicals Business








April 27, 2015 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE:LXU) (“LSB” or “the Company”), a manufacturer 
      of chemical products for the agricultural, mining and industrial markets 
      and a leading manufacturer of commercial and residential climate control 
      products, today announced that it has elected Louis G. Massimo, Andrew 
      K. Mittag, Richard Roedel, Marran H. Ogilvie and Lynn F. White to its 
      Board of Directors. These five new independent directors, as well as 
      incumbent directors Richard Sanders and Barry Golsen, will stand for 
      re-election to LSB’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2015 Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders. Messrs. Massimo and Mittag will fill the 
      vacancies created by the resignations, effective today, of Gail Lapidus 
      and Robert Henry.
    


      If re-elected by LSB’s stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting, Ms. 
      Ogilvie and Messrs. Roedel, Sanders, Golsen and White will have terms 
      expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting and Messrs. Massimo and Mittag will 
      join the class of directors with terms expiring at the 2017 Annual 
      Meeting. With these appointments, the LSB Board will expand to 13 
      directors, 11 of whom are independent and 9 of whom were appointed in 
      the last 24 months.
    

      “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Starboard on the 
      composition of the Board,” said Barry Golsen, Chief Executive Officer of 
      LSB. “On behalf of the entire Board, I would like to thank Gail Lapidus 
      and Robert Henry for their dedicated service and contributions to the 
      Board and LSB. We look forward to working with the new independent 
      directors.”
    

      Mr. Golsen continued, “We remain committed to enhancing stockholder 
      value, and we believe the improvements we are making to increase 
      capacity and upgrade facilities will position LSB for enhanced growth 
      and profitability. We are therefore pleased to announce our intention, 
      once our El Dorado facility expansion projects have been completed and 
      brought online in 2016, to the extent market conditions allow and 
      subject to Board approval, to separate the Company’s Chemicals business 
      from its Climate Control business and to explore an MLP structure for 
      the Chemicals business.”
    

      In connection with today’s announcement, LSB has entered into an 
      agreement with Starboard Value LP (“Starboard”), which beneficially owns 
      approximately 7.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares. Under the 
      agreement, Starboard has agreed, among other things, not to solicit 
      proxies or participate in any “withhold” campaign in connection with the 
      2015 Annual Meeting and to vote its shares in support of all of the 
      Company’s director nominees. Starboard has also agreed to vote all of 
      its shares in accordance with the Board’s recommendation with respect to 
      the Company’s say-on-pay proposal, subject to the recommendation of 
      Institutional Shareholder Services.
    

      In addition, the responsibilities of the Strategic Committee of the 
      Board, which was formed in June 2014, will be expanded to include an 
      evaluation of Company’s corporate governance and management structure, 
      related party transactions and any other governance practices of the 
      Company deemed appropriate by the Strategic Committee. The Strategic 
      Committee will make recommendations to the Board based on its findings, 
      and the Company intends to announce the Board’s decisions with respect 
      to these recommendations concurrent with its second quarter 2015 
      earnings release.
    

      The Company also agreed to form an independent Board Committee to 
      oversee the Company’s previously announced executive search for a 
      President of the Chemicals business; this committee will consist of 
      Messrs. Daniel D. Greenwell, Sanders, Mittag and White. As previously 
      announced the company is working with executive search firm Spencer 
      Stuart to assist in the search.
    

      The Company also announced that Mr. Greenwell was elected Lead 
      Independent Director.
    

      Jeff Smith, CEO of Starboard, stated, “We are pleased that we have been 
      able to continue to work constructively with LSB to reach this 
      agreement, and we look forward to meaningful value creation. We believe 
      that strengthening the Board with highly experienced and independent 
      directors will support the Company in executing on its plans to drive 
      sales growth and profitability for the benefit of all shareholders. 
      Louis Massimo, Andrew Mittag, and Lynn White bring substantial 
      experience in the Chemicals and Fertilizer industries, which should help 
      LSB as it continues its progress in turning around and significantly 
      expanding this business. In addition, Marran Ogilvie and Richard Roedel 
      bring vast corporate governance experience that we believe will be 
      invaluable as the LSB Board reviews its governance practices.
    

      Mr. Smith continued, “We believe that a separation of LSB’s two highly 
      valuable businesses will create substantial value for all shareholders, 
      allowing each business to fully capitalize on the opportunities 
      available and enabling the Chemicals businesses to consider the 
      potential value creation available through an MLP structure following 
      the completion of the El Dorado expansion.”
    

      Credit Suisse is serving as financial advisor to LSB and Wachtell, 
      Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Conner & Winters, LLP are acting as legal 
      advisors.

   Editor Picks  TOP 10s HOW-TO VIDEOS GIFT GUIDES VIRTUAL CITY GUIDES SHOPPING ROUND-UPS 5 FAVORITES YOU'RE THE MAN BESO BY THE NUMBERS BLOG     TOP 10s Whether you're in the market for the perfect party pump, or looking to replace your long-trusted moisturizer brand, look no further than our comprehensive Top 10s, featuring some of the most respected group of experts we've ever had the pleasure of crossing paths with. From Janet Fitzgerald, our favorite SoulCycle instructor to Erin Fetherston, fashion designer extraordinaire, from Nate Berkus, to Mike Farah of Funny or Die — we've got you covered when it comes to fashion, style, beauty, health, fitness, entertaining, entertainment and more.  VIEW ALL TOP 10s      HOW-TO VIDEOS Are you the kind of person that can't match a blouse to a blazer? And then stumbles over which skirt and heel combo to pair it off with? Worry not! Our team of editors and contributors will set you on the right path with our short, informative and fun How-Tos! We'll get you through work weeks and the weekends, special occasions like weddings, interviews, and date nights, and offer up some wise words of wisdom on wardrobe one-offs like chambray shirts and embellished booties. Don't forget to check out our hair, nails and makeup tutorials either!  VIEW ALL HOW-TO VIDEOS       GIFT GUIDES Calling all uncertain gifters and giftaholics alike! At Beso, not only are we obsessed with scoring the perfect item for our own guilty closets, but we're also diehards when it comes to finding presents our friends and families will love and treasure forever. Start off with our Un-Valentine's Day V-Day Gift Guide, or our comprehensive Made In America guide. And it doesn't stop there — we've got guides for mothers-in-law, beauty junkies, the gadget-obsessed, travelers, and much, much more. VIEW ALL GIFT GUIDES      VIRTUAL CITY GUIDES Sure, nothing beats an actual afternoon strolling through a great shopping neighborhood—but here at Beso, we've cobbled together a close second best. From Abbot Kinney Boulevard,  a haven of independent boutiques and trendy restaurants to Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, chock full of quant boutiques, to London's Notting Hill neighborhood, we've walked the streets and shopped the shops. Just tack on a lazy Sunday brunch and you're all set, or alternatively, check out the wares of the shops we love in the comfort of your own home, all made shoppable, online.  VIEW ALL VIRTUAL CITY GUIDES       SHOPPING ROUND-UPS It's no secret that at Beso you'll find the seriously shopping obsessed — and we mean obsessed in a good way! We love our Shopping Roundups because they'll walk you through how to create a specific look, break down your favorite celebrity's style, and save you when it comes to tricky trends that take a little finesse and good old fashioned know-how. From holiday season round-ups, to summer dresses under $100, to an indoor gardening guide, it no longer takes a team of savvy stylists, interior decorators and beauty experts to get the looks you love.  VIEW ALL SHOPPING ROUND-UPS      5 FAVORITES Great things comes in fives! At least, that's what we've discovered here at Beso when it comes to shopping. From finding the best sunglass shape for your face, to testing the five shoe styles we can't wait to rock next spring, we keep it real when picking through thousands of products to include in our quick and easy 5 Favorites features. We've also tapped a sartorially-inclined group of movers and shakers to find out more about what makes up their 5 Favorite Outfits and we must say, the results are extremely stylish!  VIEW ALL 5 FAVORITES       YOU'RE THE MAN There are just some men that have an incredibly, well, manly, air about them. And then there are men whose effortless style and swagger is much replicated, but never quite perfected. And even more mystifying is the rare breed that are indelibly both — men whom women love and other men want to be. We've analyzed a shortlist of the styling of men that fall into this category (Elvis, Joe Namath, et. al.) and we've realized that no matter how you try, these fellas are just a breed of their own.  VIEW ALL YOU'RE THE MAN      BESO BY THE NUMBERS When it comes to the things we care about, we can be known to take a more, let's say, calculated approach. We've crunched the numbers and compared the stats and are presenting up the information in digestible and fun infographics! From our in-depth shoe survey, to finding out more about the benefits of juicing, we're on a mission to uncover all the facts. And seriously, it can't just be us that geek out over knowing the exact percentage of women that own Loubotins vs. Uggs, right?? VIEW ALL BESO BY THE NUMBERS
