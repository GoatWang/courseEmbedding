Product Description▼▲
In this volume, Dr. J. Vernon McGee explores the book of Daniel revealing the fulfilled prophecies found within. Accordingto Dr. McGee, Daniel was not a deceiver, his book was not a forgery, and Daniel's life can be summarized in three words: purpose, prayer, and prophecy.  Radio messages from J. Vernon McGee delighted and enthralled listeners for years with simple, straightforward language and clear understanding of the Scripture. Each volume in the Thru the Bible Series includes introductory sections, detailed outlines and a thorough, paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the text.

            Dr. McGee's study guide to the Book of Daniel was excellent.  It was a very useful and resourceful tool for our Bible study class.  He translates each verse into layman's terms.  He made studying prophecy so easy to understand.  I highly recommend this text.

            I just did a study on Daniel, and McGee's book was so much help, to delve further into what Daniel saw and related.  I have several other books by McGee, and everyone have helped me in whatever study I was doing.  They are well worth the money.

            Mr. McGee is certainly a well known and wonderful writer bringing many a descriptive feature to the fore front. Very enjoyable.

Product Description▼▲
In this volume, Dr. J. Vernon McGee explores the book of Daniel revealing the fulfilled prophecies found within. Accordingto Dr. McGee, Daniel was not a deceiver, his book was not a forgery, and Daniel's life can be summarized in three words: purpose, prayer, and prophecy.  Radio messages from J. Vernon McGee delighted and enthralled listeners for years with simple, straightforward language and clear understanding of the Scripture. Each volume in the Thru the Bible Series includes introductory sections, detailed outlines and a thorough, paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the text.

                This review was written for Daniel, Thru The Bible.
            
 
            Dr. McGee's study guide to the Book of Daniel was excellent.  It was a very useful and resourceful tool for our Bible study class.  He translates each verse into layman's terms.  He made studying prophecy so easy to understand.  I highly recommend this text.

                This review was written for Daniel, Thru The Bible.
            
 
            I just did a study on Daniel, and McGee's book was so much help, to delve further into what Daniel saw and related.  I have several other books by McGee, and everyone have helped me in whatever study I was doing.  They are well worth the money.

            Mr. McGee is certainly a well known and wonderful writer bringing many a descriptive feature to the fore front. Very enjoyable.
