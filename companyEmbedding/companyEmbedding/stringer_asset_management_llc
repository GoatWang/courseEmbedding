Studies by industry group, DALBAR, suggest that over the last 20 years
                                        ending in 2016, equity mutual fund investors have captured only 62% of 
                                        the return of the U.S. stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 
                                        Index. Bond investors fared even worse according to this study. The
                                        employees of Stringer Asset Management have dedicated their careers 
                                        to helping investors close the gap between the opportunities that the 
                                        financial markets present and the returns that investors actually realize.

The Cash Indicator
We have found that the excessive correlation of certain volatility indicators related to the equity and fixed income markets provides us with an early warning system and a well-defined process for identifying extreme outlier markets. Our studies have shown that significant preservation of capital and enhanced return can be achieved when we are able to exit the equity and alternative markets during these events. Our process allows us to increase the cash allocation up to 25% or 50% of the portfolio during those events and, hopefully, redeploy that cash in the future at more attractive valuations.

Investors want to know that during turbulent markets there is an effort to identify and take advantage of the opportunities that exist in every market, and allows for a tilt to a more environmentally relevant asset allocation regardless of what the general market is providing in terms of returns.
Our clients demand a strategy that attempts to protect their assets during extreme market downturns. The Cash Indicator (CI) offers a well-defined methodology to get out of the way during outlier events and back in when the markets begin to normalize. Importantly, the CI takes the emotion out of the decision making process.

The Investment Journey
Modern Portfolio Theory forms the basis of our investment management philosophy; however, we believe that it has certain limitations which require additional qualitative judgments.

We pursue global investment opportunities beyond the traditional "style box" approaches. We implement our investment themes primarily utilizing ETFs for diversification, specificity and cost control.
We anchor our portfolios with strategic asset allocations that are based on our proprietary capital market expectations for the next 3-5 years.
We complement our strategic asset allocations with tactical asset allocations that attempt to take advantage of the near-term opportunities that exist in every market.
We overlay our proprietary Cash Indicator to help identify periods of time when it may be advantageous to temporarily raise our cash allocation to 25% or 50% of the portfolio so that we might be able to redeploy the cash in the future at lower market valuations.

Managing Asset Allocation

Click here to enlarge
Asset allocation is the most influential factor in determining the variations in portfolio returns.1 Therefore, we actively manage our asset allocations to focus our portfolios on areas where we see the best opportunities for future returns.

Click here to enlarge
We believe blending strategic and tactical allocations will help investors realize better investment results than utilizing either approach independently. Our strategic approach takes a 3- to 5-year view of the markets and is a reflection of our medium-term expectations for the capital markets. Our tactical allocation is focused on identifying the near-term opportunities.

The graph shown is for illustrative purposes only. Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The indices represented do not bear transaction costs or management fees, and cannot be actually bought or sold. To the extent a shareholder pays sales charges, the performance shown would be less. All indices are unmanaged and investors can not invest directly in an index. For index definitions, see the Index Definitions section at the end of this document.
Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index. Bonds are represented by the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Alternatives are represented by an equally-weighted blend of the CBOE BuyWrite Index, FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index and the S&P GSCI Index.
Alternative or non-traditional investments are a key differentiator for Stringer Asset Management and a central part of our investment management process. Using these types of non-traditional assets can help boost returns and reduce volatility over time.
We follow a multi-step process for investment selection to ensure that we are implementing our ideas in the best manner. Investments that are selected for inclusion in our portfolios are constantly reviewed, and we are always looking for new and innovative ideas that better fit our investment themes.

First Trust SSI Strategic Convertible Securities ETF(NASDAQ:FCVT): Active Bond Management Looking Attractive | ETF Daily News

































 































































The Ultimate Guide To Convertible Bond Strategy ETFs


 May 11, 2017 10:53am  NASDAQ:FCVT  



 




While we expect equity markets to continue strengthening with improving economic conditions, we do see potential risks. The geopolitical environment, monetary policy, upcoming changes to the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) regime, and the ability of the Trump Administration to get policy passed in D.C. all pose threats to markets.




These threats can cause shifts in market sentiment and volatility, which can have negative impacts to investors despite improving conditions. Strategies that offer investors some continued upside potential but may protect more in a down market should be considered. One asset class we tend to favor in this type of environment is convertible bonds.
Convertibles bonds are hybrid securities, combining characteristics of both equities and traditional bonds, as each convertible bond is exchangeable for equity shares. As equity prices move upward, the value of the convertible bond moves up to a degree based on its conversion feature. This can lead to a healthy degree of equity sensitivity as equities move higher.

However, as equities sell off the convertible bond will fall, but generally will find support to the downside as it begins to be valued for its fixed income characteristics, such as the return of principal and interest payment.

As the chart above demonstrates, a convertible bond may go through different phases during its life depending on the underlying equity price and the conversion feature. When the underlying equity price is below the conversion price, the convertible will tend to act more like a debt security rather than equity. As the equity price increases, the bond’s value will also increase due to the conversion feature. As the underlying equity price converges with the conversion price, the investor enters a sweet spot where they are participating more in the equity upside, while also collecting interest payments. As the equity price continues to rise, more equity sensitivity is experienced. However, as equity prices fall, the bond finds support again as it re-enters the middle or defensive range where it is supported by the convertible’s fixed income features.
Recently, we have seen improving fundamentals and believe we will continue to see GDP growth in 2017. Job creation remains on a positive trajectory, as we have seen continued strength in jobless claims and income levels. This strength should lend support to consumer sentiment and spending.

Business sentiment is also optimistic. The Conference Boards’ U.S. Leading Index continues to improve and we are seeing continued growth in production. While all these factors should support equity markets, we remain concerned with volatility and downward pressure from several areas. Geopolitical risks are high as the U.S. has changed tone with the new administration on number of fronts. For example, recent strikes in Syria by the U.S. have strained U.S. and Russian relations further. North Korea continues to be problematic and the world will be adjusting to new trade negotiations, which could create tensions. Domestically, we are starting an internal battle between fiscal and monetary policy as the Fed raises rates and plans the suspension of reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds, thus reducing the size of their balance sheet. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in the future of Fed policy as we prepare for a Fed regime change with the end of Janet Yellen’s term next February. Also, there is uncertainty surrounding the passing and timing of many fiscal policies aimed at supporting further U.S. economic growth through tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and the roll back of tedious regulations.
Walking a fine line between giving up potential equity upside from a strengthening economy and managing downside risks and volatility is challenging. We believe incorporating asset classes that offer some upside with a downside protection mechanism, such as convertible bonds, can be beneficial in this environment.
There are several ETF options in the space for investors looking to incorporate convertible bonds into their portfolio. The iShares Convertible Bond ETF (ICVT) tracks the Bloomberg Barclay’s U.S. Convertible Cash Pay Bond> $250mm Index, which isolates convertible bonds with issue sizes above $250mm. The Fund has an expense ratio of 0.20%. Similarly, the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities ETF (CWB) is a passively managed strategy that is designed to track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Convertible Bond >$500mm Index. This option is restricted to larger issue sizes and has an expense ratio of 0.40%. Finally, for investors interested in active management, the First Trust SSI Strategic Convertible Securities ETF (FCVT) is managed by SSI Investment Management and has an expense ratio of 0.95%.

At the time of writing, Stringer Asset Management LLC (SAM) clients owned CWB. SAM is a Memphis, TN third-party investment manager and ETF strategist. Contact SAM at 901-800-2956 at info@stringeram.com.
BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Convertibles Index consists of convertible bonds traded in the U.S. dollar denominated investment grade and non-investment grade convertible securities sold into the U.S. market and publicly traded in the United States. The Index constituents are market value weighted based on the convertible securities prices and outstanding shares, and the underlying index is rebalanced daily.
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index measures the performance of the U.S. investment grade bond market. The index invests in a wide spectrum of public, investment-grade, taxable, fixed income securities in the United States – including government, corporate, and international dollar-denominated bonds, as well as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, all with maturities of more than 1 year.
S&P 500 Index measures the performance of the large capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market and is considered one of the best representations of the domestic economy. Utilizing a market-cap weighting structure, this index invests in the 500 largest U.S. firms. All companies must have a 50% public float to be considered for inclusion in the benchmark.
