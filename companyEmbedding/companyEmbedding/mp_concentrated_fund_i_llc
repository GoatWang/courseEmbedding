                                                            Avoid inadvertently raising glycerol concentrations.






Highly reproducible results
Ideal for TA cloning
Ultra pure enzyme
Highly processive




                                                            Certain PCR applications require a high concentration of Taq DNA Polymerase. However, adding larger volumes of Taq DNA Polymerase will increase the glycerol concentration in the reaction mix (Taq DNA Polymerase storage buffer contains 50% glycerol to prevent freezing) and high glycerol levels can interfere with PCR. To avoid inadvertently raising glycerol concentrations in the final mix, Taq DNA Polymerase at 15U/ųL concentration is recommended. Highly processive, recombinant, thermostable 5'-3' DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of mononucleotide units to the 3'-OH end of a primer chain. Remains functional even after prolonged incubation at 95° C. This enzyme possesses 5'-3' exonucleases activity. Quality control performed on every lot of enzymes: Specific PCR on genomic and phage templates, activity check, absence of ribonucleases, absence of nickases and endonucleases, absence of 3' exonucleases, purity on SDS-PAGE, absence of proteases.Unit Definition: One unit is the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the incorporation of 10nmol of nucleotides into acid-insoluble material in 30 minutes at 74° C under assay conditions.

Shareholder Reports

The FMI Large Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through the purchase of a limited number of large capitalization value stocks. The Fund extends the core philosophy of the management company (Fiduciary Management, Inc.), buying good businesses at value prices, beyond the small to mid-capitalization range. Some of the characteristics of good businesses may include strong recurring revenue and attractive returns-on-investment capital. A strong orientation to low absolute or relative valuation is key to the execution of the investment strategy. As a non-diversified fund, the FMI Large Cap Fund tends to concentrate its investment on fewer companies than a diversified mutual fund. The Fund holds approximately 20-30 stocks, with most major industry groups represented.
Please refer to the Prospectus for a more detailed explanation of the FMI Large Cap Fund, the management, and an Application.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
