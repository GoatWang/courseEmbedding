First PagePreviousNextLast PageSee what's new at LennarWelcome to the Bayou City.Urban sophistication meets southern charm deep in the heart of Texas! Houston is a city of diverse residents who love the Symphony and Theater Under the Stars with the same passion as Goode Company BBQ. And with mild weather year-round,  Houston is an outdoor city with over 49,000 acres of park to run, bike, hike, kayak and much more. Add in award-winning restaurants, an exciting nightlife, world-renowned shopping and year-round festivals, and it’s no wonder so many have chosen to make the Bayou City home.Energy capital of the world.Thanks to a business economy as booming as it is diverse, Houstonians do more than enjoy the great outdoors. From oil exploration and medical research to agriculture and education, Houston’s economy makes the city attractive to businesses, international corporations and entrepreneurs looking for unlimited opportunity. It’s not surprising that 23 Fortune 500 companies have chosen to set up headquarters in Houston. Although nicknamed Energy Capital of the World, Houston’s world-class Medical Center can’t be overlooked. The largest medical center in the world employees over 50,000 people and sees millions of patients every year.

First PagePreviousNextLast PageSee what's new at LennarWork hard, play hardAs the base for 75% of NASCAR’s race teams, Charlotte knows a thing or two about high-octane pursuits. The Carolina Panthers and the Charlotte Hornets call Queen City home, and you’ll find even more thrills at Carowinds Amusement Park and the U.S. National Whitewater Center, an artificial whitewater river with Class 4 rapids. This is a place that plays hard, but also offers quieter pursuits like fishing and boating on the Catawba River and Lake Norman, as well as museums and performing arts venues.Gateway to the SouthCharlotte anchors a two-state, 16-county region that lies in the heart of the Southeast. It’s easy to get here from anywhere in the country, hence its nickname “the Gateway to the South.”Headquarters for eight Fortune 500 companies, the Charlotte area is the nation’s second-largest financial center as home to both Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Energy, foodstuffs, and transportation have also fueled the incredible growth of the past decades, which has led to Charlotte being named one of the “Best Places for Business and Careers” by Forbes in 2013.Charlotte is a great place to work, and a fun place to live. Lennar has new homes for sale throughout the metro Charlotte area and in upscale surrounding communities such as Waxhaw, Fort Mill, and Davidson.

Lennar Announces New Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Homes 
The national home builder is the first to offer home designs with seamless wireless technology certified by Wi-Fi Alliance and also feature integrated home automation and voice control with Amazon Alexa. 

                    By 
                        Lauren Shanesy



Lennar Corp., Miami (NYSE:LEN) has launched the nation's first Wi-Fi CERTIFIED homes, which integrate pre-installed wireless technology to provide coverage in every room with no dead spots. The Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Home Design standard is an initiative of Wi-Fi Alliance, a worldwide network of companies that drives the adoption of wireless technology. Lennar is the first builder to adopt the standard. The Wi-Fi CERTIFIED homes bring a new kind of seamless, turnkey feature to the home building market with Wi-Fi that offers consistent and amplified coverage compared to a traditional boxed router. 








"Wi-Fi has become one of the most widely used and successful technologies of our day. It delivers over half of all internet traffic, and it's absolutely foundational to connectivity today," says Kevin Robinson, Wi-Fi Alliance vice president of marketing, who notes that the average home has about 8 connected devices running between cell phones, tablets, and entertainment devices, and the industry is only continuing to add more. As such, consumers have come to expect that Wi-Fi is always available."Users want a seamless experience where the technology itself just fades into the background," Robinson continues. "That's when you're truly successful as a technology, when individuals can accomplish what they need to accomplish but they almost don’t even realize they're using the technology. That's the goal for us all, including home builders-- to provide a seamless, turnkey experience in their homes with a Wi-Fi network that meets high connectivity coverage and performance standards." The process of creating a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED home puts every floor plan through a rigorous testing process that maps signal strength and quality to determine where to place access points, which are built right into the home during construction for maximum, uninterrupted coverage. The process takes into account the best kinds of enclosures for routers and the building materials and other factors that can affect connectivity. The home is the serviced with Ruckus Wireless Smart Wi-Fi technology, an affordable wireless LAN solution that can be deployed in minutes. "As the home builder constructs the home, they're able to place access points wherever they make the most sense and where they will maximize performance, not where a service provider might happen to drop a cable gateway," says Robinson. "At Wi-Fi Alliance, we are able to do a 3rd-party, neutral evaluation to make sure the home is going to deliver a good experience and will just simply work for the owner."The homes will also be fully integrated with home automation and voice control from Amazon Alexa, built right into the structure. Homeowners will be able to control their lights, front door lock, or thermostat, for example by talking to Alexa. Lennarfxwyvuwtwuaftsd has also partnered with leading manufacturers in the smart home space such as Ring, Honeywell, Kwikset, Lutron, and Samsung to integrate wireless home automation products that pair with Amazon Alexa into their new construction. "Consumers that are excited about [Wi-Fi and home automation]. But what detracts from their excitement is complexity, and a challenge of the IoT industry has been demonstrating to consumers how simple this can be," says David Kaiserman, president of Lennar Ventures. For this reason, partnering with Amazon, a company that Kaiserman touts as the definitive authority on voice control, commerce, and service, was the most logical choice for attracting consumers.  "Introducing Amazon gives homeowners an almost quintessential experience that’s not actually about technology itself, but about how it fits into their life," he says. As the wireless technology is integrated into the building plans from the ground up, Kaiserman thinks the process is no different than any other aspect of building a home. "Builders are engineers at the core. We engineer HVAC systems and plumbing to work and walls to stay up," he says. "So, if we are to respond to consumers' needs appropriately, we should be building homes with wireless in mind. We’re sitting at an incredible time right now, and the opportunity for us as builders is to demonstrate how simple but powerful the modern home can be. Wi-Fi is the beginning of that for us" The first homes will be for sale in July, with a plan to roll out into all of the company's markets by the end of the year.

Company profile


Corporate

We are a national homebuilder that operates in various states with deliveries of 26,563 new homes in fiscal 2016. Our company was founded as a local Miami homebuilder in 1954. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. During the 1980s and 1990s, we entered and expanded operations in a number of homebuilding markets, including California, Florida and Texas, through both organic growth and acquisitions, such as Pacific Greystone Corporation in 1997. In 1997, we completed the spin-off of our then commercial real estate business, LNR Property Corporation. In 2000, we acquired U.S. Home Corporation, which expanded our operations into New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado and strengthened our position in other states. From 2002 through 2005, we acquired several regional homebuilders, which brought us into new markets and strengthened our position in several existing markets. From 2010 through 2013, we expanded our homebuilding operations into the Atlanta, Oregon, Seattle and Nashville markets.
Through the most recent economic downturn, we strengthened and expanded our competitive position through strategic purchases of land at favorable prices. We are currently focused on maintaining moderate growth in community count and homes sales, reducing selling, general and administrative expenses by using innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs, as well as on our soft-pivot land strategy, shortening the average time between when we acquire land and when we expect to begin building homes on it.


Homebuilding

Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. New home deliveries, including deliveries from unconsolidated entities, were 26,563 in fiscal 2016, compared to 24,292 in fiscal 2015 and 21,003 in fiscal 2014. We primarily sell single-family attached and detached homes in communities targeted to first-time homebuyers, move-up homebuyers and active adult homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home varies depending on product and geographic location. For fiscal 2016, the average sales price was $361,000, compared to $344,000 in fiscal 2015 and $326,000 in fiscal 2014.
We operate primarily under the Lennar brand name. Our homebuilding mission is focused on the profitable development of residential communities. Key elements of our strategy include:

Strong Operating Margins - We believe our operating leverage combined with our attractive land purchases position us for strong operating margins.
Everything’s Included® Approach - We are focused on distinguishing our products, including through our Everything’s Included® approach, which maximizes our purchasing power and enables us to include luxury features as standard items in our homes.
Innovative Homebuilding - We are constantly innovating the homes we build to create products that better meet our customers' needs and desires. Our Next Gen® home, or a home within a home, provides a unique new home solution for multi-generational households as homebuyers often need to accommodate children and parents to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses. In fiscal 2016, we delivered 1,186 Next Gen® homes representing an increase of 18% from the prior year and 4% of total home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. The average sales price of the Next Gen® homes delivered in fiscal 2016 was $461,000, which is 28% above the average sales price of total home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities.
Flexible Operating Structure - Our local operating structure gives us the flexibility to make operating decisions based on local homebuilding conditions and customer preferences, while our centralized management structure provides oversight for our homebuilding operations.




Financial Services

We offer conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other home mortgage products to buyers of our homes and others through our financial services subsidiary, Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, which includes Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, d/b/a Eagle Home Mortgage, from locations in most of the states in which we have homebuilding operations, as well as some other states. In fiscal 2016, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to 82% of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing in areas where we offered services.
We also provide title insurance and closing services to our homebuyers and others. During 2016, we provided title and closing services for approximately 116,000 real estate transactions, and issued approximately 298,900 title insurance policies through our underwriter, North American Title Insurance Company.


Rialto

The Rialto segment is a commercial real estate, investment management, and finance company. Rialto’s primary focus is to manage third-party capital and to originate commercial mortgage loans which it sells into securitizations. It also has invested its own capital in mortgage loans, properties and real estate related securities.


Multifamily

We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.
During the year ended November 30, 2016, our Lennar Multifamily segment continued to grow as a leading developer of apartment communities across the country with interests in 53 communities with development costs of approximately $4.8 billion, of which five communities were completed and operating, 13 communities were partially completed and leasing, 24 communities were under construction and the remaining communities were either owned or under contract. As of November 30, 2016, our Lennar Multifamily segment had a pipeline of future projects totaling $2.8 billion in assets across a number of states that will be developed primarily by unconsolidated entities.
