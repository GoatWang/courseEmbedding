Fee-Only & Fiduciary

The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is the country's leading association of fee-only and fiduciary financial planners.










What is Fee-Only Financial Planning and Why Does it Matter when Choosing an Advisor?
Every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job, however they don't all get paid the same way. A fee-only financial planner (all NAPFA advisors are fee-only) is paid directly by the client on a transparent and pre-arranged payment plan.  This can be an hourly or project rate, monthly retainer, or percentage of the investments managed.
Other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend. For example, if the planner sells you a specific investment, mutual fund, insurance or other products, they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company.
When working with a NAPFA Registered Financial Advisor, there are no hidden fees, commissions, third-party payments, or product sales.
If you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid, just ask them. It is not something that is easy to tell.
How a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients. Professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else, and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them. If that person is you, the client, then pleasing you will bring them long-term business. They will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have. A commission-based financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the client's best interest. That situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients.
Ultimately, you want to pick a planner who will be loyal to you and your interests. That planner is the fee-only planner.

Gold Coast Financial Planning specializes in providing objective financial planning to help clients build, manage, grow, and protect their assets through life's transitions.

About John Carrig
About Gold Coast Financial Planning





John Carrig, CFA®, CFP®,is the founding principal of Gold Coast Financial Planning, an independent financial planning and investment advisory firm. The firm provides fee-only financial planning services and investment advice to individuals and families from all walks of life and income levels.

As a Certified Financial Planner™ (CFP®) professional and Member of the Financial Planning Association (FPA), John is committed to championing the Six-Step Financial Planning Process as outlined by the CFP Board of Standards. He believes everyone can and should benefit from professional, unbiased financial planning and advice, not just those who are wealthy.
As a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®), John stands on years of analytical experience coupled with the rigorous education and examination in investment counseling and management, as proffered by the CFA Institute (formerly the Association for Investment Management and Research).
As a fee-only planner, John is committed to objectivity and independence. He works solely for his clients. He does not sell products nor does he receive any commissions or third-party referral fees. This allows clients to receive objective financial planning advice, without conflicts of interest regarding compensation.
As a Member of The Garrett Planning Network, Inc. (GPN), John is committed to providing objective, affordable advice to people from all walks of life and income levels. Services are offered on either an hourly-as-needed or ongoing retainer basis – whichever is more appropriate for the client. An estimate of fees is given to all clients before committing to any services.

John has been a part of the financial services industry for over thirty years, both in New York and London, U.K. He has served in various capacities including equity and fixed income trading, investment banking and global investor services. Prior to moving to Florida and establishing Gold Coast Financial Planning, he serviced Corporate and Public pension clients for JPMorgan as a portfolio valuation analyst.
For many years, family, friends and colleagues have been asking John’s advice about personal financial matters, including retirement choices, investment options in their 401(k) plans, employee benefit decisions, long-term care for their parents and first-time home buyer concerns. The satisfaction of helping others led John to providing advice to individuals and families on a private consulting basis for the past severalyears. Transitioning from a rewarding corporate career to personal financial planning has allowed John to fulfill two very important goals: Enjoy the comfortable lifestyle of the Florida coast and establish an independent financial planning practice.
To enhance his independent fee-only practice, John joined The Garrett Planning Network (GPN), a nationwide network of fee-only financial planners with a common goal: To provide professional, unbiased financial planning and advice to people from all walks of life. Other professional memberships include:

CFA Institute - formerly Association for Investment Management and Research
CFA Society of South Florida (CFASFL)
CFA Miami
National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA)
Financial Planning Association (FPA) – active in Broward County local chapter

Reasons to contact John:
1) His hourly-as-needed structure, allows people from all walks of life, regardless of their income levels, to receive the same type of quality, fee-only advice and professional financial planning services once available only to the affluent.
2) You will know what to expect and what it costs before committing for any services. Clients elect the level of service that’s right for them: hourly-as-needed or ongoing retainer services.
3) There are no hidden agendas or fees. All advice is rendered commission-free. There are no long-term contracts to sign, nor are you required to turn over your assets for management.
4) John has the experience, expertise and resources to meet your needs. From the most basic financial question to the most sophisticated financial plan, John’s 30 years of experience, targeted education and professional credentials give him uncommon depth and perspective on which to stand.
John offers a complimentary, no-obligation “Get Acquainted” meeting to determine if your needs and his services are a good match. If you live outside of the Gold Coast area, John would be happy to work with you “virtually” via email, the telephone and web conferences. Simply call or email John for an appointment.

    See all 3 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsSolid Brunner, who wrote very good sf for many years.ByCypherpunkon September 7, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseJohn Brunner wrote one of my all-time favorite sf stories, Times Without Number. I first read it as a teenager (maybe even pre-teen), and years later, I tracked it down and read it several more times. I see why I liked it as a teenager, but it was also a good novel, reading it as an adult. None of his novels have had revolutionary ideas, but all of them have several fully realized characters, enough detail and logic to make the world feel substantial, and characters do things that make sense. All of these seem like simple things, but it's surprising how often even very good novels can throw you out of the story by not doing these things well. Really, there is a limit to how much disbelief one can suspend. A few details here and there, or plot holes that zip by due to an otherwise well-written story are no big deal. Throw out a couple of things that make sense or just don't ring true, and do it at a crucial phase of a story, and it's over.The Avengers of Carrig is the first in a series, and it's the first novel of his that is squarely space opera, not a novel with an sf backstory or setup. The main characters are all well-written. One of the main characters is a woman, and women historically are weak characters in sf. I don't think that's the case. She's a career woman from a soft, Earth (center of the empire) background, and everyone, including her, is wondering if she can make it as a secret agent. She's clearly smart enough, but she can't get along with any of her co-workers, and her superiors can't figure out what to do with her. Other main characters are people who live in a backward society on a planet that has lost contact with their version of the federation. Smugglers and pirates have moved in and are trying to use the locals as slaves to mine radioactive or toxic ore.Like every Brunner novel that I've read, description is direct and to the point. Characters are reflective and have serious problems, but they don't dwell on those problems for entire chapters. His characters do things. He has an economical writing style that reminds me of Asimov, Clarke, and Dick. Where Asimov and Clarke often focus more on the ideas, and Dick gets wrapped up in one person's reality, Brunner focuses on their humanity and their efforts to do the right thing, even in horrible situations.I agree with many who feel that Brunner is an unrecognized master, and this is the first of several novels that display his deft writing style and economical story-telling. I've avoided saying much about the actual novel, because I don't want to spoil it for others. If what I've said so far about the story sounds interesting, there's a very good chance you'll enjoy this novel.Just know that many of the 60s and 70s novels are collector's items these days, due to their cover art, and the often high quality of the stories. That's why the Kindle versions of these books are often higher: you can rarely find the originals for a few cents.0Comment|

It is derived from the  personal name Craig. Thus, Carrig is a  patronymic name, taken from the given name of the father or some other ancestor of the bearer. However, Carrig may also be of  local origin, referring to those who lived in or near the place called Carrick in  Ayrshire. Carrig Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Carrig was first found in  Ayrshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir �ir), formerly a county in the southwestern Strathclyde region of   Scotland, that today makes up the Council Areas of South, East, and North  Ayrshire, and were known as 'the men of Carrick'. Duncan de Carrick (died 1250) was made the Mormaer (Earl) of Carrick by Scottish King Alexander I in 1186. He was a direct ancestor Robert the Bruce (Robert I), King of the Scots 1274-1329.Carrig Spelling VariationsCarrig Spelling VariationsIn Medieval times, spelling and translation were not nearly so highly developed as today.

It is derived from the  personal name Craig. Thus, Carrig is a  patronymic name, taken from the given name of the father or some other ancestor of the bearer. However, Carrig may also be of  local origin, referring to those who lived in or near the place called Carrick in  Ayrshire. Carrig Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Carrig was first found in  Ayrshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir �ir), formerly a county in the southwestern Strathclyde region of   Scotland, that today makes up the Council Areas of South, East, and North  Ayrshire, and were known as 'the men of Carrick'. Duncan de Carrick (died 1250) was made the Mormaer (Earl) of Carrick by Scottish King Alexander I in 1186. He was a direct ancestor Robert the Bruce (Robert I), King of the Scots 1274-1329.Carrig Spelling VariationsCarrig Spelling VariationsIn Medieval times, spelling and translation were not nearly so highly developed as today. They were generally carried out according to the sound and intuition of the bearer. For that reason  spelling variations are extremely common among early Scottish names. Carrig has been spelled Carrick, Carick, Carich, Carrich, Karryck, Karrik, Karrick, Kerrich, Kerrick, Carrig, Carrigy, McCarrigy and many more.Carrig Early HistoryCarrig Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Carrig research.
