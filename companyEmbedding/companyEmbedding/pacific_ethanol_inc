This board is for fundamental and technical discussion about Pacific Ethnaol Inc., PEIX.    Business Summary per Yahoo Finance: Pacific Ethanol, Inc. produces and sells ethanol and its co-products in the western United States, primarily in California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho. It also provides transportation, storage, and delivery of ethanol through third-party service providers. Its co-products include wet distillers grains. The Company sells ethanol to gasoline refining and distribution companies, and wet distillers grains to dairy operators and animal feed distributors. Pacific Ethanol was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Sacramento, California.  The following information obtained from the Pacific Ethanol Inc. website: http://www.pacificethanol.net/  Latest News http://www.pacificethanol.net/site/index.php/news/   Driven by Demand™ Pacific Ethanol is a leader in producing and marketing low-carbon ethanol. Our destination model and state-of-the-art production practices allow us to produce ethanol that reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent compared to conventional gasoline. In addition, Pacific Ethanol is working to identify and develop other renewable fuel technologies, such as cellulose-based ethanol production and bio-diesel. In order to meet demand for low-carbon ethanol, Pacific Ethanol is constructing over 420 million gallons of capacity by 2010 in strategic locations across the West. Central to our growth strategy is our destination business model, whereby each respective ethanol plant achieves lower process and transportation costs by servicing local markets for both fuel and feed, providing us a strategic advantage in the marketplace.  Ethanol is a critical part of the country's energy future. As an alternative fuel or a fuel additive, it has many advantages. Ethanol is made from renewable resources, reducing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. Ethanol also helps consumers by increasing domestic fuel supplies and refining capacity. The Energy Bill passed by Congress in 2005 requires an increase in ethanol use by refiners to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012.    Right Place Right Time In order to meet the West Coast's current ethanol needs, Pacific Ethanol plans to construct over 420 million gallons of capacity in the next four years. Today Pacific Ethanol operates the largest ethanol plant on the West Coast and has broken ground on several cutting-edge, strategically located production plants. http://www.pacificethanol.net/site/index.php/about/facilities/   Kinergy Marketing is the ethanol sales and distribution arm of Pacific Ethanol, Inc. Formerly an independent company founded by PEI's Neil Koehler, Kinergy continues to build on a strong customer base of major and unbranded oil companies. Since the demand for ethanol in the Western United States exceeds the production capacity of existing and proposed ethanol plants in the region, Kinergy will continue to sell ethanol produced in the Midwest in addition to Pacific Ethanol's own production. Our expertise in transportation logistics and emphasis on superior service has led to close relationships with both suppliers and customers. Driven by the increasing demand for ethanol as well as the growing reputation of the company, Kinergy's market area now includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado and Texas, with continuing expansion planned.  Ethanol Supply and Marketing Contact Information: Greg DiBiase, VP of Ethanol Supply and Marketing Phone: 916-403-2128 Email: gdibiase@kinergymarketing.com  Ethanol Sales Contact Information: Darren Knop, Director of Ethanol Sales and Marketing Phone: 916-403-2177 Email: dknop@pacificethanol.net   In the ethanol production process, after a grain's starch is converted to ethanol through fermentation, the remaining nutrients, including proteins, fats, fiber, minerals and vitamins, are concentrated into what is called wet distillers grain (WDG). WDG is a very palatable, medium-protein feed for dairy cattle, beef cattle, poultry, and swine. Its high digestibility and energy content yield greater milk production and better feed conversions than other feeds. Beef cattle have shown faster and more efficient weight gains due to its digestibility, energy content, and palatability.  In the United States, most distillers grains are produced in the Midwest, where producers dry the grains for shipping. Typically, dried distillers grains have a lower nutritional content than WDG. Pacific Ethanol is uniquely able to provide farmers with wet distillers grains because of our central locations in the heart of the livestock industry, where there are more than enough head of livestock in a 50-mile radius to consume all the WDG we can produce every day.  Our distillers grain has the added advantage of being produced from just one type of grain, as opposed to many of the Midwest distillers grains, which are made from corn, milo, barley, or wheat, depending on availability and pricing of competing crops. This means that the nutrient content of our WDG is predictable and consistent. This is particularly important for livestock producers, where a subtle difference in the makeup of key feed ingredients can significantly affect production.   Pacific Ag Products is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Pacific Ethanol that handles the marketing and distribution of grain products for the Company. Corn receiving and grain mill operations at Front Range Energy in Windsor, Colorado as well as all Pacific Ethanol plants are handled by Pacific Ag Products. This subsidiary is also responsible for marketing all WDG produced by our plants and Front Range Energy.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
