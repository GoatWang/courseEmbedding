Detailed item info
DescriptionWhether grow-your-own, bought locally from a farmer's market, or fresh from an ordinary supermarket, the seasons still affect the quality, abundance and price of good food. It just makes sense to preserve food quality for those times when it's t as plentiful or t available at all. Dehydrating food with this terrific book is easy and creates tasty food year-round. Incorporating the age-old practices of food dehydration takes full advantage of what nature offers. All the wonderful recipes are still here and there is a bonus section on everything from pet treats to crafts and homemade gifts. What has changed is that the 'Everything You Need to Kw About Dehydrating Foods' section has been expanded to include even more comprehensive and complete information about dehydrating foods along with even more tips and techniques. There are more than 150 recipes for dehydrating everything from herbs and seasonings to fruits, vegetables, meats and fish. Plus more than 250 delicious recipes actually use the dehydrated foods as ingredients, putting home-preserved food to work for home, caravan, boat or campsite.  The easy-to-follow drying instructions along with time guidelines make even a vice cook feel like a seasoned professional. Planting a few extra rows of tomatoes or beans, picking many strawberries at their peak or buying that big basket of freshly harvested carrots can really pay off later. Loading up the dehydrator will provide personally dried foods the whole year through.Key FeaturesAuthor(s)Don Mercer, Jay Nutt, Jennifer MackenziePublisherRobert Rose IncDate of Publication28/05/2009LanguageEnglishFormatPaperbackISBN-100778802132ISBN-139780778802136SubjectFood & Drink: GeneralPublication DataCountry of PublicationCanadaImprintRobert Rose IncContent Note16 full colour platesDimensionsWeight816 gWidth178 mmHeight255 mmSpine28 mmDescriptionAuthor BiographyJennifer MacKenzie is a professional home economist, cookbook author and recipe developer.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Dehydrator Bibleby Mackenzie, Jennifer/ Nutt, Jay/ Mercer, DonA new update of the bestselling book in its field -- 100,000 in print.Whether grow-your-own, bought locally from a farmer's market, or fresh from a regular supermarket, seasonality still affects the quality, abundance and price of good food. It just makes sense to preserve food quality for those times when it's not as plentiful or not available at all. Dehydrating food with this terrific book is easy and creates tasty food year-round.Incorporating the age-old practices of food dehydration takes full advantage of what nature offers. All the wonderful recipes are still here and there is a bonus section on everything from pet treats to crafts and homemade gifts. What has changed is that the &quot;Everything You Need to Know About Dehydrating Foods&quot; section has been expanded to include even more comprehensive and complete information about dehydrating foods along with even more tips and techniques.There are more than 150 recipes for dehydrating everything from herbs and seasonings to fruits, vegetables, meats and fish, plus more than 250 delicious recipes that actually use the dehydrated foods as ingredients. Putting home-preserved food to work for home, RV, boat or campsite has never been easier. The easy-to-follow drying instructions along with time guidelines make even a novice cook feel like a seasoned professional.Planting a few extra rows of tomatoes or beans, picking many strawberries at their peak or buying that big basket of freshly harvested carrots can really pay off later. Loading up the dehydrator will provide personally dried foods the whole year through.Special AppliancesCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Exactly what I wanted!

Funny to read the only other review! Exactly the reason I purchased this cookbook, for the recipes!! There are other cookbooks etc out there to instruct on the actual dehydrating more in depth. but this cookbook has a decent blend and a lot of recipes. Would definitely recommend for someone who already has some experience with dehydrating.

Exactly what I wanted!

Funny to read the only other review! Exactly the reason I purchased this cookbook, for the recipes!! There are other cookbooks etc out there to instruct on the actual dehydrating more in depth. but this cookbook has a decent blend and a lot of recipes. Would definitely recommend for someone who already has some experience with dehydrating.

Wasted $$$

Waste of money!  More recipes on what to do with dehydrated foods than ways to dehydrate!
