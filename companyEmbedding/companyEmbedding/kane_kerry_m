Love this dress!!!Review by fran 






Quality








                                                                I love this dress.  I love all of my Karen Kane clothing, especially the dresses.  Karen Kane clothing fits well, looks good, items are comfortable to wear.  I always get compliments on all of my Karen Kane items.  Compliments from men and women.  I am so thrilled I discovered this line of clothing.                                (Posted on 6/16/15)
