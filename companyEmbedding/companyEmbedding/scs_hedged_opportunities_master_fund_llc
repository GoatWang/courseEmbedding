Liquid alts offer FoHF industry new avenues for branding and asset growth


					December 05, 2014

					 
                    
				

					Investor choice widens as fund of hedge funds firms continue to launch retail-focused RIC and ’40 Act product offerings, enabling them to access new pools of investment capital
				




Click here for: 'The new industry mantra: liquidity,
    liquidity, liquidity'

By Siobhán Hallissey



 



 





    Open-ended liquid alternatives have overshadowed their
    closed-end siblings over the last few years as the liquid
    alternatives industry continues to grow both in terms of assets
    and number. This is not a surprise as a growing majority in the
    hedge fund industry see the rise of mutual fund offerings as a
    trend that is still in its infancy. 

    

For a growing number of retail shoppers, the daily liquidity
    fund of hedge funds (FoHF) industry now comprises 32 funds,
    which manage close to $10 billion compared to the eight funds
    that managed just over $3 billion this time last year.
The majority of the firms that have entered the open-ended
    market so far are Billion Dollar Club firms, with Permal Asset
    Management, Abbey Capital and Rothschild and Larch Lane among
    the new entrants over the course of the last 12 months (
    click here for table).
However closed-end RICs registered with the SEC under the
    1940 Act, which are generally aimed at the high-net worth
    market, have also experienced growth. The industry grew by 24%
    in the 12-month period to 31 March 2014 to manage $23 billion,
    as funds of hedge funds continued to deploy hedge fund
    strategies within a regulated framework in order to reach a
    broader investor base. When combined, open-ended and closed-end
    RICs total $33 billion (see table, right).
The 24% growth and median return of 7.78% over the same
    12-month period suggest that the industry is continuing to gain
    momentum and that the landscape is still developing in terms of
    breadth and diversification.
However, the total asset growth rate does not appear to be
    representative of the entire industry, as the divergence
    between the individual RICs’ asset growth ranged
    from 216% on the positive side to -52% at the other end of the
    spectrum. All of the RICs achieved positive returns over the
    period, but 40% of the funds saw outflows – despite
    making high returns in a number of cases. The median growth
    rate of the industry was 4.70%, compared to -7.45% in the
    previous year, and this figure provides an alternative
    indication of the growth of the closed-end 1940 Act FoHFs.
The industry grew despite the total number of RICs falling
    to 88 compared to 93 in the previous year. Existing RICs were
    the main contributors to the growth rate and the funds with the
    largest asset growth grew by over 100%.



 



 
Ray Nolte



    There were five new master funds launched over the 12-month
    period, including the second offering from SkyBridge Capital,
    and the first products from Steben & Co and Pine Grove
    Asset Management. Of the 88 RICs listed in the 
    table of SEC registered FoHFs, 51 are master funds while
    the remaining 37 are feeder funds that differ from the master
    fund in terms of fees and tax structures depending on the
    investor. Tax-exempt investors in the US for example, would
    utilise a tax-exempt feeder such as a TEI fund that feeds into
    the master fund. The underlying hedge fund portfolios of the
    feeder funds are managed at the master fund level and, as such,
    the total asset figure includes the assets of the master funds
    only to avoid double counting. The expenses and return of the
    feeder funds are included in the table to present the
    differences that occur across the master and feeder tranches. 

    

SkyBridge Capital manages the largest of the closed-end RICs
    and half of its total assets invested in hedge funds –
    which stood at $11 billion at the mid-year point, according to
    the InvestHedge Billion Dollar Club survey – are
    invested via these structures.
The largest of the RICs, SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund
    Portfolios, had $5.58 billion in assets to the end of March,
    following a growth rate of 57% over the 12-month period
    compared to the fund’s return of 12%. The fund is
    also one of the oldest RICs, with an official launch date of
    2002, under the Citi brand. The 2010 deal with Citi brought in
    the RIC offering and an investment team led by Ray Nolte.
Perhaps helping to further boost the brand is the
    star-studded SkyBridge Alternatives (SALT) conference held
    annually in Las Vegas since 2009. Also as an independent firm,
    SkyBridge has historically had access to multiple distribution
    platforms including Merrill Lynch, UBS, Wells Fargo and Raymond
    James among others (
    InvestHedge, October 2013).
"The growth in the asset flow has come from a very broad
    base, both from the individual side and institutions," explains
    Nolte, managing partner and chief investment officer at
    SkyBridge. "The biggest positive of the RICs structure comes
    when dealing with individual investors such as accredited and
    high-net worth investors, as it allows for 1099 tax reporting.
    This makes it simple for our clients to report their taxes in
    time for the April deadline and we set up RICs to ensure we
    could offer that."
He adds: "The registered nature of the product has also been
    helpful in the growth of the fund, as there is a greater
    comfort level for both individuals and institutions as we
    report the fund’s positions and holdings with the
    SEC every quarter."
SkyBridge launched its second RIC, the SkyBridge G II Fund
    in January of this year largely to meet investor demands, which
    came from US Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) in
    particular. RIAs generally manage their client’s
    entire portfolio that would most likely include equities, bonds
    and alternatives.
Nolte says: "Investors liked all the attributes of a
    registered 1099 product but required a more diversified product
    than the SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios.
    Investors were saying 'We really like the fund and the
    tactical, dynamic and high conviction nature of how you
    allocate to your chosen themes, can we get the process in
    slightly more diversified fashion?’ Therefore the
    SkyBridge G II Fund offers more diversification at the strategy
    and manager level and we tilt the portfolio based on our
    thematic point of view."
The new fund had $26.5 million in assets as of March 2014
    invested across three categories that include event driven
    (55%), directional equity (16%) and relative value (28%). By
    comparison SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
    allocation to event driven was much higher at 67% and the
    allocation to equity was much lower at 5%, while relative value
    was slightly lower at 25%. Overlapping names in both SkyBridge
    portfolios includes the Jana Nirvana Fund, with a little over
    6% allocation in each programme. The Trian Partners Fund,
    Paulson Recovery Fund and the York Select Fund also feature in
    the event-driven section of both portfolios.
While the SkyBridge offerings are the largest in our survey,
    the AllianceBernstein Multi-Manager Alternative Fund was the
    master RIC with the highest growth rate at 216%. The fund
    launched in October 2012 and during the reporting period
    surpassed its first year anniversary, which can often result in
    a pick-up in assets as potential investors often like to see at
    least a 12-month track record. The assets grew from $311
    million in March 2013 to $981 million by March 2014.
The AllianceBernstein fund was up by 8.04% for the period,
    investing in five strategies that included allocations to
    long/short equity, event driven, credit and distressed, global
    macro and emerging markets. The manager with the largest
    allocation was the Canyon Balanced Fund at 3.2%, while Fir Tree
    International Value Fund followed with 3.1%. The strong growth
    has continued over the course of 2014 and as of 30 September,
    the fund’s assets stood at $1.23 billion.
Asset inflows uneven, focused on brand names
All of the funds that saw inflows of over 100% had
    accumulated either a one or two-year track record during the
    reporting period and may have benefited from being able to
    present this to potential investors.
In terms of growth rate, Blackstone Alternative Asset
    Management followed closely behind AllianceBernstein, which
    launched its closed-end RIC the Blackstone Alternative Alpha
    Master Fund six months earlier in April 2012.
Recently, Blackstone signed a letter of intent with mutual
    fund shop Columbia Management to research and develop
    investment solutions that leverage Columbia’s
    asset management capabilities and Blackstone’s
    hedge fund solutions business. The addition of
    Blackstone’s alternative investment proficiency as
    captured through existing registered fund solutions will
    further enhance Columbia’s capability set,
    according to officials.
The Blackstone Alternative Alpha Master Fund grew by 172%
    with assets totalling $533 million at the end of March with a
    return of 8.98%. The Blackstone portfolio invests in Pershing
    Square, Jana Nirvana Fund, Tudor BVI Global Fund and Elliott
    International.
The Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund and the JP
    Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund II both grew by over 100%
    over the course of the year. Common names among both RICs
    included DE Shaw Composite International Fund, OZ Overseas Fund
    and Perry Partners International.
The Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund has seen its
    assets grow substantially since its January 2011 launch. The
    assets grew by 254% in its first full year, and by 243% in its
    second year with a further 163% growth rate over the 12 month
    period to April 2014. The portfolio turnover was 17.74%
    compared to 8.67% in the previous year and the new additions to
    the portfolio were mainly managers that offered greater
    liquidity. In the relative value multi-strategy category a
    manager that offered annual liquidity was redeemed while a new
    allocation was made to the Citadel Kensington Global Strategies
    Fund that offers quarterly liquidity. Furthermore in the
    market-neutral and hedged equity category, two managers with
    quarter liquidity terms were removed while the new manager
    offered monthly liquidity. The fund returned 9% during the
    reporting period compared to 10% in the previous year.
Of the master RICs listed in the table, more than half (59%)
    saw inflows and the assets of 85% of those funds increased by
    over 10%, outweighing the returns for the majority of the
    funds.
The 10 master RICs with the highest growth rate all grew by
    over 50% and four of the RICs saw inflows of over 100%. A
    minority of RICs were either flat or experienced outflows.
    Close to a third of the master RICs saw outflows of over 10%,
    highlighting the discrepancies that have occurred in the asset
    growth of the industry.
Examples include the ACP Strategic Opportunities Fund that
    saw outflows of close to 39% despite returning 13% over the 12
    months to December 2013. The firm, which recently approved a
    proposed investment advisory relationship with Barlow Partners,
    focuses on smaller and more flexible hedge fund managers
    – with the underlying managers including Consector
    Partners and Cooper Creek Partners. Likewise the SCS Hedged
    Opportunities Fund was up by over 10% but saw its assets drop
    by over 16%.
RIC returns average 8.17%, equity
    dominates
    RICs outperformed the InvestHedge Composite Index on both a
    median and average basis for the 12-month period to March 2014.
    While the composite gained 5.90% on a median basis and 5.61% on
    an average basis, the median RICs performance was 7.78% and
    average performance was 8.17%. The RICs also outperformed the
    HedgeFund Intelligence Composite, which represents the
    performance of single-manager hedge funds globally, on both a
    median and a mean average basis.
All of the RICs achieved positive returns of over 1.4%,
    while more than a quarter achieved double-digit returns. Morgan
    Creek Capital Management’s Global Equity/Long
    Short Master Fund was the leading performer with a return of
    25%. The $69 million fund has adopted a multi-asset investment
    portfolio with 18% of the assets invested directly in
    securities, which may account for the high return, and 70%
    invested in underlying portfolio funds.
The fund also had one of the highest portfolio turnovers at
    72% and overall 10 funds were removed from the portfolio,
    including both of the emerging markets managers, which
    accounted for 4.6% of the portfolio in March 2013 and included
    an allocation to The Russian Prosperity Fund.
A number of the high performers had large allocations to
    equity hedged strategies, which helped to drive the returns.
    Equity strategies were strong performers over the time period,
    and the S&P 500 was up by 22% while the HedgeFund
    Intelligence Equity Index was also up by over 12%. The A&Q
    Long/Short Strategies fund – formerly named
    O’Connor Fund of Funds: Long/Short Strategies
    – returned 16.87% for the 12-month period to December
    2013, although the assets fell by 6.40% despite the high
    return.
Compared to the other RICs the A&Q Long/Short Strategies
    Fund had a relatively low portfolio turnover at 5.34%, Brevan
    Howard and Meditor European Hedge Fund were two of the four
    funds in the portfolio that offered monthly liquidity but both
    funds have been redeemed since December 2012, along with
    Anthion Partners and Pershing Square. Two of the
    funds’ underlying funds now provide monthly
    liquidity with the remainder offering quarterly or semi-annual
    liquidity.
Another of UBS Alternative & Quantitative
    Investments’ RICs was a high performer –
    the A&Q Technology fund, which returned 16.76% –
    while the Morgan Stanley Global Long/Short Fund A followed
    closely behind with a return of 16.44% for the period to the
    December. The Visium Balanced Fund was one underlying manager
    listed in both RICs portfolios, being one of the largest of the
    A&Q Technology Fund’s holdings at 10.89%.
The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund was
    up by 12% for the year ending January 2014, outperforming the
    InvestHedge Distressed Index by 3%. Due to the less liquid
    nature of the strategy the majority of the underlying funds
    offer annual or semi-annual liquidity. The Morgan Stanley
    Institutional Fund of Hedge Funds, Alternative Investment
    Partners Absolute Return Fund and Mellon Optima L/S Strategy
    Fund were also up by over 10%.
New RIC launches broaden the
    landscape
    Altogether there were five new RICs launched over the reporting
    period that contributed $256 million to the overall asset
    total.
The A&Q Master Fund, formerly named
    O’Connor Funds of Funds Master, launched on 1 July
    2013, UBS Alternative & Quantitative Investments renamed
    all of their RICs over the course of 2014 from
    O’Connor Funds of Funds to A&Q. The A&Q
    Master Fund classified its investments into three categories
    including equity hedged, an 85% slice of the assets at the end
    of March 2014, with the largest allocation to Viking Global
    Equities III at 7.1%, while Bronson Point Partners and Pennant
    Windward Fund both made up 7.01% of the $107 million fund.
The Steben Select Multi-Strategy Master Fund launched in
    August 2013 and had the strongest return of the new entrants,
    up by 9% to the end of March. The portfolio was employed across
    five strategies, and like the A&Q Masters fund allocated
    the largest slice to equity long/short, which stood at 36% of
    the total investment portfolio, followed by global macro with
    21%, equity market-neutral at 18%, fixed-income relative value
    at 15% and multi-strategy at 10%.
Pine Grove Asset Management, which was acquired by Man Group
    earlier this year, also entered the closed-end space with the
    launch of the Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund in
    January. Pine Grove took deliberate steps to convert a private
    unregistered fund into a registered ’40 Act fund
    format.
"Since the Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund
    acquired the assets of its predecessor fund, it will be one of
    the only ’40 Act funds that benefits from a
    16-year performance history," explains Matthew Stadtmauer,
    president of Pine Grove Asset Management.
The portfolio’s largest allocations were to
    credit and distressed strategies, hedged credit accounted for
    29% of the $58 million assets in the fund, with the largest
    allocations going to Anchorage Capital Partners and Fir Tree
    Capital Opportunity Fund. "Our portfolio construction is
    positioned to handle a potential rise in interest rates as the
    managers we allocate to usually display negative correlation to
    high quality bonds," explains Tom Williams, chief investment
    officer of Pine Grove Asset Management.
Other brand-name multi-manager firms actively launching
    offerings include Permal. The Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio
    was launched on 12 June 2013 and Permal Hedge Fund Strategies
    I, which launched in February 2012, began investing as a feeder
    fund in Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio along with Permal
    Hedge Strategies Fund II that launched on the 28 June 2013.
Similar to the SkyBridge portfolios, the Permal Hedge
    Strategies Portfolio invests in Trian Partners as well as funds
    managed by York Capital Management and Paulson & Co, with
    allocations to the Paulson Credit Opportunities and York
    Investments funds. The fund invests the majority of the assets
    in fixed-income hedge strategies, which stood at 31% at the end
    of March and the strategy was the leading contributor to the
    year-over-year performance. The Permal Hedge Strategies
    Portfolio returned 5% between June 2013 and March 2014 while
    the Permal Hedge Fund Strategies I was up by 9% for the full
    year.
A newer launch that missed the cut-off in our earlier survey
    is the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund, which launched
    over the summer and has gathered an additional $27 million for
    Evanston Capital Management. Evanston was founded in 2002 by
    David Wagner, who was formerly the vice president and chief
    investment officer at Northwestern University in Evanston,
    Illinois.
Overall number of RICs falls, fund turnover
    rises
    The total number of RICs fell as 16 funds left the rankings
    including two of the oldest RICs, the Advantage Advisers
    Whistler Fund advised by Oppenheimer Asset Management that
    launched in July 1999 and the Lazard Alternative Strategies
    Fund, which launched in September 2001.
In November 2013, the board of managers approved a plan of
    liquidation for the Advantage Advisers Whistler Fund to
    terminate its operations and liquidate at the end of 2013. At
    the same time the Lazard Alternative Strategies Fund was
    reorganised into the Lazard Alternative Strategies 1099
    Fund.
As a result of the reorganisation, the Lazard Alternative
    Strategies 1099 Fund acquired all the net assets of the Lazard
    Alternative Strategies Fund, accounting for the 99.89% growth
    rate of the Lazard Alternative Strategies 1099 Fund, which had
    $99 million in assets at the end of March 2014 compared to $50
    million in March 2013.
The Blue Rock Market Neutral Fund, Old Field Master Fund,
    Cantor Opportunistic Alternatives Fund, Multi-Manager Master
    Portfolio advised by GenSpring Family Offices and the BlackRock
    Alternatives Allocation Master Portfolio are the other funds
    that are no longer listed in the table as a result of
    liquidations and mergers.
The GMAM Absolute Return Strategies Fund I, managed by
    General Motors Investment Management, is also no longer listed
    in the table. The $5 billion RIC, which was previously listed
    in the rankings, grew by 10.05% in the year to March 2014 but
    has been removed from this year’s table as 
    the company uses the RIC structure to manage the pension
    fund’s hedge fund allocation and does not accept
    outside investment. The total RIC asset figure for March 2013
    has been readjusted to reflect this so as to ensure that the
    correct asset growth has been calculated.
The portfolio turnover of the RICs was higher than in the
    previous two years on both an average and median basis. The
    average portfolio turnover was 57% for the period to March 2014
    compared to 24% the previous year; however the 170% turnover
    figure for the Gottex Multi-Asset Endowment Master Fund, which
    invests in common stocks, ETFs and mutual funds as well as
    hedge funds, was the main contributor to this high figure. The
    median figure portfolio turnover was 20.58%, only slightly
    above the median portfolio turnover of 20.04% in the previous
    year.
The A&Q Multi-Strategy Fund had the second highest
    portfolio turnover at 74% as the equity hedged allocation was
    increased from 25% in the previous year to 37% to March 2014.
    The largest allocations in the equity hedged category went to
    two new managers, the Tiger Eye Fund and Shellback Offshore
    Fund. The portfolio turnover of the CPG JPMorgan Alternative
    Strategies Fund was also over 50%, despite only having seven
    underlying managers. Davidson Kempner and Double Black Diamond
    were redeemed over the period and were replaced by Atlas Global
    and Citadel Kensington Global Strategies Fund.
The RICs offer an insight into the investing trends of FoHFs
    as they share a number of common holdings and it is interesting
    to see the disparity in the categorisation of the funds across
    the different advisers. For instance King Street Capital,
    Silver Point Capital and Anchorage Capital Partners were among
    the most featured funds, but all three funds were categorised
    across the distressed, credit or event-driven allocations
    depending on the RIC portfolio. All three of these funds were
    listed in the portfolios of the $511 million Aetos Capital
    Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, the $503 million
    Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund and the new
    Pine Grove Alternative Institutional Fund.
Likewise with Eton Park, the fund is listed as a manager in
    a number of the RICs but the fund’s categorisation
    in the various portfolios ranges across multi-strategy, event
    driven and arbitrage.
Pelham Long/Short features in the equity allocations of nine
    of the portfolios, while Blue Trend is listed in either the
    managed futures or macro allocations of eight RICs. Both hedge
    funds featured in the $461 million Morgan Stanley Institutional
    Fund of Hedge Funds RIC and offered monthly liquidity.
Another manager in the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund of
    Hedge Funds RIC is the Magnetar Capital Fund, which appears in
    seven of the RIC portfolios including the $600 million
    Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund.
Other Magnetar funds that contributed to the 11% return of
    the Alternative Investment Partners Absolute Return Fund
    portfolio include the Magnetar Equity Opportunities Fund and
    the Magnetar Global Event Driven Fund.
Luxor Capital Partners, Tybourne Equity, Trient Global Macro
    and Monarch Debt Recovery Fund all featured in six of the RIC
    portfolios, and all the funds were listed among the underlying
    managers of the $78 million ASGI Aurora Opportunities Fund.
    Corvex Partners and Senator Global Opportunity Fund also had
    investments from over six of the RICs. Both funds contributed
    to the 10% return of the $482 million NT Alpha Strategies Fund,
    along with the Trient Global Macro Fund.
Wide range of fees and fee structures
Fee structure is an important differentiating factor
    between hedge funds and mutual funds. The total expense ratio
    is the figure that investors need to consider in the mutual
    fund industry, compared to the management and performance fees
    that are generally utilised by the hedge fund industry. The
    expense ratio of the RICs in the table ranges from 2.82% at the
    highest end of the spectrum to 0.10% at the lowest, with the
    median expense ratio figure at 1.99%.
Of those master RICs that have an associated feeder fund,
    the feeder funds generally have higher expense ratios as these
    facilitate certain investor types. The TEI feeder funds appear
    to have the highest expense ratios as the Hatteras Core
    Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, The Endowment TEI Fund and
    the Rochdale High Yield Alternative Strategies Fund TEI all
    have expense ratios of over 2%.
Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional
    Fund’s expense ratio was 2.73%, more than double
    the 1.32% of the Hatteras Master Fund. On the other hand the
    difference between the Rochdale High Yield Alternative
    Strategies Fund TEI expense ratio of 2.25% and the Master Fund
    at 2.14% is significantly lower.
The expense ratio of the Arden Sage Multi-Strategy TEI
    Institutional Fund is the lowest of the TEI feeder funds at
    1.32%, with a return of 9%. Arden’s RIC, was
    invested across seven strategies including equity event,
    multi-event driven and credit event. The largest holding was to
    Lakewood Capital Partners, which accounted for 9% of
    members’ capital.
The lowest fee among the RICs is with one of the feeder
    funds offered by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, which
    with nearly $60 billion in overall assets is the largest fund
    of hedge funds group in the world. The latest RIC fund in the
    Blackstone stable was launched in 2013 and has approximately $9
    million in assets and charges 0.1% to underlying investors, who
    have seen an annualised gain of 7.59%.
As investors look to alternatives to diversify their
    portfolios, the hedge fund investing industry is continuing to
    look at ways of diversifying the investor base by offering
    products in differing structures.
Looking at the registration filings, EnTrust Partners
    appears to be ready to enter this market by offering a
    registered product for their investors without constraints.
The closed-end RIC remains a useful tool to achieve those
    business development aims. Unlike their open-ended
    counterparts, the closed-end RIC structure allows FoHFs to
    access a much wider investor base without compromising
    returns.

Income Taxes
The Master Fund’s tax year end is December 31.  The Master Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.  Each shareholder is responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to such member’s distributive share of taxable income or loss.  Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements.


The Master Fund is subject to authoritative guidance related to the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under U.S. GAAP.  This guidance sets forth a minimum threshold for the financial statement recognition of tax positions takes based on the technical merits of such positions.  Management is not aware of any exposure to uncertain tax positions that could require accrual.  As of December 31, 2015, the Master Fund’s tax years since inception remain open and subject to examination by relevant taxing authorities.


Investment Valuation
The Master Fund primarily invests in private Portfolio Funds that are not listed on a securities exchange. Prior to investing in any Portfolio Fund, the Adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the Portfolio Fund.


The Master Fund’s valuation procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information
available at the time the Master Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by a Portfolio Fund manager does not represent the fair value of the Master Fund’s interests in that Portfolio Fund. Although redemptions of interests in Portfolio Funds are subject to advance notice requirements, Portfolio Funds typically will make available net asset value information to holders representing the price at which, even in the absence of redemption activity, a Portfolio Fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if, in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Fund’s governing documents, it would be necessary to effect a mandatory redemption. Following procedures adopted by the Board, in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular Portfolio Fund, the Master Fund would consider
whether it was appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to net asset value. For example, when a Portfolio Fund imposes extraordinary restrictions on redemptions, or when there have been no recent transactions in Portfolio Fund interests, the Adviser may determine that it is appropriate to apply such a discount. Any such decision would be made in good faith, and subject to the review and supervision of the Board.
The Adviser assesses the accuracy of each Portfolio Fund’s reported monthly net asset value using various means. These may include comparing a reported valuation with one or more strategy-specific benchmarks that the Adviser believes correlate with the strategy of the Portfolio Fund; discussing the performance of the Portfolio Fund with the manager’s personnel; or reviewing and analyzing the Portfolio Fund’s audited financial statements.
The valuations reported by the Portfolio Funds’ managers, upon which the Master Fund calculates its month-end net asset value and net asset value per share may be subject to later adjustment, based on information reasonably available at that time. For example, fiscal year-end net asset value calculations of the Portfolio Funds are audited by those Portfolio Funds’ independent public accountants, during their respective fiscal year end, and may be revised as a result of such audits.  Other adjustments may occur from time to time. To the extent these adjustments materially impact the Master Fund’s net asset value, management will appropriately adjust participants’ transactions to ensure they are not materially harmed.


Short term investments are valued at closing net asset value.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Master Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.
Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).
Level 3 — Valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant.
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
As of December 31, 2015, short term investments valued at $1,180,203 are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Investment companies that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investment companies at December 31, 2015 is $33,076,709.
During the period ended December 31, 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.











Item 2. Controls and Procedures.




(a)


The Registrant’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)) (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)) are effective as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(b)) and Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d‑15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(d)).










(b)


There were no changes in the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the Registrant's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.








Item 3. Exhibits.
Separate certifications for each principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)).  Filed herewith.

SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC  Shareholder Letter  November 29, 2011 
   
  Dear Investors,  The SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) returned an estimated 0.56% net of all fees and expenses inception to date through September 30, 2011. 
SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) is a multi-strategy fund of hedge funds launched on September 1, 2010. The Fund employs global
research to identify and analyze both established and emerging hedge fund managers. The Fund’s objective is to preserve and grow capital by producing attractive, long-term capital appreciation with reduced volatility and lower correlation
relative to the equity markets. The Fund seeks to achieve strong performance relative to its peers or applicable indices through an intensive manager selection process, while risk is managed through thoughtful portfolio construction and
diversification across strategies, geographies and sectors. The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC (the “Master Fund”). The Master Fund pursues the same investment objective as the
Fund. Both the Fund and the Master Fund are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-diversified closed-end management investment companies.  The third quarter market adjustments were likely due in Q4 2010, but delayed by last year’s QE2 operations. As a whole, 2011 played out in a very similar fashion to 2010, with one major exception: global
financial liquidity fell significantly and was not offset by central banks in any of the three major economic regions of Asia, North America or Europe. That was a warning sign that results this quarter might reveal the weakest links in the
financial system. To explain: a series of global events in each region over the last three quarters combined to squeeze global liquidity. These
events began last fall and gathered momentum and strength over the course of 2011. It started in Asia with China’s tightening measures to fight domestic inflation pressures last fall. Europe’s “inflation-phobes” introduced a
double-whammy of monetary and fiscal tightening at the same time by raising short-term rates for the first time since 2008 while the politicians demanded austerity to balance budgets of near bankrupt governments of southern Europe. In the meantime,
during much of 2011 U.S. politicians wrangled over the debt ceiling and proposed fiscal cuts and higher taxes instead of more quantitative easing. And the list goes on. Subsequently, the United States went into a current account surplus (ex-China, ex-oil), with US dollars coming home, as opposed to circulating through international trade and international banking systems, thus
confirming the draining of liquidity abroad.  All of these factors led us to bring in portfolio risk in areas most sensitive to a withdrawal of liquidity
(Europe, credit and emerging markets). We still lost money for the quarter, as our higher volatility managers, which we use for up-market capture, reinforced that they are good for down-market capture as well. The good news is that our expectation
for these managers fell into our range of expected outcomes, and we believe that their portfolio investments still offer the potential for attractive future returns.  Our goal throughout this crisis period is the same as it was 2008: protect capital while generating reasonable returns, so that we can buy cheap assets in chaos, without limiting upside in a normal market
environment. Easier to say than to implement, but it can be done. That is the magic of good hedge fund investing. Let us break apart our portfolio in those segments and highlight some of the techniques we use to do this. 
  1 


Table of Contents
“Protect capital while generating reasonable returns.” 
Technique: allocate to “all-weather” managers who we believe, regardless of the markets, will have the potential to generate solid returns. Our relative
value suite and low net, moderate gross exposure long/short equity managers serve as the primary examples. Year to date, our relative value suite has gained over 3% and our low-net long short managers are performing well. These managers are the
equivalent of a baseball player with great on-base-percentage.  “Buy cheap assets in chaos.” 
Technique: allocate to opportunistic managers skilled in distressed assets and sector specialists. These managers have lost minimal money this year. These are our
sluggers.  “Capture excess returns in normal markets”  Technique: blend skilled managers who find mispriced securities and market inefficiencies over the long term, but tend to carry market and liquidity risk. Examples are bankruptcies, complex securities, litigation
processes, soft-catalyst merger and acquisitions, value equities. We believe these managers have the potential to generate solid long-term returns, but carry more symmetric returns relative to the short-term market moves (beta). Over time, however,
they tend to capture what we call “time arbitrage”. The assets they own tend to correlate to stressed markets.  Exhibit
A: Lehman Brothers Holding Company Bonds. A current example of the time arbitrage trade is the Lehman Brothers Holding Company bonds. Although positive news came out on August 30th regarding the plan of reorganization, the bonds traded down 12% in the third quarter after being overwhelmed by macroeconomic
news and rumored selling pressure from a large fund receiving redemption requests. In addition, these bonds are so attractive that many large funds already own full positions in their portfolios, so they could not buy incremental positions. On the
valuation side, our managers believe with total recoveries, a base case return is 31%, with a low case of 21% and reasonable upside case of 44%. On June 30, 2010 the LBHI bonds traded hands at a price of 27. On January 3, 2011 they changed
hands at 25. On September 30, they traded at 23.88. With a Plan of Reorganization confirmation hearing scheduled for the first two weeks of December, and cash distributions expected in the first half of 2012, in a normalized environment, we
believe that the bonds will likely trade up as more certainty is known surrounding the bankruptcy outcome. In short, we believe this example highlights the value embedded in the portfolio that can be masked by short term volatility. 
We thank our investors as we strive to provide rewarding risk adjusted long-term returns.  Sincerely,  SCS Financial

Important Definitions and Disclosures  “Correlation” — a correlation coefficient is a measure of the interdependence of two random variables that ranges in value from -1 to +1, indicating perfect negative correlation at -1, absence of
correlation at zero, and perfect positive correlation at +1.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. 
Opinions expressed are subject to change at any time, are not guarantees and should not be considered investment advice. 
This material is not an invitation to subscribe for interests in the Fund and is by way of information only. Sales of interests shall be made on the basis of the
Fund’s Confidential Offering Memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”) only and are not offered to any prospective investor who does not satisfy certain minimum financial and sophistication criteria, or in any jurisdiction in which such
offer is not authorized.  An investment in alternative investments can be highly illiquid, is speculative and not suitable for all investors. Investing
in alternative investments is only intended for experiences and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risk associated with such an investment. Performance may be volatile and there is no guarantee or assurance that an
investment in the Fund will achieve its investment objective.  Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
 Before making an investment decision, investors should consider the suitability of this investment with respect to their investment objectives and
personal situation and consider factors such as-their personal net worth, income, age, risk tolerance and liquidity needs.  An investment in the Fund,
and the underlying funds in which the Fund invests through its investment in the Master Fund (collectively, “Alternative Investment Funds”), involves risks, including the following: 
 


•
 
 Past performance of the Fund, as well as any Alternative Investment Fund in which it invests, is not indicative of future performance. The value of the
Fund’s investments will fluctuate, and there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.   


•
 
 Investing in the Fund and the Alternative Investment Funds involves a significant degree of market risk. No assurance can be given that the strategy or
strategies utilized by the Fund or an Alternative Investment Fund will be successful under any or all future market conditions. Changes in general economic conditions may affect the profitability of the Fund or an Alternative Investment Fund or
specific strategies used by such funds.   


•
 
 An investment in an Alternative Investment Fund may be highly illiquid. Such funds are subject to lock up periods and restrictions on redemptions, including in
some cases suspensions. In addition, there is no secondary market for the interests in Alternative Investment Funds, including the Fund, and none is expected to develop. There are substantial restrictions on transferring of the interests in the
Fund.   


•
 
 Alternative Investment Funds generally are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as more conventional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, and
involve risks not associated with more conventional investments.   


•
 
 Due to the early life-cycle of some Alternative Investment Funds, such funds may experience significant loss as a result of declines in an economic sector,
industry group, stock market or for portfolio infrastructure failure.

Table of Contents


•
 
 The Fund and the Alternative Investment Funds in which it invests may be leveraged and may involve other speculative investment practices that may increase the
risk of investment loss. Short selling for example involves the risk of potentially unlimited increase in the market value of the security sold short, which could result in potentially unlimited losses. In addition, investments in commodities
contracts and all derivative instruments, including futures and options, involve investment exposure that may exceed the original cost and a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact in the performance of the Fund or
Alternative Investment Fund. The prices of such investments are highly volatile and they are subject to the risk of failure of any exchanges on which the positions trade or of a clearing house. 
 


•
 
 Investments in foreign securities involve greater risk, including currency risk, different accounting standards and are subject to political instability.
  


•
 
 Neither the Fund, nor the Alternative Investment Funds in which they invest, are required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors with
respect to individual investments.   


•
 
 Because of the complex nature of Alternative Investment Funds’ investments, the distribution of tax information to investors may be subject to delays, which
may result in the need to request an extension.   


•
 
 The Fund is subject to multiple layers of fees and expenses, which may offset trading profits. By investing in a fund-of-fund such as the Fund, an investor will
indirectly bear his or her share of any fees and expenses charged by the underlying funds, in addition to the fees and expenses of the Fund. The Fund also bears its pro rate share of any fees or expenses incurred by the Master Fund.
 For a complete description of the investment objectives, risks (including additional risks related to certain potential Fund
investments and/or strategies such as Margin Borrowing, Arbitrage, Swap Agreements, Call and Put Options and other Hedging Transactions), as well as conflicts of interest, fees and expenses associated with an investment in the Fund please review the
relevant sections in the Fund’s Offering Memorandum which should be reviewed in its entirety prior to investment.  This document has been prepared

“Master Fund”), a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that is registered under the 1940 Act. The Master Fund pursues its investment objective by allocating its assets among a diversified group of hedge funds managed
by portfolio managers with differing styles and strategies (“Portfolio Funds”).  The financial statements of the Master Fund, including the
Schedule of Investments, are attached to this report and should be read in conjunction with the Fund’s financial statements. The percentage of the Master Fund owned by the Offshore Fund at September 30, 2011 was 66.91%. 
The Fund and Master Fund are managed by SCS Capital Management, LLC (the “Adviser”). The Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The Fund has a Board of Directors (the “Board”) that has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the
Fund’s investment program and its management and operations. A majority of the members of the Board are not “interested persons” (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund or the Adviser. The same directors also serve as the Master
Fund’s Board.   


2.
Significant Accounting Policies  The Fund prepares its
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America. Following are the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund:  A. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in The United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of income and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  B. Fund Expenses 
The Fund bears its own operating expenses and, through its investment in the Master Fund, its portion of the Master Fund’s operating expenses. These operating
expenses include, but are not limited to: all investment-related expenses, registration expenses, legal fees, audit and tax preparation fees and expenses, administrative and accounting expenses and fees, transfer agent fees, custody fees, costs of
insurance, fees and travel-related expenses of the Board of Directors, all costs and expenses of preparing, setting in type, printing and distributing reports and other 
  10 


Table of Contents

communications to shareholders, and such other expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board. Expenses allocated to the Fund for its indirect investments in the Portfolio Funds are
not included in the Fund’s Statement of Operations or Financial Highlights.  The Adviser and the Fund have entered into an expense limitation and
reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Limitation Agreement”) under which the Adviser has agreed to waive its fees, and/or to pay or absorb the ordinary operating expenses of the Fund (including all organization and offering expenses, as
well as the portion of the Master Fund’s fees and expenses borne by the Fund, but excluding any Portfolio Fund fees and expenses), to the extent that they exceed 2.5% per annum of the Fund’s average monthly net assets (the
“Expense Limitation”). In consideration of the Adviser’s agreement to limit the Fund’s expenses, the Fund will carry forward the amount of expenses waived, paid or absorbed by the Adviser in excess of the Expense Limitation for a
period not to exceed three years from the end of the fiscal year in which they were incurred and will reimburse the Adviser for such amounts. Reimbursement will be made as promptly as possible, but only to the extent that it does not cause the
Fund’s ordinary operating expenses to exceed the Expense Limitation. The Expense Limitation Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by the Fund. For the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011,
the Adviser waived expenses in the amount of $684,198 and $152,417, respectively.  C. Organizational and Offering Costs 
The Master Fund incurred organizational and offering costs. The Master Fund expensed all of its organizational costs of $250,363 in the first two months of
operations. The portion of the Master Fund’s organizational costs allocated to the Fund totaled $248,569. The Master Fund had total offering costs of $271,405, which it amortized over its first twelve months of operations, $156,111 in the
period ended March 31, 2011 and $115,294 in the six months ended September 30, 2011. The portion of the Master Fund’s offering costs allocated to the Fund in the period ended March 31, 2011 totaled $138,120 and in the six months
ended September 30, 2011 totaled $88,888.  D. Investments in the Master Fund  The Fund records its investment in the Master Fund at fair value which is represented by the Fund’s proportionate indirect interest in the net assets of the Master Fund as of September 30, 2011. Valuation
of Portfolio Funds and other investments held by the Master Fund is discussed in the notes to the Master Fund’s financial statements. The Fund records its pro rata share of the Master Fund’s income, expenses and realized and unrealized
gains and losses. The performance of the Fund is directly affected by the performance of the Master Fund. The financial statements of the Master Fund, which are attached, are an integral part of these financial statements. Please refer to the
accounting policies disclosed in the financial statements of the Master Fund for additional information regarding significant accounting policies that affect the Fund.  E. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  F. Fair Value  The fair values of the Fund’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the Accounting Standards Codification 825, Financial Instruments, approximate the carrying amounts presented in
the statement of assets and liabilities.  G. Income Taxes  The Fund’s tax year end is December 31. The Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Each member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to such member’s

  11 


Table of Contents

distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
The Fund is subject to authoritative guidance related to the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under U.S. GAAP. This guidance sets forth a
minimum threshold for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken based on the technical merits of such positions. Management is not aware of any exposure to uncertain tax positions that could require accrual. As of September 30,
2011, the Fund’s tax years since inception remain open and subject to examination by relevant taxing authorities.  H. Indemnifications
 Under the Fund’s organizational documents, its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnification to other parties. The Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred, and may not occur. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 


3.
Investment Transactions  For the six months ended
September 30, 2011, the Fund purchased (at cost) and sold interests (proceeds) of the Master Fund in the amount of $10,123,371 and $0, respectively.   


4.
Management and Performance Fees, Administration Fees and Custodian Fees  The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with SCS Capital Management, LLC. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Master Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee, which is calculated and
accrued monthly, (the “Advisory Fee”) at the annual rate of 1.25% of the Master Fund’s net assets. So long as substantially all of the assets of the Fund are invested in the Master Fund, the Fund does not pay the Adviser a separate
fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Fund does however, due to its investment in the Master Fund, bear its proportionate percentage of the Advisory Fee paid to the Adviser by the Master Fund. 
The Fund has engaged U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to serve as the Fund’s administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. The Master Fund pays the
administrator a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.070% of the first $150,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets, 0.050% on the next $250,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets and 0.030% on the
balance of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets with a minimum annual fee of $70,000. There is no fee directly attributable to the Fund other than its allocated portion of the Master Fund’s expenses. 
The Fund has engaged U.S. Bank, N.A. to serve as the Fund’s custodian. The Master Fund pays the custodian a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.001% of
the Master Fund’s portfolio market value with a minimum annual fee of $5,000. There is no fee directly attributable to the Fund other than its allocated portion of the Master Fund’s expenses. 
 


5.
Directors and Officers  The Board has overall responsibility
to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund and the Master Fund, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund’s and the Master
Fund’s business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Fund and the Master 
  12 


Table of Contents

Fund as are customarily exercised by the board of directors of a registered investment company organized as a corporation. A listing of the Board members is on the back cover of this report. The
Independent Directors are each paid (in the aggregate) by the Fund and the Master Fund an annual retainer of $20,000, and per meeting fees of $5,000 in the case of regular meetings, $2,000 in the case of telephonic meetings. All Directors are
reimbursed by the Fund and the Master Fund for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Directors do not receive any pension or retirement benefits from the Fund or the Master Fund. Two of the Directors are employees of the Adviser and receive
no compensation from the Fund or Master Fund for serving as Directors.  All of the Officers of the Fund and Master Fund are affiliated with the Adviser.
Such Officers receive no compensation from the Fund or Master Fund for serving in their respective roles. The Board appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to the Company in accordance with federal securities regulations. 
 


6.
Shareholder Transactions  No shareholder will have the right
to require the Fund to redeem shares, although the Fund may from time to time repurchase shares as of the last day of a calendar quarter pursuant to written tenders by shareholders. Whether repurchases will be made during any given quarter will be
determined by the Board in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase shares from shareholders, the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser. The Adviser expects that it will generally recommend to
the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase shares on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The minimum initial investment required is $25,000. At September 30, 2011, $492,500 investor capital subscriptions were received in advance.
 The Fund had 1,380,301 shares outstanding at September 30, 2011. The Fund has issued 1,007,779 and 372,522 shares through shareholder subscriptions
during the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.   


7.
Risk Factors  Because of the limitation on rights of
redemption and the fact that the Shares will not be traded on any securities exchange or other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer, and because of the fact that the Adviser may invest the Master Fund’s assets in
Portfolio Funds that do not permit frequent withdrawals and may invest in illiquid securities, an investment in the Fund is highly illiquid and involves a substantial degree of risk. Portfolio Funds are riskier than liquid securities because the
Portfolio Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Portfolio
Funds may cause investors to incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund during or following periods of negative performance. Although the Fund may offer to repurchase shares from time to time, there can be no
assurance such offers will be made with any regularity. The Master Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the 1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using different
strategies and investment techniques, including leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment
return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Master Fund’s net
asset value. Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Fund, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to limited liquidity of the
shares. The Portfolio Funds 
  13 


Table of Contents

provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock-up provisions of up to three years from initial investment. 
 


8.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Fund has adopted
authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation
techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below. 
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 
Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
risk, etc.).  Level 3 — Valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant. The Master Fund utilized
the Portfolio Funds’ month-end NAVs as of the reporting date for fair value. The Portfolio Funds require a redemption notice, and generally include a lock-up period, which results in significant unobservable inputs as of the reporting date.
 The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of September 30, 2011;

SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC  Notes to Financial Statements  September 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 
   
 


1.
Organization  SCS Hedged Opportunities Master Fund, LLC (the
“Master Fund”) was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of Delaware on April 7, 2010, and commenced operations on September 1, 2010. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Fund’s investment objective is to seek attractive, long-term capital appreciation with volatility that is lower than that of the equity
market and returns that demonstrate a low correlation to both the equity and fixed income markets. The Master Fund pursues its investment objective by allocating its assets among a diversified group of hedge funds managed by portfolio managers with
differing styles and strategies (“Portfolio Funds”).  The SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is
registered under the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company (the “Feeder Fund”) pursues its investment objectives by investing substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Feeder Fund has the
same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies as the Master Fund (except that the Feeder Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in the Master Fund).  The SCS Hedged Opportunities (TE) Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered under the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company (the “TE Feeder
Fund”, together with the “Feeder Fund” the “Feeder Funds”) pursues its investment objectives by investing substantially all of its assets in the SCS Hedged Opportunities Fund, LDC (the “Offshore Fund”), a Cayman
Islands limited duration company. The Offshore Fund is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Offshore Fund in turn invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The TE Feeder Fund and Offshore
Fund have the same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies as the Master Fund (except that they pursue their investment objectives by investing in the Master Fund).  The Master Fund and Feeder Funds are managed by SCS Capital Management, LLC (the “Adviser”). The Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The Master Fund has a Board of Directors (the “Board”) that has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the Fund’s investment program
and its management and operations. A majority of the members of the Board are not “interested persons” (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund or the Adviser. The same directors also serve as the Feeder Funds’ Board. 
 


2.
Significant Accounting Policies  The Master Fund prepares its
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America. Following are the significant accounting policies adopted by the Master Fund:  A. Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in The United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
  25 


Table of Contents

the reported amount of assets and liabilities, recognition of income and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  B. Fund Expenses  The Master
Fund bears its own operating expenses. These operating expenses include, but are not limited to: all investment-related expenses, registration expenses, legal fees, audit and tax preparation fees and expenses, administrative and accounting expenses
and fees, transfer agent fees, custody fees, costs of insurance, fees and travel-related expenses of the Board of Directors, all costs and expenses of preparing, setting in type, printing and distributing reports and other communications to
shareholders, and such other expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board. Expenses allocated to the Master Fund for its investments in the Portfolio Funds are not included in the Master Fund’s Statement of Operations or Financial
Highlights.  C. Organizational and Offering Costs 
The Master Fund incurred organizational and offering costs. The Master Fund expensed all of its organizational costs of $250,363 in the first two months of
operations. The Master Fund had total offering costs of $271,405, which it amortized over its first twelve months of operations, $156,111 and $115,294 in the period ended March 31, 2011 and the six months ended September 30, 2011,
respectively.  D. Investments in Portfolio Funds 
In accordance with the terms of the Master Fund’s Prospectus, the investments in the Portfolio Funds are valued at their fair value. 
The Fund has the ability to liquidate its investments periodically, ranging from monthly to annually, depending on the provisions of the respective Portfolio Fund
agreements. Generally, the General Partners and/or Investment Managers of the Portfolio Funds can suspend redemptions.  Certain Portfolio Funds incur
annual management fees ranging from 1% to 2% of a Portfolio Fund’s net assets. The Portfolio Funds also receive performance allocations of up to 20% of their net profits as defined by the respective Portfolio Fund agreements. 
The Portfolio Funds in which the Fund has investments utilize a variety of financial instruments in their trading strategies including equity and debt securities,
options, futures, and swap contracts. Several of these financial instruments contain varying degrees of off-balance sheet risk, whereby changes in fair value of the securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the amounts
recorded on each of the Portfolio Fund’s balance sheets. In addition, the Portfolio Funds may sell securities short whereby a liability is created to repurchase the security at prevailing prices. Such Portfolio Funds’ ultimate obligations
to satisfy the sale of securities sold short may exceed the amount recognized on their balance sheets. However, due to the nature of the Master Fund’s interest in the Portfolio Funds, such risks are limited to the Master Fund’s invested
amount in each investee.  Of the Portfolio Funds listed on the Schedule of Investments, 9 were acquired during the period and 14 remained subject to
lock-up periods expiring in one to three years from their respective purchase dates. Of these investments, 8 can be redeemed prior to the lock-up period for a penalty ranging from 1% to 5% of the redemption amount. 
E. Investment Valuation  The Master Fund primarily invests
in private Portfolio Funds that are not listed on a securities exchange. Prior to investing in any Portfolio Fund, the Adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the Portfolio Fund. 
 
  26 


Table of Contents
The Master Fund’s valuation procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information available at the
time the Master Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by a Portfolio Fund manager does not represent the fair value of the
Company’s interests in that Portfolio Fund. Although redemptions of interests in Portfolio Funds are subject to advance notice requirements, Portfolio Funds typically will make available net asset value information to holders representing the
price at which, even in the absence of redemption activity, a Portfolio Fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if, in accordance with the terms of the Portfolio Fund’s governing documents, it would be
necessary to effect a mandatory redemption. Following procedures adopted by the Board, in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular Portfolio Fund, the Master Fund would consider whether it was appropriate, in light
of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to net asset value. For example, when a Portfolio Fund imposes
extraordinary restrictions on redemptions, or when there have been no recent transactions in Portfolio Fund interests, the Adviser may determine that it is appropriate to apply such a discount. Any such decision would be made in good faith, and
subject to the review and supervision of the Board.  The Adviser assesses the accuracy of each Portfolio Fund’s reported monthly net asset value
using various means. These may include comparing a reported valuation with one or more strategy-specific benchmarks that the Adviser believes correlate with the strategy of the Portfolio Fund; discussing the performance of the Portfolio Fund with
the manager’s personnel; or reviewing and analyzing the Portfolio Fund’s audited financial statements.  The valuations reported by the
Portfolio Funds’ managers, upon which the Master Fund calculates its month-end net asset value and net asset value per share may be subject to later adjustment, based on information reasonably available at that time. For example, fiscal
year-end net asset value calculations of the Portfolio Funds are audited by those Portfolio Funds’ independent public accountants, during their respective fiscal year end, and may be revised as a result of such audits. Other adjustments may
occur from time to time. To the extent these adjustments materially impact the Master Fund’s net asset value, management will appropriately adjust participants’ transactions to ensure they are not materially harmed. 
F. Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents
include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  G. Fair Value 
The fair values of the Master Fund’s assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments under the Accounting Standards Codification 825, Financial
Instruments, approximate the carrying amounts presented in the statement of assets and liabilities.  H. Income Taxes 
The Master Fund’s tax year end is December 31. The Master Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Each member is responsible for
the tax liability or benefit relating to such member’s distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 
The Master Fund is subject to authoritative guidance related to the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions under U.S. GAAP. This guidance sets forth a
minimum threshold for the financial statement recognition of tax positions taken based on the technical merits of such positions. 
  27 


Table of Contents

Management is not aware of any exposure to uncertain tax positions that could require accrual. As of September 30, 2011, the Master Fund’s tax years since inception remain open and
subject to examination by relevant taxing authorities.  I. Indemnifications  Under the Master Fund’s organizational documents, its officers and directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, in the normal
course of business, the Master Fund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnification to other parties. The Master Fund’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Master Fund that have not yet occurred, and may not occur. However, the Master Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
 


3.
Investment Transactions  For the six months ended
September 30, 2011, the Master Fund purchased (at cost) and sold interests (proceeds) in Portfolio Funds in the amount of $22,835,985 and $1,435,985 (excluding short-term securities), respectively. The Master Fund purchased (at cost) and sold
interests (proceeds) in investment securities in the amount of $165,428 and $0 (excluding short-term securities), respectively.   


4.
Management and Performance Fees, Administration Fees and Custodian Fees  The Master Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with SCS Capital Management, LLC. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Master Fund pays the Adviser a quarterly fee, which is calculated and
accrued monthly, (the “Advisory Fee”) at the annual rate of 1.25% of the Master Fund’s net assets.  The Master Fund has engaged U.S.
Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to serve as the Master Fund’s administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. The Master Fund pays the administrator a monthly fee computed at an annual rate of 0.070% of the first $150,000,000 of the Master
Fund’s total monthly net assets, 0.050% on the next $250,000,000 of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets and 0.030% on the balance of the Master Fund’s total monthly net assets with a minimum annual fee of $70,000.

rate of 0.001% of the Master Fund’s portfolio market value with a minimum annual fee of $5,000.   


5.
Directors and Officers  The Board has overall responsibility
to manage and control the business affairs of the Master Fund and the Feeder Funds, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Master Fund’s and the
Feeder Funds’ business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Master Fund and the Feeder Funds as are customarily exercised by the board of directors of a registered investment company organized as
a corporation. A listing of the Board members is on the back cover of this report. The Independent Directors are each paid (in the aggregate) by the Master Fund an annual retainer of $20,000, and per meeting fees of $5,000 in the case of regular
meetings, $2,000 in the case of telephonic meetings. All Directors are reimbursed by the Master Fund for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Directors do not receive any pension or retirement benefits

from the Master Fund or the Feeder Funds. Two of the Directors are employees of the Adviser and receive no compensation from the Master Fund or Feeder Funds for serving as Directors. 
All of the Officers of the Master Fund and Feeder Funds are affiliated with the Adviser. Such Officers receive no compensation from the Master Fund or Feeder Funds
for serving in their respective roles. The Board appointed a Chief Compliance Officer to the Company in accordance with federal securities regulations.   


6.
Shareholder Transactions  The Master Fund from time to time
may offer to repurchase Interests pursuant to written tenders by Investors. Any such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its complete and exclusive discretion. In determining
whether the Master Fund should repurchase Interests or portions thereof from Investors pursuant to written tenders, the Board will consider the recommendation of the Adviser. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the
Master Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Investors, on a quarterly basis, on or about March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st of each year.  The Master Fund had 2,110,651 shares outstanding at September 30, 2011. The Master Fund has issued 1,256,681 and 853,970 shares through shareholder subscriptions during the period ended March 31, 2011 and
the six months ended September 30, 2011, respectively.   


7.
Risk Factors  Because of the limitation on rights of
redemption and the fact that the Shares will not be traded on any securities exchange or other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer, and because of the fact that the Adviser may invest the Master Fund’s assets in
Portfolio Funds that do not permit frequent withdrawals and may invest in illiquid securities, an investment in the Master Fund is highly illiquid and involves a substantial degree of risk. Portfolio Funds are riskier than liquid securities because
the Portfolio Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Portfolio
Funds may cause investors to incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Master Fund during or following periods of negative performance. Although the Master Fund may offer to repurchase shares from time to time,
there can be no assurance such offers will be made with any regularity. The Master Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the 1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using
different strategies and investment techniques, including leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater
investment return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Master
Fund’s net asset value. Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Master Fund, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to
limited liquidity of the shares. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock-up provisions of up to three years from initial investment. 
 


8.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Master Fund has
adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value. These standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and
valuation techniques used to develop the 
  29 


Table of Contents

measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.
 Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 
Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
risk, etc.).  Level 3 — Valuations based primarily on inputs that are unobservable and significant. The Master Fund utilized
the Portfolio Funds’ month-end NAVs as of the reporting date for fair value. The Portfolio Funds require a redemption notice, and generally include a lock-up period, which results in significant unobservable inputs as of the reporting date.
 The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. 
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Master Fund’s investments as of September 30, 2011;
