About Blueprint
Why we do what we do




Why Blueprint Was Created

Somewhere along the way, registries started to become a hassle. But we felt that selecting and receiving gifts — that should always be fun. That’s our goal. We’re Blueprint Registry.
                        We’re excited to help our users get the most out of their registries by creating a platform that makes it easy to ask for cash, personalize their experience, and keep multiple registries from top retailers all in one place. At Blueprint Registry, we’ve created a simple-yet-stunning way to ask for gifts that will take you to the the next stage of your life.





Who We Are

Blueprint Registry is a collection of problem solvers and innovators working together to change the online registry sphere. Our office is located in sunny Seattle, Washington. There may be fewer of us than you’d think, but we can do more than you’d ever imagine.

Everyday Import pulls product information straight from the retailer’s website. There are no rooms associated with these products on the retailer website. We are working to add an option to edit a gift’s “room” in the near future.If you would like to have your items sorted into corresponding rooms on Blueprint, please send your request to support@blueprintregistry.com.

Blueprint Aims to Disrupt $19 Billion Annual Wedding Registry Market with Industry-First Design and Technology







Blueprint Registry gives couples a visual representation of how gifts will actually fit into their home and helps them discover products that truly reflect their personal style. - Lizzy Ellingson, Founder


New York, New York (PRWEB)
February 25, 2014
 Blueprint Registry, http://www.BlueprintRegistry.com, the first online wedding registry to offer engaged couples the ability to create a customized wedding wish list based on the layout of their home, announced its public launch today. Engaged couples can now receive personalized style and quantity recommendations based on their home’s layout and better visualize their needs as they shop room by room. 
Blueprint Registry aims to disrupt the $19 billion annual wedding registry industry by leveraging its industry-first technology to make the wedding registry process a more visually inspiring, personalized, and streamlined experience. 
“Current wedding registries, both big box retailers and niche registries, organize gifts in a list format, making a registry feel more like a “to-do” list than a compilation of great products that inspire and excite you,” said Lizzy Ellingson, Chief Creative Officer and Co-Founder of Blueprint Registry. “We wanted to help couples envision their new life together by giving them a visual representation of how these gifts will actually fit into their home and help them discover products that truly reflect their personal style.” 
Blueprint Registry’s custom multi-merchant marketplace offers a collection of highly rated products from well-known stores like Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, and Amazon, as well as a collection of unique gifts from select designers and boutiques. This combined product offering allows couples to register for great products they know and love, while also giving them the option to register for speciality items. 
Blueprint aims to further streamline the wedding shopping experience by allowing couples to search for gifts based on their personal style (traditional. modern, rustic, or vintage), making it even easier to shop for, and find, the products they love. Blueprint also guarantees an array of high-quality gift ideas by leveraging a combination of crowd-sourced reviews (e.g. Amazon reviews) and style editors’ recommendations.
Blueprint’s novel tagging functionality allows couples to specify who registered for each gift and the seamless group gifting feature allows family and friends to join together to purchase any item a couple desires, giving couples the ability to create price points that appeal to their guests. 
The Blueprint experience runs start to finish, with each couple receiving a post-wedding purchase summary and concise return summary sheet organized by vendor two weeks after their wedding date. This registry summary gives couples the ability to easily view every gift purchased, along with each purchaser’s name and contact information, making sending “thank you” cards and processing returns easier than ever. 
Blueprint Registry is free for both engaged couples and guests. To register, or for more information, please visit http://www.blueprintregistry.com. 
========================================================================
About Blueprint Registry: 
Blueprint Registry™ is the first and only online wedding registry to offer engaged couples the ability to create a customized wedding wish list based on the layout of their home. Blueprint aims to be the best-in-class online gift registry website by making the wedding registry process a more visually inspiring, personalized, and streamlined experience. Becoming a member of Blueprint Registry is free for both engaged couples and guests. To register, or for more information, http://www.blueprintregistry.com.
