(WAT) Rolls Out New Products at Pitcon 2017Zacks Equity ResearchZacksMarch 7, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLeading analytical laboratory instrument and software provider, Waters Corporation WAT unveiled its latest offerings at the Pittcon Conference and Expo, an annual conference and exposition on laboratory science.The company launched a “cloud deployable, compliance ready enterprise Chromatography Data Software (CDS)” – Empower Cloud. Also, it expanded its TA Instruments product line by adding three 800 Series dilatometers as well as launching SDT 650. Waters Corp. has an active research and development (R&D) division primarily focused on the development and commercialization of products which complement and update its existing product offerings.Introduction of Empower Cloud continues the decades old legacy of Waters Corp.’s Empower Software. Empower Cloud is built on Waters Corp.’s easy-to-use software with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is confident that this offering will help clients improve consistency, quality and compliance standards, and boost intellectual property protection.The latest Discovery Simultaneous Differential Scanning Calorimeter/Thermogravimetric Analyzer (“DSC/TGA”) SDT 650 is built on TA’s state-of-the-art technologies, including Modulated DSC, Modulated TGA, and Hi-Res TGA. It can provide unprecedented sensitivity, baseline stability, temperature and atmospheric control for clients, and can unlock opportunities for research. With this launch, Waters Corp. has pioneered the development of a simultaneous DSC/TGA device, which can find use in both research and production control environments.In addition, TA Instruments unveiled three new 800 Series dilatometers – DIL 820, DIL 830 and ODP 860. Leveraging on TA’s exclusive True Differential technology and patented optical sensors, these devices can analyze samples with a resolution of up to 1 nm. They also feature high speed, no temperature-gradient furnaces which can reduce downtime between tests. Waters Corp. believes that these instruments can be deployed in a wide range of applications, ranging from material science to metals.Waters Corp.’s had a disappointing run in the last quarter of 2016, as the stock declined 15.2%, faring worse than the Zacks classified Instrument-Scientific industry’s average decline of 7.1%. However, since then, the company has managed to recoup most of those losses, having appreciated 14.2% so far in 2017, better than the industry’s average return of 12.1%.We believe an increased demand for research intensive products, especially this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a major positive that will drive the company’s top line, going forward. New regulatory requirements by China’s Food and Drug Administration have been bolstering sales in China. Moving ahead, the company believes its industry-leading “Empower chromatography data systems” positions it well to reap the benefits from stringent regulatory standards.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, Science Applications International Corporation SAIC and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. UBNT. While Applied Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Science Applications and Ubiquiti Networks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Read MoreWith four back-to-back earnings beat, Applied Materials has an average positive surprise of 3.9% for the last four quarters.Science Applications International has a striking earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates in each of them, for a remarkable average of 9.2%.Ubiquiti Networks has managed to beat earnings estimates thrice over the trailing four quarters.

Waters Corp. (WAT  -  Free Report)	 unveiled a broad range of innovative breakthrough products at the 2015 Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy. The company, in particular, highlighted technologically advanced products related to molecular imaging, laboratory management systems, among others.Products InformationLeveraging the technological advancement in molecular imaging, Waters Corp. brings in a new full spectrum molecular imaging system that will allow research laboratories to locate the distribution of large and small molecules within tissue samples detail with great accuracy. This new system, which is based on SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer of Waters Corp., is a first of its kind to combine capabilities of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (‘MALDI’), desorption electrospray ionization (‘DESI’) and ion mobility separation (‘IMS’) in a single spectrometry platform.Apart from this, Waters Corp. disclosed an alternative to a traditional laboratory information management system (‘LIMS’) – NuGenesis Lab Management System. This highly advanced system will aid science-driven organizations to seamlessly manage their lab-to-business connections across the globe.Moreover, for optimization of converge chromatography, Waters Corp. expanded its ACQUITY UPC2 portfolio via new analytical columns for chiral and achiral separations – Waters ACQUITY UPC2 Trefoil Columns and Waters ACQUITY UPC2 Trefoil Columns, respectively.In addition to all these developments, Waters Corp. doubled the capacity of its SFE Bio-Botanical Extraction System (‘BBSE’) through the introduction of a new 10-liter extraction vessel. The company’s BBSE is a multi-fluid supercritical fluid extraction system, which works as a high-pressure separator for collecting extracted compounds.Our TakeThe abovementioned product introductions are at par with Waters Corp.’s aim of launching a range of innovative products and programs, this year. Notably, the company has an active research and development division (‘R&D’) that is primarily focused on the development and commercialization of products that complement as well as update its existing product offerings.Waters Corp. spends a significant amount on R&D as most of its products are manufactured in-house across its facilities. Moreover, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for Waters Corp.’s business which has been on an uptrend lately. In the last reported quarter, the company benefited from increased medical initiatives spending. We believe this will go a long way in boosting the company’s top line.Waters Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some other stocks worth considering within the industry include Axcelis Technologies Inc. (ACLS  -  Free Report)	, Newport Corp.  and Universal Electronics Inc. (UEIC  -  Free Report)	. All stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

History[edit]
The business was started by James (Jim) Logan Waters as Waters Associates in an office in the basement of a police station in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1958.[3][4]
Waters enrolled in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, an officer training program, and graduated from Columbia University as an ensign with a B.S. degree in Physics in 1946. After stints as a university math teacher, Naval officer, project engineer, and entrepreneur, Waters formed Waters Associates in 1958. The fledgling firm’s first offices were in the rented basement of the Framingham, Mass. police station. During these years, Waters Associates was what is now referred to as a research boutique. Companies would contract Waters and his five employees to build one-of-a-kind instruments for various purposes. Early products included a boiler feedwater flame photometer, a balloon hydrometer, a nerve gas detector, a lab refractometer and process control refractometers. While from its start the company had been self-financed, with proceeds from an earlier business sale, Waters opened Waters Associates to external ownership in 1962.
The company’s first major break came when Dow Chemical bought one of Waters’ first gel permeation chromatography instruments, Dow Chemical made an additional investment of $400,000. By 1979, Dow Chemical had attained nearly 25 percent ownership in Waters.
In 1967, the ALC 100, the first Waters LC system, was brought to market. According to Leslie S. Ettre in a review about Jim Waters, the LC system was formally introduced at the 1968 Pittsburgh Conference. It was a benchtop system equipped with a Milton Roy pump, syringe injection, and two detectors: a Waters differential refractometer and a UV detector from the Laboratory Data Control (LDC) Co.
In 1969, Dimitri D’Arbeloff, then president of Millipore Corporation, joined the corporation's board of directors. Millipore’s venture capital subsidiary made a $600,000 equity investment in Waters.
Waters next big break came in 1972 when Dr. Helmut Hamberger, chief post-doc for Nobel Laureate Dr. Robert Woodward of Harvard University, sought Jim Waters’ help to the first synthesis of vitamin B12. Dr. Hamberger wanted to purify the positional isomers, which were needed to give him the right compound for the final stages of the synthesis. Working with Dr. Hamberger, the pair took two days to develop a separation, five more days to obtain larger columns to scale up the separation, and three more days to prep his material. In the end, the two had isolated and purified 200 mg of the precursor compound.[3]
In 1972, Waters Associates appointed Frank Zenie president. A year later, headquarters moved from Framingham to a semi-rural 26-acre (110,000 m2) site in Milford, Massachusetts. Waters became chairman, and continued in that role until the company merged with Millipore in 1980, and was rechristened the Waters Chromatograph Division.
The sought-for synergies between the two companies never materialized, however. And, in 1993, Waters returned to independence under the leadership of Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Douglas A. Berthiaume. In 1997 Waters entered mass spectrometry market with acquisition of Micromass for $176 million. On 11 June 2012, Waters India celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary in India.[5]
Products[edit]
Waters’ main product brands include: ACQUITY UPLC systems, ACQUITY UPC2 Systems, Xevo mass spectrometry systems, Synapt MS systems, Synapt HDMS systems, XTerra HPLC columns, XBridge columns, ACQUITY UPLC columns, Alliance HPLC systems, Empower chromatography and MassLynx mass spectrometry software, Oasis sample preparation products, NuGenesis lab management system (LMS).

The sought-for synergies between the two companies never materialized, however. And, in 1993, Waters returned to independence under the leadership of Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Douglas A. Berthiaume. In 1997 Waters entered mass spectrometry market with acquisition of Micromass for $176 million. On 11 June 2012, Waters India celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary in India.[5]
