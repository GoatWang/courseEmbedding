              Abstract




As of 2000, 380,000 patients in the United States received dialysis for End Stage Renal Disease at a cost of $19.5 billion. Hemodialysis requires patient treatment 3 times a week for 3-4 hours. Peritoneal dialysis is an option utilized by less than 10% of patients requiring manual exchange of 2 liters of dialysate every 4 hours or having a machine make these exchanges more frequently while the patient is sleeping. Compliance is low for this intense procedure, and the treatment becomes inadequate with complete kidney failure, requiring a transfer to hemodialysis. Unfortunately, mortality with either technique is over 20% per year. Sonos Medical's ultimate goal is to produce a wearable, automated, peritoneal-based artificial kidney that operates continuously to remove metabolic wastes and toxins. This will liberate the dialysis patient from the chore of present therapy and eliminate the rapid biochemical swings and fluid shifts that cause a constellation of debilitating symptoms and impose a very restricted life style. The unit will consist of a disposable core sorbent assembly, combined with connectors, waste disposal for excess fluid, and enrichment reservoirs for additives. The Phase I SBIR project will test the efficiency and interoperability of the 4 modules that comprise the sorbent assembly. 
The Specific Aims  are: 1) Immobilize urease to hydrolize urea, the major waste eliminated by the kidney, 2) Develop a cation exchange unit based on zirconium phosphate, 3) Achieve anion exchange using a zirconium oxide module, 4) Optimize removal of creatinine and other small to medium organics with an activated charcoal module, 5) Integrate these cartridges for 4 hours at 2L/hr of continuous removal of wastes from a model spent dialysate, and 6) Scale up the system for an 8-10 hour nocturnal cycle. The Phase I effort continues for 6 months and delivers a collection of chemical and physical processes, performing in concert, forming the basis of an integrated, self-contained device for daytime and nocturnal peritoneal dialysis which will be developed during Phase II.

BOONE — According to his father, missing student James Martin Roberts left a note for friends and family before disappearing on April 21.Roberts, a Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute student, was last seen around 12:30 p.m. near the Holmes Convocation Center that day, and police reported that he was missing on April 22.Boone Police have led the investigation of his disappearance — searching area trails and wooded areas and sharing information across the state — but thus far have been unable to locate the missing 19-year-old.
Martin’s father, John Roberts, said the note his son left was vague and ambiguous, but led him to believe his son may have desired to “go off the grid” for a period of time.“Since the note is pretty generic, it does give us hope that this is just a scenario of him not knowing what he wanted to do — just that where he was wasn’t it, and he didn’t know how to get out if it,” Roberts said. “That happens to people in all walks of life and at all ages. They get into situations they don’t know how to get out of and sometimes they don’t handle it the best way. Like this — they just disappear.”Roberts said that it was extremely out of character for Martin to go without contacting his friends and family. He said his son is a “very social, friendly and tuned-in person.”“He is very engaged as far as being in contact with family and friends,” Roberts said. “He didn’t necessarily post something on Facebook every time he did something, but he was engaged socially with the world. It is out of character for him to walk away from the grid — to not watch something on Netflix or play an online game with his friends. To just walk away from it all is just very unusual — very concerning.”Roberts said his last conversation with his son was a hopeful, forward-looking talk about budgeting and saving money. He said Martin only possessed funds for day-to-day living expenses and there was no evidence to suggest he had a large amount of cash on hand when he went missing.Roberts said his family has been hesitant to overplay the note in the past weeks so as not to sensationalize the story, or to complicate Boone PD’s search with false leads. The note, Roberts said, contained no real detail as to Martin’s intentions.“We’ve tried to downplay the note a whole lot because it wasn’t like he said, ‘I’m going to do this, or I’m going to go there,’” Roberts said. “It is very vague and very general. The average person reading it wouldn’t say, ‘Well, you know this is the worst-case scenario, and it is only a matter of time before you find out what happened.’ It wasn’t that way at all. The note is pretty much ‘I’m starting some journey — I’m going somewhere.’”
Roberts said he is hopeful that as news of Martin’s disappearance continues to spread, there will be a sighting of his son. He said Martin is familiar with the coast, especially with Ocean Isle Beach.According to Roberts, police have provided information on Martin to Wilmington and Myrtle Beach law enforcement.Capt. Andy Le Beau of the Boone Police Department said that his investigation has distributed information on Martin to several homeless shelters around the state during the past days. Places, Le Beau said, where someone might be able to live off the grid or lay low.James Martin Roberts was last seen wearing a black, short sleeve, Appalachian State windbreaker, khaki shorts, gray New Balance shoes and a white golf visor hat when last seen. He is 5-foot-10 and 145 pounds.Anyone with information is asked to call the Boone Police Department at (828) 268-6900 or High Country Crime Stoppers at (828) 268-6959 or (828) 737-0125. Persons may also submit a Crime Stoppers tip at www.tipsubmit.com/webtips.aspx?AgencyID=1251 or text “NCTIP plus your tip” to 274637 (CRIMES).

Laminates



We specialise in high barrier, long shelf life laminated films for direct packing applications. Our dual purpose laminators also allow us to solvent free laminate and apply pattern cold seal coatings in register.
Roberts Mart has built an unrivalled reputation for supplying high quality laminated products. Our in-house extrusion facilities allow us to manufacture sealing layers specific to your requirements.
Key elements of our service include:

Solvent free lamination
Paper and film combinations
Paperstrip Laminates
Pattern Cold Seal Laminates
High Barrier laminates for CAP and MAP applications
Peelable laminates for bespoke trays and base webs
Eco friendly packaging solutions using degradable films and papers

We also offer pre-laminated papers and film constructions for downstream printing and converting.
 
 
 













Collation Shrink Films
Our printed and plain collation shrink film, or shrink wrap, is used by leading food and drink manufacturers to provide safe transit packaging and enhance the shelf appeal of their multi-pack products.
We aim to achieve an optimum balance of the most cost effective film, whilst maintaining the best pack integrity, appearance and performance. Coupled with this we have great flexibility in our production process with the ability to print up to ten colours on our state of the art presses, with a repeat length of up to 1350mm.
We stay at the forefront of product development. We’re constantly analysing film structures and thickness to give better shrink, better clarity and a most cost effective solution. Our knowledgable, experienced and hands on team collaborate closely with you from pack concept through to finished design.













Form Fill and Seal Films
Reel fed films for horizontal or vertical form fill and seal lines can be supplied in a variety of substrates, be they simple OPP mono web constructions or multi-layer high barrier laminates.
All our films are custom designed to suit your lines and application and we take a holistic approach when advising you on the correct film type and specification to use. This takes into account product protection, line performance, value and brand integrity. Combining the optimum film specification with our excellent HD Flexo print capabilities will allow your product to carry maximum brand impact when on shelf.
 











Home Textiles Packaging
We supply a range of converted products for home textile, duvet and pillow packaging including plain and printed bags, bags on a roll and draw string bags plus a range of recycled options.
Our intricate conversion facility means we can also offer tailor made styles including side weld, bottom weld, mixed weld, clip close handle, slot handle, rope handle, self-seal strip, captive flap and dumpy style bags.
As experts in this field, we can provide advice on all aspects of your product, whether this is the optimum base film or the most cost effective print option or a tailor made bag construction.
Producing over half a million printed bags a week for the duvet and pillow sector we are the market leader. We have been supplying the sector for over twenty years developing and pioneering a great many styles of bags still prevalent today.
Whatever your volume or speed of turnaround a converted product from Roberts Mart will be delivered on time.











Pouches
Pouches are becoming ever more prevalent in the retail environment with consumers looking for more cost effective options for storing and retailing goods in. Pouches offer a variety of solutions and have a strong visual impact on the shelf.
We are able to offer a variety of styles and formats including stand up pouches and Doy packs. These can be supplied with our without resealable closures which are particularly useful in refill applications. Optional laser scored lines for ease of opening are also available.
Pouches are often used when either trying to upsell a product or value engineer cost out of a product, for example moving away from a costly glass jar or carton to a more cost effective bag.













Paper Products
Roberts Mart was first established as a paper bag manufacturer and today uses the latest flexographic printing and paper converting systems to manufacture our paper products.
We can offer mono ply paper webs or complex multi-layer laminates to suit your application and/or packing lines. We also have the ability to supply paper strip laminates where a window is required to display the packed product.














Laser Scored Films
Optional laser scribing is available for customers wanting film score lines for selective film weakening to create an easy tear opening. These are ideal for packs where a closure is also applied such as a zipper.
Score lines can be created in the machine direction or across the web in either a straight or curved line. The lines are added whilst maintaining pack integrity and strength and also protecting any barrier properties.
This solution is ideally suited for packaging used for pet foods, horticulture products and household items.
