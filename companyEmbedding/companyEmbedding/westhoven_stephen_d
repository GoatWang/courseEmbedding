This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Westhoven Promoted At NJR Energy Services






Business Wire




May 14, 2010 2:13 PM EDT













 
















































  New Jersey Resources (NYSE:NJR) today announced the promotion of Stephen D. Westhoven to Senior Vice President of NJR Energy Services (NJRES), the wholesale energy services subsidiary of NJR.  “This year is Steve’s twentieth with our company,” said Laurence M. Downes, chairman and CEO of NJR. “He was there when we launched NJR Energy Services in 1995 and, over the past fifteen years, has played a critical role in developing the strategy and the team that has grown the business into a highly disciplined and successful operation, respected throughout the industry for its expertise and collaborative approach with customers.”  Westhoven joined New Jersey Natural Gas in 1990, working in the engineering and gas supply departments, before joining NJRES as director of energy trading. He is currently responsible for the procurement and maximization of NJRES' capacity and gas sales. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Catholic University.  Westhoven replaces Joseph P. Shields who resigned to accept a new position as President of the Millennium Pipeline.  “We are grateful for Joe’s many years of service and wish him the very best for success in the future,” said Downes. “Joe’s talent and creativity will serve him well in his new role.”  New Jersey Resources, a Fortune 1000 company, provides reliable energy and natural gas services including transportation, distribution, and asset management in states from the Gulf Coast to the New England regions, including the Mid-Continent region, the West Coast and Canada, while investing in and maintaining an extensive infrastructure to support future growth. With over $2.5 billion in annual revenues, NJR safely and reliably operates and maintains 6,700 miles of natural gas transportation and distribution infrastructure to serve nearly half a million customers; develops and manages a diverse portfolio of more than 777,000 dth/d of transportation capacity and 52 Bcf of storage capacity; and provides appliance installation, repair and contract service to approximately 144,000 homes and businesses. Additionally, NJR holds investments in midstream assets through equity partnerships including Steckman Ridge and Iroquois. Through Conserve to Preserve®, NJR is helping customers save energy and money by promoting conservation and encouraging efficiency.
