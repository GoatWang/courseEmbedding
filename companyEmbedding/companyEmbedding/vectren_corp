Automatic Payments











Flexible payment options
Due Date Extension and Payment Arrangement are two free offerings which are available 
				    to customers in need of a special payment plan on a temporary basis in order to keep 
				    service connected and manage energy costs. 
				    Find long-term assistance options











Due Date Extension
To help you avoid late payment fees and remain in good financial standing, 
							Vectren offers special one-time due date extensions for customers who qualify. 
							However, once an extension is granted, it is not permanent. Your due date will 
							return to the original date listed on your next bill. There is no fee for 
							enrolling in the program. You can enroll in Due Date Extension 
							online via your Vectren.com account 
							or by contacting a representative using our Live Chat service or by 
							calling 1-800-227-1376.
Canceling an extension
Canceling Due Date Extension may only be done by fulfilling the terms of the agreement (i.e. paying your balance by your extended due date). You may pay off your total balance at any time before your extended due date.
Request an extension online












Payment Arrangement
Enrolling in Payment Arrangement allows you to pay a total bill in smaller increments over a set period of time. There is no fee for enrolling in the program. You can enroll in Payment Arrangement online via your Vectren.com account or by contacting a representative using our Live Chat service or by calling 1-800-227-1376.
Once you are enrolled, you must pay your bi-weekly installments by the due dates displayed on your monthly Vectren bill. In addition, you must pay the current charges on your monthly Vectren bill by the due date provided on that bill. Failure to meet both requirements will automatically break the arrangement, and you will be required to pay the entire account balance immediately to avoid service disconnection.
Canceling an arrangement
Canceling Payment Arrangement may only be done by fulfilling the terms of the agreement (i.e. paying each installment in-full and on-time). You may pay off your total balance at any time during the term of your arrangement.
Request arrangement online
















Manage your options online by registering your free Vectren.com account.
All you need is your Vectren account number and a valid email address.com. Get started

Vectren's regulated subsidiaries deliver gas and/or electricity to more than one million customers in adjoining service territories that cover two-thirds of Indiana and west central Ohio.

Vectren North provides energy delivery services to 580,000 natural gas customers located in central and southern Indiana. Vectren South provides energy delivery services to 144,000 electric customers and 111,000 gas customers located in southwestern Indiana.

VEDO provides energy delivery services to approximately 314,000 natural gas customers located in west central Ohio.
Vectren's electric customers are served by a mixed portfolio of 1,000 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation and up to 245 MW of gas-fired generation, along with 3 MW from a landfill gas to electric project and 80 MW of wind power. Also, purchases from the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC) of up to 32 MW and additional load from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) power pool occasionally supplement Vectren load requirements.

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]




Vectren's Riverfront Headquarters in Downtown Evansville.


In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]

In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]

In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

The Ice Pique Polo is a favorite look for the way it combines moisture-wicking, 100% polyester mesh fabric with understated touches of style.  The forward shoulders, open sleeves, fully-taped neck seam, machine-washable style, and 4.5 ounce weight create a polo that allows movement for active lives.  The added features of a three-button placket, back half moon, and rib knit collar detailing help make this polo a preferred piece. Embroidered with the Vectren logo on left chest.All logowear items are custom orders.  All sales are final.  No exchanges or returns.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]




Vectren's Riverfront Headquarters in Downtown Evansville.


In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]




Vectren's Riverfront Headquarters in Downtown Evansville.


In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

History[edit]
The company was formed from the merger of Indiana Gas Company (formed 1941) and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (SIGECO, formed 1912). The two utilities' holding companies, Indiana Energy and SIGCORP, announced plans to merge in June 1999, and received final approval on March 9, 2000. In the fall of 2000, Vectren also acquired the natural gas distribution assets of Dayton Power and Light in western Ohio. In the fall of 2006, the company purchased Duke Energy's interest in Miller Pipeline.[4]

In a 2010 reorganization, Indiana Gas was renamed Vectren North, while SIGECO was renamed Vectren South.
Utilities[edit]
Vectren's largest subsidiary, Vectren Utility Holdings, oversees Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - North (Vectren North—the former Indiana Gas), Vectren Energy Delivery of Indiana - South (Vectren South—the former SIGECO) and Vectren Energy Delivery of Ohio (VEDO).
Vectren provides natural gas to 680,000 customers in Indiana (570,000 in central Indiana and 110,000 in southwestern Indiana) and 314,000 customers in Ohio.[5] It provides electricity to 142,000 customers in southwestern Indiana.[6]
Nonutility Subsidiaries and Affiliates[edit]
Vectren's nonutility group consists of three divisions Infrastructure Services, Energy Services, and Coal Mining.[7] Vectren also operates a nonprofit foundation, the Vectren Foundation, which provides assistance for community development and energy efficiency projects.[8]
Sponsorships[edit]
Vectren sponsors the radio network of the Indianapolis Colts NFL football team; the network is referred to on-air as the "Vectren Radio Network". Vectren also sponsors the annual "Vectren Dayton Air Show"
Finance[edit]
On Jan 29, 2003, Vectren restated its 2001 earnings. As a result of adjustments related to gas and employee benefit costs, 2001 earnings previously reported were reduced by 18 cents per share.[9] Vectren has installed the Healthcare Bluebook and Grand Rounds to reduce employee healthcare cost inflation.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
