thereof to fill such vacancy shall be, and the Company shall use
its best efforts to cause such vacancy to be filled, as soon as
possible, by a new designee of the Blackstone Designator, and the
Company shall take, to the fullest extent permitted by law, at any
time and from time to time, all actions necessary to accomplish the
same.

(d) The Company shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, include in the slate of nominees
recommended by the Board at any meeting of stockholders called for
the purpose of electing directors, the persons designated pursuant
to this Section 2.1 and use its reasonable best efforts to cause

provided herein, recommending such individual’s election and
