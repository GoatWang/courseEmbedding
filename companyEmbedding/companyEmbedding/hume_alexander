  General Notes: 
The marriage of Alexander Hume and Sarah Page is deduced from the will of John Page, Prince William Co. Will Book C, Virginia State Library, and Fauquier Co. of 1790 and 1799, and deeds settling the John Page estate, Fauquier Co. Deed Books 10, pg. 229, and 14, pg. 457.Frances Hubbard is believed to have had a son who adopted the name Hubbard Hume after her marriage to Alexander Hume. A 1785 land deed to Hubbard Hume was witnessed by Alexander Hume (Prince William Co. Deed Book W, pg. 308). Hubbard Hume was a private in Benjamin Harrison's regiment of the Fauquier County Militia in 1777. He died in Morgan County, Virginia (now West Virginia), and in his will dated 25 March 1833 (Morgan County Wills pg. 286) named his heirs: Margaret Hume, wife; Bethsheba Smith, and Nancy Elizabeth, James, Hubbard, Peter, John, William, Margarett (sic) and Catherine Hume. Five of the latter eight were married, but the married names were not given. Charles Hume was a witness to the will.There is no documentation that Alexander Hume of Grainger Co., Tenn., was a son of Alexander Hume of Spotsylvania Co., Virginia, but the evidence cited above strongly supports the assumption.All children listed, all believed to have been children by Frances Hubbard, are named in Alexander Hume's will.[A Hume Chronicle, Andrew Hume of Fauquier County, Virginia   His Scottish Heritage and American Descendants, (1982) by O.

The son of Patrick, 5th Lord Polwarth, he was educated at the University of St. Andrews and on the Continent.[1] He was originally destined for the law, but devoted himself to the service of the church, and became minister of Logie in Stirlingshire.

HOME or HUME, Sir ALEXANDER (d. 1456), of Home, warden of the marches, was the eldest son of Sir Alexander Home of Dunglass, by Jean, daughter of Sir William Hay of Locharret. His father was killed at the battle of Verneuil on 17 Aug. 1424. The family were relatives and feudatories of the earls of Dunbar and March, but on the forfeiture of that family in 1435 became manorial tenants of the crown. They then succeeded in some degree to the position they previously help by their chiefs, and gradually they acquired an authority and influence greater than that formerly wielded by them. Sir Alexander had a charter of part of the barony of Home or Hume, 4 Sept. 1439; of the office of balliary of Coldingham in 1442; of the lands of Lamben in Berwickshire, and the office of sheriff depute of the county of Berwick for life from John Halyburton, 3 Jan. 1447-8. In 1449 he was one of the guarantors of a treaty with England, and warden of the marches (Rymer, Fœdera, xi. 253). On 9 Nov. 1450 he had a safe-conduct abroad with William, eighth earl of Douglas [q. v.], when the latter paid a visit to Rome (Cal. Documents relating to Scotl. iv. Entry 1229), and on 23 April of the following year he had another safe-conduct for a year with the earl (ib. 1232). On 20 June of this latter year Home founded the collegiate church of Dunglass, for a provost and several prebendaries, and endowed it with lands in Chirnside, the charter being confirmed by the king on 22 Aug. (Reg. Mag. Sig. Scotl. i. entry 389). He was one of the envoys sent by the Scottish king, 27 July of the same year, to treat for a truce with England (Cal. Documents relating to Scotl. iv. 1235), and on 14 Aug. concluded a truce for three years (ib. 1239). On the threatened invasion of Scotland in 1453 by Percy, earl of Northumberland, accompanied by James, ninth earl of Douglas, Home was provided with victuals and shafts of lances for the defence of the house of Home at a cost of 20l. (Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, iv. 607). He died in 1456. By his wife Mariota, daughter of Sir Robert Lauder of Bass, he had five sons, of whom the eldest, Alexander (d. 1491) [q. v.], succeeded him.

HUME, ALEXANDER (1811–1859), Scottish poet and musical composer, was born in Edinburgh, 7 Feb. 1811. After receiving an elementary education he worked for a time at cabinet-making. Early recognised as a singer, he became tenor in St. Paul's episcopal church, and chorus-master in the Theatre Royal. He devoted much of his leisure to reading. While still young he was associated with the Glassites, and it is likely that the arrangement of their musical manual was his earliest work as a musician.
About 1855 Hume settled in Glasgow, where he worked at his trade, and increased his poetical and musical reputation. He frequently contributed lyrics to the Edinburgh 'Scottish Press,' and in 1856 he edited the 'Lyric Gems of Scotland' (Glasgow), to which he made over fifty contributions of his own, providing in several cases both words and music, while in others he merely supplied the music or arranged previous compositions. It is not certain that the valuable annotations in the work are Hume's, but it is probable that he had a share in them. Hume married, in 1829, Margaret Leys, who bore him seven children, and predeceased him in 1848. He died 4 Feb. 1859, and was buried in Glasgow necropolis.
Although self-taught in musical theory, Hume was very successful in setting tunes both to standard Scottish lyrics and songs of his own. He has composed an appropriate melody to Burns's 'Afton Water;' his own pathetic lyric, 'My ain dear Nell,' has simple emotional fervour and tuneful grace. In concerted pieces he likewise earned distinction, his glees 'We Fairies come,' `Tell me where my Love reposes,' and others, evincing excellent taste and harmonious effect. There is no collected edition of his works, but several of the songs and glees included in the 'Lyric Gems' maintain their popularity.
[Information from Hume's son, Mr. William Hume, Pollokshields; Irving's Eminent Scotsmen.]

About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 

A touchstone of the Enlightenment dispute between rationality and religious belief, David Hume’s essay “Of Miracles” has elicited much commentary from proponents and critics ever since it was published over 250 years ago. Alexander George’s lucid and sustained interpretation of Hume’s essay provides fresh insights into this provocative, occasionally elusive, and always subtle text. The Everlasting Check will be read with interest by both students new to Hume and seasoned scholars.
George does justice to the letter and spirit of Hume’s essay, explaining the concepts and claims involved, making intelligible the essay’s structure, and clarifying remarks that have long puzzled readers. Properly interpreted, the essay’s central philosophical argument proves to be much hardier than Hume’s detractors suggest. George considers a range of objections to Hume—some recent, some perennial—and shows why most fail, either because they are based on misinterpretations or because the larger body of Hume’s philosophy answers them.
Beyond an analysis and defense of Hume’s essay, George also offers a critique of his own, appealing to Ludwig Wittgenstein’s thoughts on magic and ritual to demonstrate that Hume misconstrues the character of religious belief and its relationship to evidence and confirmation. Raising a host of important questions about the connection between religious and empirically verified beliefs, George discusses why Hume’s master argument can fail to engage with committed religious thought and why philosophical argumentation in general often proves ineffective in shaking people’s deeply held beliefs.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…
