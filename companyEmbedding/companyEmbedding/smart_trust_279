The market for smart homes was valued at USD 54.97 Billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.61% between 2017 and 2023. The key drivers contributing to the growth of this market include significant advancements in the IoT market; increasing need of the consumer for convenience, safety, and security; and rising need for energy saving and low carbon emission-oriented solutions.
The smart home market, on the basis of product, has been segmented into lighting control, security & access control, HVAC control, entertainment & other controls, home healthcare, smart kitchen, and home appliances. Lighting control held the largest share of the smart home in 2016. The growth of this market can be attributed to the capability of lighting control to reduce electricity consumption in homes as the sensors adjust the intensity of artificial light according to the intensity of natural light. Entertainment has become an important part of life as it provides relaxation and rejuvenation. The most important feature of entertainment control is the ability to integrate multi-room entertainment systems. The major controls used to control and regulate the entertainment systems in smart homes are audio, volume, and multimedia room controls. The growth of the market for audio, volume, & multimedia room controls is driven by the convenience offered by these controls for managing as well controlling the entertainment systems within a house. The advancements in wireless communication technologies is a major factor boosting the growth of the market for home theater system controls, thereby driving the overall market for entertainment controls.
North America held the largest share of the global smart home market in 2016, owing to the factors such as increasing demand for reliable home energy management systems, enhanced home security levels, and growing popularity of integration of smart devices such as tablets and smartphones in smart home solutions. The smart home in Asia Pacific is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period. actors such as the strong economic growth, increasing population and improving standards of living, and rapid urbanization leading to a sophisticated infrastructure are driving the growth of the market in this region. South Korea held the largest size of the smart home in APAC in 2016. However, with the growth of the smart home industry and large-scale implementation of smart home system hardware and software solutions in China and Japan, the market in these countries is expected to grow at a higher rate than the market in South Korea during the forecast period. APAC is considered as a huge market for smart homes because of the considerable rate of implementation of various products such as lighting controls and HVAC controls in the region.

Several smart home products have reached their maturity stage in certain regions. Most of the residents in regions such as Europe and North America have been using smart thermostats, smart meters, HVAC controls, and lighting controls for a long time. As the switching cost of these products is high, consumers do not replace them soon after installation. This acts as a restraint for the market growth.
Some of the major companies profiled in the report are Siemens AG (Germany), United Technologies Corporation (US), General Electric Company (US), Schneider Electric (France), Honeywell International, Inc.  (US), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (Ireland), Johnson Controls, Inc.  (US), ABB Ltd.  (Switzerland), Legrand S.A. (France), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (South Korea), Acuity Brands, Inc. (US),  Lutron Electronics Co. Inc. (US), and Leviton Manufacturing Company, Inc. (US).

Frequently Asked Questions






             Installation and configuration



I get an error during installation.


















To solve errors like:


"Unrecognized USB device"

"Device driver software was not successfully installed"

"Can not find driver"

Please follow the installation trouble shooting guide.







         Usage



The characters on the keyboard don't correspond to the characters that I type on the TV. How can I change the lay-out?


















Make sure that the keyboard is supporting this layout (e.g. you have a keyboard with a UK layout and you would like to use it on your TV with a German (DE) layout. In this case, the characters on the screen will not correspond with the keyboard.) 
your TV is supporting this language and language is selected in your smart TV as an input language(s). 

The steps to change the language layout vary per TV brand / model.
You can usually find this in the settings on your TV, such as:
Menu -System > Device Manager > Keyboard settings > Options Keyboard > Keyboard Language
However, per brand / model, the above naming can be different.


See an example of how to set the input language layout correctly for a Samsung Smart TV on 
YouTube.




Is it required to turn off the product to save power?


















This product has advanced power saving features.
Turning off the product by removing the batteries is not required, but optional.







         Solving problems



I get the wrong letters and/or symbols when typing on my computer.


















Set the correct language as explained in the keyboard settings page




Sometimes letters are missing when typing.



















Clean your keyboard from dust and crumbles.
If you are using it with a TV, make sure that your TV and/or the app, supports all symbols and characters of the keyboard.

Improve wireless performance.
See wireless troubleshooting page






I have lost/broken the USB-receiver. How do I receive a new USB-receiver?


















It's not possible to provide a replacement receiver for this product.
This is due to the fact that during production the product and receiver receive a unique code, so the product can only communicate with the bundled original receiver.




When I use the YouTube or Netflix app the keyboard is not working properly.


















This keyboard should work with different apps. 

However, there is a known issue with Samsung TV's and keyboards from different brands, and the non-functioning of apps such as YouTube and Netflix

We suggest to contact Samsung for more information and possible solutions. 





My touchpad is not working. What do I do?


















Please make sure that your TV supporting HID mouse and keyboard is recognised by the TV also as HID mouse. 

Please check the properties of your TV to verify how the keyboard is recognised. 




Where is your service center? Or where can I send my product to be repaired?


















Unfortunately, we do not have service centers to repair products.
A defective product should be replaced by your point of purchase during the warranty period.




My Trust product is not working.


















Follow the steps in the trouble shooting guide.




My product is faulty. What do I do?


















We offer a 'return to retailer' warranty on our products.
In case of a defect, you can return the product to your retailer with failure description, proof of purchase and all accessories.
During the warranty period you will receive a replacement product from the retailer if available.

What are UITs?Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are a fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. These types of portfolios allow investors to know what securities are held within a UIT as of the date of deposit, as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust. While it is not common, a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus. UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum, typically liquid investment. As a point of contrast, while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities, thereby changing their investment mix, the securities held in a UIT generally remain fixed.
How are UIT securities chosen?Some UIT securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index. Other UITs are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers, who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics, according to specific objectives. Once securities are selected, the UIT portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust.
Can a security held in a UIT be removed at any time?While it is rare, a security held in a UIT may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances, such as a significant decline in credit rating. By and large, securities held in a UIT remain fixed for the life of the trust, regardless of market value.
What are the minimum investments in SmartTrust® UITs?Typical minimums are 100 units, however, the minimums may vary based on the UIT. Higher minimums may also be required by each respective brokerage firm.
Are UITs suitable for my retirement accounts?Unit trusts may be an appropriate investment vehicle for IRAs or self-employed retirement plans. They offer a variety of investment opportunities — ranging from relatively conservative to more aggressive investments — in both domestic and international markets.
What are my options when a UIT matures?Option #1: Rollover at a reduced sales charge
At a reduced sales charge, investors may roll over into a new series of the same trust, if available, or any other SmartTrust® UIT available in the primary market*
*Maturity rollover is considered a taxable event. Please refer to each trust’s prospectus for complete rollover option information. Investors should be aware that there is a time limit to notify the trustee of the rollover.
Option #2: Maturity
Investors may do nothing and allow the portfolio units to mature. The trust will liquidate and they will receive a cash distribution of the trust’s proceeds, if any.
Option #3: In-kind distribution
Investors may generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units if they own 2,500 or more units at either the time of purchase or maturity. Please see additional provisions set forth in the prospectus. SmartTrust® Unit Investment Trusts are generally long-term investment strategies and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available. Investors should consult their tax advisor to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next, if available. Neither Hennion & Walsh, Inc. or Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, Inc. provide tax advice. Please refer to the trust prospectus for more complete in-kind distribution information. In-kind distribution is generally available for stocks traded and held in the United States. In-kind distribution may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Can I sell my units?You may sell all, or a portion of, your units any day the stock market is open. You will receive the then-current net asset value of the units, based on the current market value of the underlying securities in the portfolio, less any remaining deferred sales charge, as of the evaluation time. As the market fluctuates, of course, so will the value of your units. Therefore, your units may be worth more or less than what you originally paid.
How are UITs priced?UITs are priced at the end of each business day similar to mutual funds. The price is based on the market value of the underlying securities and includes cash and other assets and liabilities held by the trust.
Are UITs eligible in commission and fee/wrap accounts?UITs are available in a sales charge structure for commission accounts as well as for fee/wrap accounts. It is best to check with your individual brokerage firm to see if UITs are eligible for your fee/wrap platform.
Are UITs regulated?Unit investment trusts are one of three basic types of investment company. Investment companies are subject to stringent federal laws and oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is important to note that the SEC does not approve or disapprove of UITs or the securities within a given UIT or pass upon the adequacy of any prospectus for a given UIT. Investment companies are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This federal statute is highly detailed and governs the structure and day-to-day operations of investment companies. Investment companies are also subject to regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, FINRA, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.
