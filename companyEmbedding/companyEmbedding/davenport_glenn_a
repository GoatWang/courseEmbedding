History[edit]




A Krystal restaurant in the French Quarter, New Orleans.


Founded on October 24, 1932, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, during the first years of the Great Depression, entrepreneur Rody Davenport Jr. and partner J. Glenn Sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval, "People would patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean, where they could get a good meal with courteous service at the lowest possible price." The restaurant's first customer, French Jenkins, ordered six "Krystals" and a cup of coffee, all for the price of 35¢, thus proving their theory true.[5]
Davenport had visited White Castle restaurants, taking notes of successful features, before setting forth on his own venture. Davenport and Sherrill set up the first Krystal at the corner of 7th and Cherry Streets in Chattanooga. The first Krystal was a modular building constructed in Chicago and shipped to Chattanooga for final installation. The oldest Krystal still in operation is located on Cherokee Boulevard in Chattanooga's Northshore District. Krystal is the seventh or eighth-oldest hamburger chain in the United States (the oldest being White Castle)[6] and the oldest in the South.
Regarding the origins of the Krystal name, company legend states that Davenport and his wife were riding down a mountain road when Mrs. Mary McGee Davenport saw a lawn ornament in the shape of a crystal ball. While gazing at the lawn ornament, Mrs. Davenport commented that since Davenport and Sherrill felt cleanliness was a cornerstone of the concept, they should name the restaurant Crystal for "clean as a crystal" - yet with a "K" to add a little twist.[6] Krystal's restaurants through the years often sported a crystal ball on the top.




A Krystal restaurant in Calhoun, Georgia.


From the early 1930s through the early 1960s, the chain served much of its food, not in take-out containers, but on inexpensive porcelain dish ware with the "Krystal" moniker. The waiters and waitresses wore white uniforms, and food was offered through counter service. In the 1950s, Krystal opened its first drive through window - which most locations maintain today.[7] A 2013 study of seven fast food franchises found that service at Krystal drive throughs was the slowest, with an average wait time of 218 seconds. It was, however the most accurate in terms of fulfilling orders.[8]
In the 1950s, cake doughnuts were served as a breakfast and dessert item. From about 1970 until 1986, "bone-in" kettle fried chicken and related sides were offered. These items were sometimes sold from a stand-alone addition to the hamburger restaurants.
DavCo, a division of Krystal, operated Wendy's franchises in the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1983 and 1988, DavCo also operated the Po' Folks family restaurant chain.[9]
Current business[edit]
Krystal restaurants, both company-owned and franchised, operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. There is also a Krystal in Bristol, Virginia, (which lies on the Tennessee-Virginia border), one in West Memphis, Arkansas (directly across the Mississippi River from Memphis, Tennessee), and one in Murphy, North Carolina. Krystal has also operated several restaurants in Texas over the years. Krystal is often compared to the Midwestern restaurant chain White Castle, and other than the South Central Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee markets, the two restaurants' market areas do not generally overlap.
Krystal maintained its corporate headquarters in Chattanooga from 1932 to 2013, and has been owned by Argonne Capital Group since early 2012. Previously, Port Royal Holdings, Inc. owned the chain from 1997-2012, expanding the chain to a peak of over 420 locations in 11 states in 2002, before downsizing and closing dozens of locations. Ten new locations were added in 2011, 11 more in 2012-2013, and 25 more are planned for 2014 throughout the Southeast.
In the late 1990s, Krystal emerged from a bankruptcy proceeding and a sale of assets that placed majority ownership outside the heirs of the founding families. Krystal's period of structural change and uncertainty in the late 1990s has regenerated into a successfully reborn restaurant chain with reported customer satisfaction and an evolving menu.[citation needed]




A tray of Krystal burgers and french fries


Krystal's product line centers on a square hamburger patty slider with a steamed bun, together with diced onions, pickle, and mustard, and collectively called a "Krystal". Small hot dogs called "pups" are also featured menu items. The chain has occasionally expanded its menu to include larger burgers, such as the "Big Angus Burger," a full-size hamburger made of 100% Angus beef.
Krystal is known for a diverse breakfast menu, which includes a made-to-order country breakfast, meat and egg sandwiches, and biscuits, as well as other items. One particularly popular breakfast item is the Scrambler, which includes a layered stack of scrambled eggs, sausage, grits, and cheese served in a styrofoam cup.[10] Other variations of the Scrambler also feature pancakes, sausage gravy, or southwestern-style spices.
In 1998, Krystal introduced the Krystal Chik, a fried chicken breast filet slider served on the signature steamed square bun.[7] Krystal Chiks are extremely popular, along with other chicken, chili, and dessert items. Krystal continues to focus on their core menu products, but is also in the process of redesigning and upgrading their stores to appeal to a mobile and multi-tasking audience.
In the mid 2000s Krystal tested a prototype for a new high-tech drive-in featuring individual television monitors for ordering and watching television (audio accessed via car stereo), and indoor and outdoor seating areas with multiple big-screen television monitors and free digital jukeboxes.[11] Krystal's website is interactive and supports mobile computing, and the Krystal Locater helps customers fulfill their "Krystal Kraving" wherever they might be in the Southeast.
Competitive eating[edit]




Joey Chestnut ate a record 103 Krystal hamburgers in eight minutes at the Krystal Square Off in 2007 and celebrates with Patrick Bertoletti (Left), "Krystal Kitty", and Bob Shoudt (Right).

History[edit]




A Krystal restaurant in the French Quarter, New Orleans.


Founded on October 24, 1932, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, during the first years of the Great Depression, entrepreneur Rody Davenport Jr. and partner J. Glenn Sherrill theorized that even in a severe economic upheaval, "People would patronize a restaurant that was kept spotlessly clean, where they could get a good meal with courteous service at the lowest possible price." The restaurant's first customer, French Jenkins, ordered six "Krystals" and a cup of coffee, all for the price of 35¢, thus proving their theory true.[5]
Davenport had visited White Castle restaurants, taking notes of successful features, before setting forth on his own venture. Davenport and Sherrill set up the first Krystal at the corner of 7th and Cherry Streets in Chattanooga. The first Krystal was a modular building constructed in Chicago and shipped to Chattanooga for final installation. The oldest Krystal still in operation is located on Cherokee Boulevard in Chattanooga's Northshore District. Krystal is the seventh or eighth-oldest hamburger chain in the United States (the oldest being White Castle)[6] and the oldest in the South.
Regarding the origins of the Krystal name, company legend states that Davenport and his wife were riding down a mountain road when Mrs. Mary McGee Davenport saw a lawn ornament in the shape of a crystal ball. While gazing at the lawn ornament, Mrs. Davenport commented that since Davenport and Sherrill felt cleanliness was a cornerstone of the concept, they should name the restaurant Crystal for "clean as a crystal" - yet with a "K" to add a little twist.[6] Krystal's restaurants through the years often sported a crystal ball on the top.




A Krystal restaurant in Calhoun, Georgia.


From the early 1930s through the early 1960s, the chain served much of its food, not in take-out containers, but on inexpensive porcelain dish ware with the "Krystal" moniker. The waiters and waitresses wore white uniforms, and food was offered through counter service. In the 1950s, Krystal opened its first drive through window - which most locations maintain today.[7] A 2013 study of seven fast food franchises found that service at Krystal drive throughs was the slowest, with an average wait time of 218 seconds. It was, however the most accurate in terms of fulfilling orders.[8]
In the 1950s, cake doughnuts were served as a breakfast and dessert item. From about 1970 until 1986, "bone-in" kettle fried chicken and related sides were offered. These items were sometimes sold from a stand-alone addition to the hamburger restaurants.
DavCo, a division of Krystal, operated Wendy's franchises in the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1983 and 1988, DavCo also operated the Po' Folks family restaurant chain.[9]
Current business[edit]
Krystal restaurants, both company-owned and franchised, operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. There is also a Krystal in Bristol, Virginia, (which lies on the Tennessee-Virginia border), one in West Memphis, Arkansas (directly across the Mississippi River from Memphis, Tennessee), and one in Murphy, North Carolina. Krystal has also operated several restaurants in Texas over the years. Krystal is often compared to the Midwestern restaurant chain White Castle, and other than the South Central Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee markets, the two restaurants' market areas do not generally overlap.
Krystal maintained its corporate headquarters in Chattanooga from 1932 to 2013, and has been owned by Argonne Capital Group since early 2012. Previously, Port Royal Holdings, Inc. owned the chain from 1997-2012, expanding the chain to a peak of over 420 locations in 11 states in 2002, before downsizing and closing dozens of locations. Ten new locations were added in 2011, 11 more in 2012-2013, and 25 more are planned for 2014 throughout the Southeast.
In the late 1990s, Krystal emerged from a bankruptcy proceeding and a sale of assets that placed majority ownership outside the heirs of the founding families. Krystal's period of structural change and uncertainty in the late 1990s has regenerated into a successfully reborn restaurant chain with reported customer satisfaction and an evolving menu.[citation needed]




A tray of Krystal burgers and french fries


Krystal's product line centers on a square hamburger patty slider with a steamed bun, together with diced onions, pickle, and mustard, and collectively called a "Krystal". Small hot dogs called "pups" are also featured menu items. The chain has occasionally expanded its menu to include larger burgers, such as the "Big Angus Burger," a full-size hamburger made of 100% Angus beef.
Krystal is known for a diverse breakfast menu, which includes a made-to-order country breakfast, meat and egg sandwiches, and biscuits, as well as other items. One particularly popular breakfast item is the Scrambler, which includes a layered stack of scrambled eggs, sausage, grits, and cheese served in a styrofoam cup.[10] Other variations of the Scrambler also feature pancakes, sausage gravy, or southwestern-style spices.
In 1998, Krystal introduced the Krystal Chik, a fried chicken breast filet slider served on the signature steamed square bun.[7] Krystal Chiks are extremely popular, along with other chicken, chili, and dessert items. Krystal continues to focus on their core menu products, but is also in the process of redesigning and upgrading their stores to appeal to a mobile and multi-tasking audience.
In the mid 2000s Krystal tested a prototype for a new high-tech drive-in featuring individual television monitors for ordering and watching television (audio accessed via car stereo), and indoor and outdoor seating areas with multiple big-screen television monitors and free digital jukeboxes.[11] Krystal's website is interactive and supports mobile computing, and the Krystal Locater helps customers fulfill their "Krystal Kraving" wherever they might be in the Southeast.
Competitive eating[edit]




Joey Chestnut ate a record 103 Krystal hamburgers in eight minutes at the Krystal Square Off in 2007 and celebrates with Patrick Bertoletti (Left), "Krystal Kitty", and Bob Shoudt (Right).


Krystal restaurants are the host of the Krystal Square Off, a competitive eating contest. The current world record is 103 Krystal burgers consumed in 8 minutes by Joey Chestnut, set at the 2007 competition.

Glenn Davenport's Legacy: Keeping Up with Change







 

By Karen WeisbergApril 14, 2006When a shift from cost-plus to P&L in healthcare foodservice demanded a retail mindset, Morrison head led the charge.

Glenn Davenport’s 33 Years at Morrison

1973: Joined Morrison’s Restaurants Inc.

1982-’86: Served as managing director of  Saudi Arabia Morrison

1994: Named president of Morrison’s Healthcare Division

1996: Named ceo of Morrison Healthcare (a separate corporation)

2000: Awarded IFMA’s Silver Plate Award, Healthcare

2001: Remained ceo when Compass Group acquired Morrison Healthcare

2006: Retires after 33 years
Morrison Management Specialists will achieve sales in excess of $1 billion this year, according to Glenn Davenport, president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta-based division of Compass Group Americas Division. That sales volume translates to $1.6 billion in managed volume, he adds—making now a perfect time to “go out with a winning season,” in his words.
Davenport will retire August 31st at the relatively young age of 52. Timing—not to mention hard work—has been central to his 33-year career at Morrison, and he has never lost sight of his down-home roots no matter how high-powered his business acumen and responsibilities have grown.
He joined Morrison’s parent company, Morrison’s Restaurants Inc., in 1973, and has held a variety of management positions throughout the organization. In 1982, he served as managing director of Saudi Arabia Morrison.
Fast track: Davenport returned to the U.S. with the title of U.S. regional vice president in 1986; he was later promoted to senior vice president of the Hospitality Group; and then became president of the Healthcare Division in 1994. He was named chief executive officer after Morrison Healthcare became a separate corporation in March, 1996, and remained in that position through the Compass Group acquisition of Morrison in 2001.
At that time, having won the IFMA Silver Plate 2000 award in healthcare—and having made a three-year commitment to Compass—Davenport began to think seriously about what he’d like to do with the rest of his life.
Hearing this leader of industry recalling his audacious entrance upon the Morrison scene provides a sense of how he’s come so far and where he might chose to direct his efforts in the future.
Taking aim: “When I was 20 years old, I was going to college, married and had a child on the way—I was poor, hungry and needed money,” he recalls. “There was a man at church who always wore a three-piece suit and drove a Cadillac. I asked around and learned that he was John Hill and he worked for Morrison Cafeterias. I couldn’t figure how he made a lot of money working in the cafeteria in town, but I thought I’d ask him for a job and perhaps become as successful as he evidently was.”
Warming to his story, Davenport continues. “One night he pulled up in the church parking lot and I went over to him and said, ‘Mr. Hill, you’ve known my family all my life. I’m looking for a job.’ He said, ‘It involves long hours, hard work, and I don’t think you can do it.’ During the week, the more I thought about what he’d said, the madder I got.
“The next weekend, I waited for him in the parking lot and, when he got out of his car I said, ‘If you can do it, I can do it!’ Mr. Hill laughed and said he was hoping I was going to say that, and I should be at his office downtown in the First National Bank building Monday morning. I was surprised his office wasn’t in the Morrison Cafeteria, but I soon found out he was president of the institutional division of Morrison and those were the folks I interviewed with.”
Davenport began as a management trainee in a Morrison Healthcare Division storeroom at a time when the company operated 50 cafeterias and about 50 institutional accounts. “The institutional division was the ‘stepchild’ since Morrison Cafeteria management thought that running foodservice in hospitals was a piece of cake,” he explains.
When Morrison bought Ruby Tuesday—a chain of about 12 or 14 locations—in 1982, the division slipped to third place in management’s estimation, behind Morrison Cafeterias and Ruby Tuesday, and the time seemed right for an infusion of new ideas in the Healthcare Division. Davenport, named president of the Morrison Healthcare Division in 1994, was full of plans and, two years later, boldly took Morrison Healthcare public.
“We had about $225 million in sales and about 3,000 employees—this year we have about 15,000,” Davenport says. “We were a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange for about five years prior to our acquisition by Compass in April 2001. When we went public, everything we did affected our stock price. Therefore we grew up faster and worked better.”
Today, the Senior Dining Division serves about 450 accounts with approximately $350 million in gross annual revenues, while Morrison Healthcare Division has about 500 locations and about $650 million in gross annual sales.
Retail mindset: When Davenport began with the company, hospital foodservice was a cost-plus business—the facility passed along expenses to the government or to insurance companies. With the advent of diagnostic related groups (DRGs) came a price freeze that impacted the way Davenport’s company needed to do business in order to continue to grow.
“Capitated [fixed] prices meant the priorities of our clients changed,” he explains. “Prior to DRGs, it was management fee, but today 80% to 90% of accounts are profit-and-loss; therefore we have to have a retail mindset. Today, you have to know what your costs are and be able to read a P&L statement.
“Plus, you must have a customer mindset,” he continues. “After all, we get hired to reduce the clients’ cost and to improve patient satisfaction.”
Changing of the guard: When Davenport retires this summer, Scott MacLellan, founder of Foodbuy (now a purchasing arm of Compass Group) will take over the helm. He will report to Rick Postiglione, ceo of contract foodservices at Compass. Brothers Michael and Kevin Svagdis will become president of Morrison Healthcare and Morrison Senior Dining, respectively.
Davenport, meanwhile, will continue to work on a talk radio show he helped launch in January. “I still want freedom over my schedule—that was my main reason for retirement,” he adds.”

Play up items that fit restricted diets

We started advertising our chicken wings as halal wings with assorted sauces. Our inspiration was to inform customers of an option that was available but not widely known. By changing our approach to our marketing efforts, we were able to exponentially increase participation in the consumption of our halal menu items.

When catering goes wrong

While catering a wedding for a previous employer years ago, Rahul Shrivastav—now director of catering at University of Michigan—found himself in a panic when an elevator malfunction put salad service on hold. “The wedding was in a very old building and the elevator had issues,” he says. “We had 200 plated salads in the freight elevator when it got stuck. The dinner needed to start—they were doing their toasts.” In a panic, Shrivastav hustled up a plan B: His team would station a chef outside the ballroom, and he’d plate new salads right there.  Luckily, the elevator was fixed in...




Ideas and Innovation
The industry that never sleeps

Aside from Black Friday shoppers, there may be no crowd of people more eager to get to their bounty than wedding guests headed for the passed appetizers. While they’re surely thrilled for the bride and groom, that feeling comes second to the thrill of landing that first shrimp skewer—especially after a long ceremony. Same goes for work-related cocktail parties. Caught up in an awkward conversation? Oh look, it’s the mini-grilled cheese guy!  This month, FoodService Director takes a deep dive into catering, from the latest and greatest in menus to starting a new program at your...




Ideas and Innovation
Devein shrimp in a snap

In an interview with Bon Appetit magazine, Victor Clay, a line cook at Nobu Dallas in Texas, reveals his two simple tricks to prep an average of 15 to 20 shrimp per minute.  First, use kitchen shears to split the back of the shrimp. Then, before removing the vein, run the shrimp under cold water, which will loosen the vein. This cuts down on cleaning time, and prevents cooks from having to soak and rinse the shrimp afterward.

Glenn A. Davenport
GLENN A. DAVENPORT serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Morrison Management Specialists, Inc. Employed by Morrison’s former
parent company, Morrison Restaurants Inc., since 1973, Mr. Davenport has
held a diversity of management positions within the organization. His
career began with a job as a management trainee at a Morrison-managed
account. Leaving college to accept the position, Mr. Davenport worked as
a Food Service Director and District Manager during the first part of
this tenure. In 1982, he moved to the Middle East to serve as the
Managing Director of Saudi Arabian Morrison, the company’s joint venture
to manage the food service needs for the country’s Ministry of Health
and Ministry of Defense and Aviation. Mr. Davenport returned to the
United States as a Regional Vice President in 1986. He was later
promoted to Senior Vice President of the company’s Hospitality Group,
which provided food services to healthcare, education, and business and
industry accounts. When Morrison sold its education and industry
accounts in 1994, Mr. Davenport became President of the Healthcare
Division. He was named Chief Executive Officer after Morrison Health
Care became a separate corporation in March 1996. Mr. Davenport is
recognized by Nation’s Restaurant News as one of the 50 power players in
the restaurant industry. He has also been the recipient of several
prestigious awards, most recently winning the Silver Plate 2000 award
