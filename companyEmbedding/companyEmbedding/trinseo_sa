Trinseo S.A. Key Developments

Trinseo Offers Polymers, Specialty Engineered Solutions for Drug Delivery Devices
Jul 11 17
Trinseo announced that its Consumer Essential Markets (CEM) business unit will now support medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers of Drug Delivery Devices with specialty engineered polymer solutions. Typical drug delivery devices, also known as combination devices that can use Trinseo materials include auto injectors, insulin pens, asthma inhalers, prefilled syringes and wearable devices. The company’s specialty compounded solutions are ideal for a wide range of applications – acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) for housings, polycarbonate (PC) for windows and needle shield caps, and polystyrene (PS) for secondary packaging. Trinseo materials are offered under the brands CALIBRE™ Polycarbonate Resins, CALIBRE™ MEGARAD™ Polycarbonate Resins, EMERGE™ Advanced Resins, STYRON™ Polystyrene Resins and MAGNUM™ ABS Resins. They provide advantages which are critical to the market such as: Appearance and color options; High impact resistance and toughness; High stiffness/modulus; Low residual monomer and oligomer levels; Radiation and Ethylene Oxide sterilization; and Biocompatiblity tested resins and colors. Trinseo materials have been developed to meet the needs of manufacturers and molders - and they can be customized to meet exacting specifications. Trinseo medical grades have been biocompatibility tested and certain products are listed on a U.S. FDA Master Access File or Drug Master File. The company’s focus on drug delivery devices expands its support in the Medical Devices space which has included Single- and Multiple-Use Devices and Equipment Housings. As healthcare professionals embrace self-administered care they need devices that not only are effective therapeutically but also offer their patients functionality, convenience, haptics and aesthetics. Polymers are a big part of the challenge and Trinseo, with a foundation in medical polymers, intends to offer the solution.

Conclusion
The rating on TSE is neutral.

To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.
Business
TSE is a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of emulsion polymers and plastics, including various specialty and technologically differentiated products.
TSE has leading market positions in many of the markets in which it competes. TSE believes it has developed these strong market positions due to its technological differentiation, diverse global manufacturing base, long-standing customer relationships, commitment to sustainable solutions and competitive cost positions.
TSE believes that growth in overall consumer spending and construction activity, increased demand in the automotive industry for higher fuel efficiency and lighter-weight materials, and improving living standards in emerging markets will result in growth in the global markets in which TSE competes.
In addition, TSE believes its increasing business presence in developing regions such as China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe further enhances its prospects.
TSE develops emulsion polymers and plastics products that are incorporated into a wide range of its customers' products throughout the world, including tires and other products for automotive applications, carpet and artificial turf backing, coated paper and packaging board, food service packaging, appliances, medical devices, consumer electronics and construction applications, among others.
TSE seeks to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by its strong patent portfolio, designed to enhance its customers' product offerings.
TSE has long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on TSE for formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find sustainable solutions for their businesses.
Many of its products represent only a small portion of a finished product's production costs, but provide critical functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to customer specifications.

TSE believes these product traits result in substantial customer loyalty for its products.
TSE has significant manufacturing and production operations around the world, which allows it to serve its global customer base.
As of March 31, 2014, TSE's production facilities included 35 manufacturing plants (which included a total of 83 production units) at 27 sites across 14 countries, including joint ventures and contract manufacturers.
TSE's manufacturing locations include sites in high-growth emerging markets such as China, Indonesia and Brazil. Additionally, as of March 31, 2014 TSE operated 11 research and development ("R&D") facilities globally, including mini plants, development centers and pilot coaters, which TSE believes are critical to its global presence and innovation capabilities.
Seasonality
Quarterly results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonality of the business.
Seasonal changes and weather conditions typically affect the construction and building materials end markets.
In particular, sales volumes for construction and building materials generally rise in the warmer months and generally decline during the colder months of fall and winter.
Abnormally cold or wet seasons may cause reduced purchases from our construction and building materials customers and, therefore, adversely affect our financial results.
However, because seasonal weather patterns are difficult to predict, TSE cannot accurately estimate fluctuations in quarterly construction and building materials sales in any given year.
Because of the seasonality of the business, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
Dividend Policy
No dividends are planned.
Intellectual Property
TSE owns over 250 patents and has over 200 pending patent applications in various jurisdictions throughout the world covering processes and technology such as material formulations, material process technology and various end-use industrial applications for its materials.

Competition
TSE's principal competitors in its Synthetic Rubber segment include Asahi Kasei Corporation, JSR Corporation, Lanxess AG, Zeon Corporation, Versalis S.p.A and Synthos S.A.
In its Synthetic Rubber segment, TSE competes primarily based on its ability to offer differentiated products, the reliability of its products, the quality of its customer service and the length and depth of its relationships.

Use of proceeds
TSE expects to net $161 million from its IPO. Proceeds are allocated as follows:
To redeem $132.5 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under its 8.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.
The remaining proceeds will be used to pay fees and expenses associated with this offering and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

        This is Trinseo
    

			Trinseo is a global chemical materials solutions provider and a manufacturer of plastics, latex binders, and synthetic rubber.


Trinseo focuses on delivering innovative and sustainable solutions to help our customers create products that are intrinsic to how we live – products that touch lives every day across a wide range of end-markets.
We are passionately dedicated to helping our customers meet their most complex materials challenges – whether they are creating electronics that are thinner and lighter… or cars that weigh less and use less fuel. Our plastics enable manufacturers to create LED lighting that is brighter and cooler and reduces energy consumption … and medical devices that are impervious to the harsh chemical cleansers used in sterilization. Our synthetic rubber allows tire manufacturers to make high-performance tires with low rolling resistance and improved wet grip for greater fuel efficiency. And, our latex binders enable manufacturers to deliver tailored solutions that enhance packaging materials and help highway infrastructure last longer.
Our global footprint – with 15 manufacturing sites and 10 research and development facilities globally – gives us the ability to respond quickly to our customers’ needs, no matter where in the world they are.

Modifier A™ / NA Binder for Concrete Modification







        Modifier A™ / NA Binder for Concrete Modification
    

			Modifier A™ / NA Latex from Trinseo is a concrete modifier that offers a wealth of advantageous features and benefits for the construction industry.
		

Trinseo’s Modifier A™ / NA Latex is a concrete modifier manufactured to meet latex specifications and concrete performance requirements of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Each shipment is accompanied by a letter certifying conformance to Report No. FHWA-RD-78-35, “Styrene-butadiene Latex Modifiers for Bridge Deck Overlay Concrete.“
Modifier A™ / NA Latex offers a unique combination of properties that result in superior performance and value compared with alternatives. Features include:

Compatible as an admixture to portland cement
Ease of mixing
Excellent adhesion of the overlay to the bridge deck
Good workability at low water-to-cement ratios
Improved wear resistance
Low permeability to protect rebar from corrosion accelerated by deicing salts
Lower cost over the life of the project
Quick curing capability
Reduced crack propagation
Reduced modulus of elasticity (results in reduced brittleness and deck stress)
Reduced shrinkage

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
