Asset Management Services


Asset management services are offered by a number of firms throughout the whole world. These firms allocate funds for the assets, prepare the strategy for asset development and monitor the development of the assets. The basic aim behind these activities is to achieve a definite financial target. 










Asset management companies offer various asset management services for different sectors. These sectors have their own assets and set of expectations from those assets. The risk factor and growth rate of these assets are also different. So it is hard to make a single plan to manage assets for all these sectors. Depending upon the demands of the client and the market conditions, the asset management companies have developed their services.
Features of Asset Management Services
The asset management services for any sector consist of several common features. Some of these features are as follows:

Setting Goals:
There are different kinds of assets like investment instruments, real state property, machineries, computers, different types of technologies and many more. The asset owners expect some specific results from their assets. These expectations are termed as the goals for the future. At times, the asset management companies help their clients to set their goals.
Allocation of Funds:
This is another important factor for the asset management services. If the goals are set, the management company can allocate adequate funds for the assets or can suggest the client to do so. The companies allocate funds according to the growth potentials of the asset.
Strategy:
After analyzing the market condition of particular asset and its development prospects, the strategies are developed. Another important factor that is considered for strategy making is the risk factor. The amount of risk is different for various assets and so proper understanding of the present and potential risk factors is highly necessary. The strategy should have the flexibility to be modified according to the changing scenario.
Strategy Monitoring:
To ensure smooth growth of the assets and to increase the yielding capacity of the asset, it is necessary that the development process and strategy are reviewed at regular intervals and according to the need, alterations are done in the process.

Our business is investment led and centred around a long-term perspective with a dedication to client service. Our aim is to be the investment partner of choice to our clients. This means giving them our undivided attention, offering pioneering strategies and being committed to excellence. 





   . 
Our mission is to build lasting partnerships with our clients by exceeding their expectations for investment performance and service.

                            –
                            Laurent Ramsey, Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer
                        













                            Photograph: Stéphane Couturier for Pictet
                        





Our people




At Pictet Asset Management, our ambition is to attract and retain highly talented individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, and help them to realise their personal and professional goals. We aim to build an entrepreneurial and collegiate atmosphere, allowing ideas to mature, experience to accumulate and our people to reach their full potential.  

We currently have approximately 830 employees of which around a third are investment professionals. Our people are located in 17 offices across the world, close to the markets in which we invest and the clients we serve.                






Our investment focus




We believe in active management with a strong focus on valuation across equity, credit, sovereign debt and currencies. 
As a multi-boutique firm we embrace a variety of investment styles, allowing our teams to implement the best approach for their respective asset classes. Our investment managers operate independently to encourage innovation and accountability, while consistent implementation of their investment philosophy and process is regularly monitored. 
We expect our investment teams to think unconventionally and encourage active dialogue across regions and capital structures. We manage risk as much as portfolios, with risk management an integral part of the decision making process. Our investment managers are able to focus on their primary task of making investment decisions and are supported by a team of product specialists.
Our size, global reach and focused product range differentiates us from our competitors. 





   . 
We always favour clients’ interests over asset growth and do not hesitate to close strategies to protect alpha generation for our investors.

                            –
                            Sébastien Eisinger, Head of Investments
                        

Our investment resources are focused on three distinctive capabilities: 





                        Greater Europe
                    

From our Swiss origins we have established ourselves as a leading European investment specialist, with a natural competitive advantage when investing in the region. We understand the market dynamics, cultural and market nuances, and our close access to companies underpins our ability to invest successfully across the corporate capital structure. 





                        Emerging World
                    

We were among the pioneers in both emerging debt and emerging equity investing. Our offering has grown with the market, starting with equities and hard currency debt, then adding local currency debt and more recently Asia specific and corporate debt strategies. With growing economies, lower debt and positive demographics, emerging markets are poised to overtake the developed world. 





                        Global specialities
                    

We also offer a range of investment strategies that capture long-term trends or aim to benefit from structural changes across sectors and regions. Our beta agnostic thematic equity, multi-asset and absolute return fixed income products lie at the heart of these strategies. Their goal is to provide long-term return potential with diversified risk.                





 .. 
Institutions that have chosen to go for quality, not quantity or growth at all costs, are today the best.

                            –
                            Renaud de Planta, Managing Partner and Chairman
                        








Our commitment to responsible investment




We are convinced that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations can help us make better long-term investment decisions for our clients.
For decades, sustainability has been central to our way of thinking. Since the Pictet Group was founded in 1805, we have aimed to ensure the prosperity of our clients over the long term. In doing so, we have instinctively considered the interests of future generations.
Pictet Asset Management believes in responsible capitalism and takes an enlarged view of the economy and its interactions with civil society and the natural environment.
Consistent with our fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of our clients and our adherence to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), we are committed to integrating material ESG criteria in our investment processes and ownership practices with a view to enhance returns and/or mitigate risks. 
We also aim to embed ESG in our risk management and reporting tools in order to maintain high standards of transparency and accountability.
