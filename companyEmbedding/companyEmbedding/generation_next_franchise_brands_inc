Previously, I covered this business when it was called Fresh Healthy Vending. I cautioned that the company had sketchy management, cash issues, and a product that was something of a commodity, while noting positives including a trend toward healthier eating and recently secured legitimizing relationships with organizations like the American Diabetes Association. The positive factors ended up not being enough and the share price sank as revenues never rose to anywhere near a level that would allow the company to turn a profit. 

 Then, just in time, management found a new product to promote. Generation NEXT now sells robotic frozen yogurt (called FroYo in most company literature) kiosks under the Reis&Irvy brand name, and franchisees are lining up. Anyone lucky enough to purchase shares near their fifty-two week lows has seen returns rocket toward 1000%. 

 The pitch to franchisees is essentially that the startup costs are low, and the maintenance level is even lower. Kiosks cost $40,000 each, with a minimum fleet size of four. For their $160,000 investment, owners become part of an ecosystem that "generates a higher yield per square foot than any other frozen yogurt retail model and operates 24/7." The majority of the work for the franchisee is in restocking, which may take a few short visits a week. The company has a strategic partner in Honey Hills Farms that supplies ingredients and streamlines the process.
 Initially, the vast majority of Generation NEXT's revenue from this venture will come from the sale of machines, and critically as will be discussed later, recognition of these can only occur after the company has found a location for the franchisee. The exact margin on kiosks is not known, but a very good estimate can be gained from the most recent quarter. After backing out the relatively cost free revenues of franchise fees and 'other,' which represents royalties, the remaining revenue represents kiosk sales and sales from company owned Fresh Healthy Vending machines. Since the former makes up the overwhelming majority of the sum of the two, it's safe to say that comparing that figure to cost of revenue will yield a reliable range within which the gross margin for kiosk sales must fall. In this case, that range is between forty and forty five percent. The dream is that eventually an installed base of FroYo slinging robots, yielding 12% royalties, will shift Generation NEXT's revenue mix and push margins upward. However, that never really happened with the Fresh Healthy Vending product so it is too soon to assume it will come to fruition here. A January letter to shareholders from management was the first indication that the frozen yogurt concept was gaining traction. It disclosed:    Booked our first Reis & Irvy's Froyo robot in April 2016.  Booked our 100th Froyo Robot in July 2016. Booked our 250th Froyo Robot in September 2016. Booked our 500th Froyo Robot in December 2016.   and stated that for the year, goals included:    Booking our 1,500th Froyo Robot and 500th franchisee.  Launching our corporate-owned operating model and partnering with a national retail chain. Turning cash flow positive. Generating positive reportable net income. Seeking up to an additional $10-$20 million in investment capital.   An update immediately following the close of the third quarter (the company year-end is in June) provided another crucial data point for the company stating: Our franchise platform is completely built, we have begun securing premium locations for our franchisees and we are eager to see this technology successfully launched in the coming fiscal quarters with the intention of installing most, if not all of the 650 units sold to date, and recognizing the $23,500,000 of estimated deferred revenue on our books well before fiscal 2018 ends."
 There is a lot there to talk about in those two press releases. First, it cannot be overstated how important share price is, given the amount of capital it is looking to raise. At today's prices, raising close to $15 million dilutes shareholders by 39%, but had that raise been overtaken a few months earlier the situation would have been much worse. Potential Dilution:   Base Shares: 29304401 02/14/17   Share Price Shares for $15M Dilution Rate   $0.10 150000000 83.66%   $0.20 75000000 71.90%   $0.30 50000000 63.05%   $0.40 37500000 56.13%   $0.50 30000000 50.59%   $0.60 25000000 46.04%   $0.70 21428571 42.24%   $0.80 18750000 39.02%   $0.90 16666667 36.25%   $1.00 15000000 33.86%   $1.10 13636364 31.76%   $1.20 12500000 29.90%   Conversely, if a down quarter comes into the mix, suddenly Generation NEXT may be back to proposing something that looks very similar to death spiral financing. The next item to consider is the growth rate of bookings. Are sales progressing linearly, exponentially, or flattening out? Initially, the growth looked linear, and when compared to the company's stated goal of booking fifteen hundred units by year-end (I'm assuming management meant calendar year-end as the statement was made in its calendar year in review letter to shareholders) it appears that it hopes this trend continues. However, Generation NEXT's third quarter cast doubt on the issue as the company fell off of its early pace. 

 At this point, it is important to note that Generation NEXT's letter to shareholders included goals for the following year, not guidance. The numbers provided by the company are essentially the best possible outcome and, therefore, necessarily should be viewed with skepticism.
 This distinction underscores the uncertainty of the operation and is especially important in light of the goal of having positive net income for the year. Growth prospects aside, Generation NEXT is certainly racking up bookings for its frozen yogurt machines; however, there is a long- possibly indefinite -delay between when bookings occur and when revenue can actually be recognized. And if revenue isn't recognized in a timely manner, there is no hope for a profitable annual report. Recognition occurs once Generation NEXT secures a location for a franchisee and delivers the robot. A release on February 22nd updated shareholders by reporting, " Reis & Irvy's has secured over 60 premier locations to date with nearly 100 outstanding agreements going through the various channels for approval." About a month later, the company's Q3 update stated, "we have begun securing premium locations for our franchisees and we are eager to see this technology successfully launched in the coming fiscal quarters with the intention of installing most, if not all of the 650 units sold to date, and recognizing the $23,500,000 of estimated deferred revenue on our books well before fiscal 2018 ends." Much of the case for or against Generation NEXT comes down to the likelihood of that last claim. Can it execute on franchise placements? If bookings have leveled off, but time to revenue recognition is short, the company is in great shape. Conversely, it could have two thousand robots booked by year-end and be in terrible shape if only a few hundred have made it to the top line of the income statement. So what does evidence suggest so far? On the one hand, it has had a year post-launch and has only come up with sixty locations, plus one hundred more that are in progress. In the subsequent year, it needs to secure five hundred to meet its goal. Additionally, it is likely that the highly desirable low hanging fruit will be disposed of during the first wave of placements, making each successive one more difficult for Generation NEXT and potentially less profitable for franchisees.
 On the other hand, it's probable that building the franchise base rather than recognizing revenue was its initial focus. Plus, deals with management that own many pieces of commercial property could rapidly boost placement figures. The FroYo robot endeavor is still relatively young, but one item from the business segment that can be examined is the corporate partnership portion of its kiosk business called 19 Degrees. Despite the company website still touting the segment as launching in September of 2016, this was not the case, and the corporate press now states 2017. That's one concrete example of a missed deadline from the company. Looking backwards at the Fresh Healthy Vending franchise gives additional hints on why caution may be warranted. For June 2016 year-end, the company 10k disclosed that $1,592,591 of deferred revenue from franchise bookings had been on the books in excess of one year. Total deferred revenue at the time was over $8 million, but $3.2 million was related to the newly launched FroYo concept. This means that almost a third of deferred revenue from Fresh Healthy franchising was unrecognized and potentially never would be. 

 These franchises are not the same, of course. Healthy vending has many more potential placement locations. I imagine, for example, most elementary schools being open to hosting a healthy snack unit while more hesitant about a frozen yogurt dispensary. However, the healthy vending was also more of a commodity product. Anyone can buy healthy food and put it in a box. The robotic arm and display, although hardly a major feat of modern technology, is a differentiator. As a result, FroYo kiosks may have a higher conversion rate despite their smaller base.
 Third party research appears optimistic that the FroYo and Fresh Healthy Vending concepts are distinct. SeeThruEquity has a $1.50 price target on the stock, and is encouraged to the point that it is talking about the potential of the 12% royalty that Generation NEXT will be receiving from placed machines. Mentioning royalties is putting the cart before the horse, though, as is any discussion of the company launching additional concepts based on intellectual property it recently acquired. There are no significant royalties if units aren't placed, and there's probably no money for additional concepts either. In other words, SeeThruEquity seems to be imagining a best-case scenario and is applying a reckless valuation. If VEND still traded at a dime or even a quarter that would be low given recent developments, but the company no longer trades there. Generation NEXT's market capitalization is now around $25 million, hardly chump change for a company that has failed in a similar arena before and in a best-case scenario may squeak out a small profit this year. If you see the product in person and have to own a piece of the company, I'd wait to see the terms given to the potential capital partner since it'll reflect what someone with the ear of management is willing to pay. Until then, this one is all sizzle and no steak all sprinkles and no froyo.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make other written and oral communications from time to time that contain such statements. Forward-looking statements include statements as to industry trends, our future expectations and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts and are based on certain assumptions of our management (such assumptions may be identified by "we," "our" or "us"). These statements are often identified by the use of words such as "may," "strive," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "estimate," or "continue," and similar expressions or variations. Further, these statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the risks described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" under Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  We caution the reader to carefully consider such factors. Moreover, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  Overview and Description of Business  Discussions with respect to our Company's operations included herein refer to our operating subsidiaries, Fresh Healthy Vending LLC ("FHV LLC"), The Fresh and Healthy Vending Corporation ("FHV Corp"), and our newly formed subsidiaries, Reis & Irvy's, Inc. ("R&I"), 19 Degrees, Inc. and Generation NEXT Vending Robots, Inc. Effective as of July 19, 2013 our Company acquired all assets of FHV Holdings Corp ("FHV Cal") which included FHV LLC in a transaction (the "Acquisition") accounted for as an asset acquisition. With the sale of the Green 4 Media, Inc. business under the Indemnity Agreement effective July 22, 2013, our continuing operations are exclusively those of FHV LLC, FHV Corp., R&I, 19 Degrees, Inc. and Generation NEXT Vending Robots, Inc. Information with respect to our Company's operations prior to the Acquisition is not included herein but may be obtained from viewing our Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2014 filed on Form 10-K on September 29, 2014.  We are a public company listed under the symbol "VEND".  Business  We are a Franchise Development Company and operator of Company-owned vending machines and micro markets that makes healthy eating more convenient through access to high quality healthy foods at high foot traffic destinations. We and our franchisees have over 3,000 vending machines and micro markets primarily offering natural, organic and healthy food and beverage products throughout North America, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Our obligations to each franchisee include securing locations for the healthy vending machines they purchase. We offer thousands of healthy food and beverage products through a national distributor and we train each franchisee at our San Diego headquarters. We provide dedicated account management and ongoing customer service to our franchisees.  During 2016, we obtained the exclusive rights in the USA (excluding Puerto Rico) and Canada for a new frozen yogurt robot, branded Reis & Irvy's. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not yet delivered any frozen yogurt robots.  On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Robofusion, Inc. ("RFI"), whereby the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of RFI, a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology, primarily frozen yogurt vending kiosks/cubes, using RFI's trademarked name of Reis & Irvy's (the "Acquisition"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will provide RFI a cash payment of $420,000, payable in two equal installments, the first of which was paid at the Closing, and shall be reduced by the closing payments made by the Company to the third parties in the amounts as set forth in the Agreement and the second on the one (1) month anniversary of the Closing Date. The Company also issued to RFI a three-year, $2 million note and a five-year common stock purchase warrant for 1,520,000 shares with a strike price of $0.50 per share. Furthermore, certain RFI Officers, Directors and Shareholders will be subject to a five-year, non-compete agreement. Also, the Agreement provides for indemnification and set off of up to $1 million, under certain circumstances.  As a result of our focus on Reis & Irvy's, we will no longer market our vending machines and micro markets to new franchisees. We will however, continue to service and support our current FHV LLC franchisees.  Frozen Yogurt Robots  We are in the process of manufacturing a state-of-the-art frozen yogurt vending machine robot that is a completely unique vending machine and entertainment experience. The robot contains both a cash and cashless vending platform that allows us to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees' and our corporate-owned machines. Our vending standards are UL ("Underwriters Laboratories") and NSF ("National Sanitation Foundation") recognized, which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. Our third-party cashless technology provides the highest level of data and network compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, we generally handle little if any cash in the process. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate compliance with local and national laws and regulations.  The Industry and the Overall Market  We are both a franchisor and operator of vending machine and micro market and frozen yogurt robots. In the franchise market, 2012 saw the first positive growth in the number of franchise establishments since 2008 according to the IFA's annual Franchise Business Economic Outlook report (compiled by HIS Global Insight). Upscale vending is taking over as consumers' palates become more refined and they gravitate toward a health-conscious lifestyle, according to Food Business News. Additionally the vending machine market is expected to expand 1.5 percent by 2015 according to Food Business New. The National Automated Merchandising Association ("NAMA") estimates the vending market is a $30 billion-a-year industry. NAMA also estimates that 100 million Americans will use one of seven million vending machines each day.  Table of Contents  According to the report "A Roadmap for Simultaneously Developing the Supply and Demand for Energy Efficient Beverage Vending Machines," there are approximately 2.5 million food and beverage vending machines in the United States.  Vending Technology  We have developed a cash and cashless vending platform to readily monitor the sales of our franchisees' and our machines. We help our franchisees to grow their business with onsite and virtual management tools, including as an example, wireless remote monitoring telemetry software. Our vending standards are UL ("Underwriters Laboratories") recognized, which we believe are among the highest standards in the industry. This ensures food temperature compliance, which includes auto-contingency processes should electrical or hardware malfunction; it also ensures that ambient air stays within specified parameters at all times. We believe our third-party cashless technology provides one of the highest levels of data and network compliance while ensuring complete transparency. As a result, we generally handle little if any cash in the process. All transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations.  Micro Market Technology  We have developed a high-tech cashless self-checkout kiosk that boasts state-of-the-art point of sale technology currently utilizing an iOS operating system and iPad hardware. The software includes a convenient mobile-based loyalty application with easy to use features and robust functionality. The system also includes a wireless remote monitoring telemetry software with inventory management. The kiosk is completely cashless and all transactions are managed by third parties to facilitate financial compliance with local and national laws and regulations.  Vending and Micro Market Products  We primarily provide a portfolio of fresh, organic and all-natural snacks and drinks. Most products are available via an agreement with a national distributor. We also create custom menus for each franchisee specific to each location type based on their guidelines, requests and demographics. The Company supports the efforts of the United States Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Smart Snacks in School regulation that indicates that all foods sold a la carte, in the school store and vending machines will need to meet certain nutritional standards. The Company's website platform, www.freshandhealthy.org, caters to the new USDA guidelines and supports locations looking to implement a healthy vending program. We have developed customized menus that meet and exceed school and State nutrition guidelines nationwide, facilitating the placement of machines in schools. Our suppliers generally deliver products to our franchisees on a weekly basis and charge a fee of approximately $35.  Frozen Yogurt Products  The Company intends to set up national distribution partners to carry the consumable products required for the frozen yogurt robots.  Competition  The vending industry is large, highly fragmented and consolidating as the market leaders acquire regional vending companies to fulfill their real-estate expansion plans or acquire privately-held service verticals. We believe we have laid the foundation for a national health vending operation with built-in, long-term service agreements and residual product and inventory sales. We believe our business model offers competitive advantages including the following.  Table of Contents  * We focus on healthier food included in school and other health-conscious vending locations. Federal guidelines have been established that aim to counter youth obesity while improving student nutrition, such rules work to discourage our competitors' fare to be marketed to schools.  * We outsource non-core functions to third-party vendors. Outsourced services include: machine manufacturing, transport, location set-up, maintenance, inventory, food management and ordering, payment processing, and cash management. This has historically allowed us to focus more of our financial resources to investing in new services.  Our Principal Suppliers  The Company currently purchases substantially all of its vending machines as needed from a sole supplier, Automated Merchandising Systems Inc. ("AMS"), or its designated distributor. We believe that our relationship with AMS is excellent, and likely to continue. In our view, the loss of our relationship with AMS, should it occur, may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material. The Company has identified at least four other suppliers with comparable vending equipment. The Company also purchases its micro markets from a single manufacturer and believes the loss of its supplier may result in short term disruptions not likely to be material.  Additionally, primarily on behalf of our franchisees, the Company has negotiated discounts with a product distribution chain, United Natural Foods, Inc. ("UNFI"). We believe that our relationship with UNFI is excellent, and likely to continue. In our view, the loss of our relationship with UNFI, should it occur, may result in short-term disruptions not likely to be material. The Company has identified several other suppliers that stock the same or comparable products. Furthermore, our franchisees are able to purchase directly from UNFI, however, without our negotiated discount.  Governmental Regulation  We are required to comply with regulations governing the sale of franchises - the primary component of our business. Thirteen states directly regulate franchising and require pre-sale registration of a Franchise Disclosure Document ("FDD"), or offering prospectus, by the franchisor, normally with the state agency that oversees the sale of securities in that state, and pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate by a franchisor before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. Franchise sales in the remaining 37 states are generally subject to the Franchise Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), which requires the pre-sale delivery of an FDD to a franchise candidate before the signing of a binding agreement or the payment of any money to the franchisor. A franchisor that fails to properly register and maintain the registration of its FDD and disclose its franchisee candidates in the 13 registration states, unless exempt from registration under a few narrowly drawn exceptions to the registration requirements, is subject to legal action by its franchisees for damages and, under certain circumstances, for rescission of the franchise agreements, and to administrative, civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed as well. The FTC's Franchise Rule does not require registration of an FDD with the FTC; however, a franchisor that fails to properly disclose its franchisee candidates is subject to claims for breach of contract, fraud, damages, sanctions and the like.  Table of Contents  Our Employees  We had approximately 40 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.  Seasonality  We do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality other than that resulting from vending machine sales within schools.  Three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to three months December 31, 2015  Revenues  We had revenues of $1,222,951 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to revenues of $1,615,657 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. This represented a decrease of $392,706 or 24.3%. Our revenues decreased largely due to a decrease in the number of machines that were installed as well as a reduction in Company owned machine revenue. Overall orders received and installations (at which point our Company recognizes revenues) of machines were 0 and 105, respectively, during the three months ended December 31 2016, compared to 77 and 156, respectively, for the corresponding three months ended December 31, 2015. As of May 2016, the Company has discontinued sales of FHV franchises and has instead focused its sales and marketing efforts on Reis & Irvy's, its new frozen yogurt franchise.  Cost of revenues  Cost of revenues was $584,323 during the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $846,565 during the three months ended December 31, 2015. This represents a decrease of $262,242 or 31%. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in machines installed for the quarter.  Gross margin  Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $638,628 compared to $769,092 for the corresponding period ending December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $130,464 or 17%. Gross margin percentage during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 52.2% compared to 47.6% for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margin percentage of 4.6% is primarily a result of increased margin on vending machine sales as well as the elimination of the Company's corporate route, which produced lower margins.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 of $3,150,549 represent an increase of $1,697,387 from the $1,453,162 in the three months ended December 31, 2015. The major components of selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows:  Table of Contents  Personnel expenses of $969,482 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 represent an increase of $281,177 or 40.85% from the $688,305 in the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel as well as an increase in commissions related to Reis & Irvy's.  Marketing and advertising expenses increased $188,563 to $432,704 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $244,141 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 77.24%, was primarily attributable to an increase in national radio advertising and Internet marketing for the new Reis & Irvy's franchise.  Professional fees increased $438,729 or 254.8% to $610,901 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 from $172,172 during the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional legal fees with respect to corporate matters, the Robofusion acquisition as well as litigation.  Additionally, the Company incurred expenses of $395,000 related to the Robofusion license fees and $295,000 related to research and development for the new frozen yogurt robot.  Provision for income taxes  During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a net loss and operated as a C-corp for federal and state income tax purposes. A valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the tax benefit arising from our net operating loss due to the substantial uncertainty about whether such benefit will ever be realized.  Net loss  Net loss was $3,023,511 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $899,677 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss resulted from decreased sales and gross margin as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses and derivative liability expense.  Basic net loss per share during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.11 and $0.03, respectively.  Six months ended December 31, 2016 compared to six months December 31, 2015  Revenues  We had revenues of $3,045,998 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, compared to revenues of $3,177,105 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. This represented a decrease of $131,107 or 4.1%. Our revenues decreased largely due to a reduction in Company owned machine revenue offset by an increase in royalty income. Overall orders received and installations (at which point our Company recognizes revenues) of machines were 0 and 274, respectively, during the six months ended December 31 2016, compared to 214 and 294, respectively, for the corresponding six months ended December 31, 2015. As of May 2016, the Company has discontinued sales of FHV franchises and has instead focused its sales and marketing efforts on Reis & Irvy's, its new frozen yogurt franchise.  Cost of revenues  Cost of revenues was $1,457,362 during the six months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,647,418 during the six months ended December 31, 2015. This represents a decrease of $190,056 or 11.5%. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in Company owned machine revenue offset by the increase in royalty revenue.  Gross margin  Gross margin for the six months ended December 31, 2016 was $1,588,636 compared to $1,529,687 for the corresponding period ending December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $58,949 or 3.9%. Gross margin percentage during the six months ended December 31, 2016 was 52.2% compared to 48.1% for the corresponding period ended December 31, 2015. The increase in gross margin percentage of 4.1% is primarily a result of the elimination of the Company's corporate route, which produced lower margins, as well as an increase in royalty revenue.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2016 of $6,274,127 represent an increase of $3,353,350 from the $2,920,777 in the six months ended December 31, 2015. The major components of selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows:  Table of Contents  Personnel expenses of $2,023,109 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 represent an increase of $610,533 or 43.2% from the $1,412,576 in the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel as well as an increase in commissions related to Reis & Irvy's.  Marketing and advertising expenses increased $474,481 to $924,577 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $450,096 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase of 105.4%, was primarily attributable to an increase in national radio advertising and Internet marketing for the new Reis & Irvy's franchise.  Professional fees increased $541,195 or 191.1% to $824,474 during the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $283,279 during the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to additional legal fees with respect to corporate matters, the Robofusion acquisition as well as litigation.  Provision for franchisee rescissions and refunds increased $823,638 from $58,868 to $882,506. The increase was related to franchisee refunds and a legal matter.  Additionally, the Company incurred expenses of $395,000 related to the Robofusion license fees and $313,299 related to research and development for the new frozen yogurt robot and $78,284 related to franchisee relations.  Provision for income taxes  During the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred a net loss and operated as a C-corp for federal and state income tax purposes. A valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the tax benefit arising from our net operating loss due to the substantial uncertainty about whether such benefit will ever be realized.  Net loss  Net loss was $5,130,404 during the six months ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $1,769,195 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss resulted from increased selling, general and administrative expenses and derivative liability expense, offset by a decrease in accretion of discount.  Basic net loss per share during the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0.18 and $0.07, respectively.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the three months ended December 31, 2016 we had a net loss totaling $3,023,511 with positive cash flows from operations totaling $798,962. Our cash balance at December 31, 2016 was $368,010. Since the date of the closing of the FHV Acquisition, our sales were less than anticipated and the resulting cash flows from franchise sales was not sufficient to cover expenditures associated with our daily operations resulting in a substantial decrease in our cash balances. Also, we used cash on hand to retire liabilities associated with the franchise rescissions. As of the filing date of the Form 10-Q, our Company has consumed the vast majority of its available cash, including the cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock received in July of 2013 and the issuance of several debt instruments. In order to ensure sufficient liquidity for our continuing operations, we will require additional capital financing in the form of either debt or equity (or a combination thereof) financing. Management believes that it will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful.  Our current plans include research and development expenditures for the production of the next generation robot, payments required for the purchase of the Robofusion intellectual property (previous owner of the frozen yogurt robot intellectual property) capital expenditures for the purchase of corporate-owned and operated frozen yogurt robots as well as the repurchase of machines from franchisees opting to rescind their franchise agreements. Given our current cash position, we may be forced to curtail our plans by delaying or suspending the production and purchase of frozen yogurt robots.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $501,000 outstanding under the Initial Notes, $250,000 outstanding under the Financing Agreement, $600,000 outstanding under the Promissory Note, $353,000 outstanding under a loan agreement with its Chairman, approximately $297,000 under two Secured Promissory Notes and $2 million under a loan related to the Robofusion acquisition.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We had no material off balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2016.  Critical Accounting Policies  We have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and that require management's most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Revenue recognition - Our primary revenue generating transactions come from the sale of franchises and vending machines and micro markets to the franchisees. There are no franchise fees charged beyond the initial first year franchise fees. We receive ongoing royalty fees and annual advertising fees as a percentage of either franchisees' gross revenues or gross margins on vending machine sales.  Table of Contents  We recognize revenues and associated costs in connection with franchisees (machines and franchise fees) at the time that we have substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the franchise agreement. We consider substantial performance to have occurred when: 1) no remaining obligations are unfulfilled under the franchise agreement; 2) there is no intent to refund any cash received or to forgive any unpaid amounts due from franchisees; 3) all of the initial services spelled out in the franchise agreement have been performed; and 4) we have met all other material conditions or obligations. Revenues and expenses from product sales to franchisees are roughly equivalent and are accounted for on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as agency sales, net. During fiscal 2015, the Company changed the process by which franchisees order products. Currently, all franchisees order directly from our national distributor and the Company receives a commission of 5% on those purchases. We recognize the commission when earned. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales of company-owned machines when products are purchased; we receive electronic sales records on our company- owned units. We recognize royalty fees as revenue when earned. Advertising fees are recorded as a liability until marketing expenditures are incurred.  The Company records the amount of a franchise sale, machines and franchise fees, as deferred revenue until the conditions above have been met. Once the machines are installed, the Company records the corresponding machine and franchise fee as revenue, on a pro rata basis based on the number of machines installed relative to the total machines purchased.  The Company records the value of company-owned machines as inventory when purchased. Once the machines are installed, the machine value is transferred to fixed assets and depreciated over its useful life.  It is not our policy to allow for returns, discounts or warranties to our franchisees. Under certain circumstances, including as the result of regulatory action, our Company may become obligated to offer our franchisees amounts in . . .

	6.1



	Orders

	. CLIENT will place a Purchase Order (PO) for completed products with D&K, along with a requested Product delivery schedule. CLIENT and D&K will work together to ensure that this PO is placed sufficiently in advance of the requested Product delivery schedule to enable D&K to order the necessary material to comply with the PO and Product Delivery Schedule. This PO and Product delivery schedule will be binding and document CLIENT’s financial obligation to D&K to cover the material that D&K places on order with suppliers and all Manufacturing Charges (scrap, freight, labor, manufacturing overhead, S,G&A and profit). D&K shall make CLIENT aware of this financial burden per

	Section 7.3

	below. Each PO will include: (i) unit quantity; (ii) unit price; (iii) shipping destination; (iv) Ship Date; and (v) other instructions or requirements pertinent to the PO. All Orders received prior to the Lead Time shall be filled by D&K according to the terms of the PO. To the extent of any inconsistency between the terms of a PO and the terms of this Agreement, the terms specified in this Agreement shall control and take precedence. CLIENT may increase the quantity of Product in a batch order or accelerate order date of such batches set forth in

	Exhibit C

	so long as CLIENT pays for such orders in advance and order is placed according to material lead times. CLIENT may designate certain units to be shipped to destinations outside of the United States. In such case, D&K shall manufacture the designated units to meet the equivalent foreign requirements provided CLIENT has had said units certified to be compliant with regulatory requirements in the destination countries.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	6.2



	Order Acknowledgment

	. A PO shall be deemed to have been placed as of the date of confirmation of receipt of the PO by D&K. D&K will confirm the receipt of a PO electronically or through facsimile to CLIENT within five (5) working days for all orders placed. D&K shall have five (5) additional working days in which to accept or reject the Order for orders of similar volumes and delivery schedules. D&K shall accept all PO’s that conform to the terms of this Agreement and provide sufficient Lead Time (including Order increases).





	 




	 




	 






	 



	6.3



	Order cancelations or order reductions

	. CLIENT will place POs for a volume of Product. In the event CLIENT requests in writing a change or cancelation of a PO, D&K shall endeavor to cancel, or delay for future Orders, as much of the affected excess material as possible. For all material that cannot be cancelled or rescheduled, D&K will invoice CLIENT for full payment of the excess material (including applicable restocking charges) called out in the original PO and ship the material to a CLIENT designated location. Excess material will be invoiced at actual inventory acquisition cost, including component cost, inbound freight, outbound freight plus a material burden of 15%. D&K agrees to repurchase this excess material from CLIENT should production of CLIENT Products resume. NOTE: If actual Product demand from CLIENT necessitates frequent changes, cancellations or ‘push-outs’ of POs, any product delivery cost increases which are actually incurred by D&K as a direct result thereof will be reflected in the Product cost to CLIENT and/or additional NREs. In addition, documented line stoppages, pauses, shutdowns, or any other delays to the build schedule caused directly or indirectly by cancelations or reductions may be subject to additional NRE charges. All additional NRE charges will be submitted in writing for approval by CLIENT in advance.

	CLIENT Product and Part Prices

	. D&K’s prices for CLIENT Products and Service Parts are listed in

	Exhibit C

	, in U.S. currency unless otherwise stated D&K agrees, upon request, to utilize the format outlined in

	Exhibit C

	to respond to CLIENT Product requests for quotation. Final transfer pricing for the first batch of 100 units will be determined after the Pilot Run materials are purchased and the Pilot Run of 3 units have been completed.

	7.2



	Economic Order Quantities.

	D&K shall strive to order a volume of components that effectively balances inventory exposure with volume discount pricing and set-up and shipping costs. D&K and CLIENT shall work together to make these decisions based on the current overall economic and production situation at the time. If the volume of components required to reach mutually agreed to economic order quantities exceeds the quantity covered under the PO, CLIENT will place an additional purchase order with D&K to cover the additional components.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	7.3



	Material Exposure & Inventory Report.

	D&K shall be proactive in reporting, on a monthly basis, the status of CLIENT’s financial exposure of all material in the pipeline and on hand in inventory (“Material Exposure and Inventory Report”). A breakdown shall be provided showing material to meet open POs to meet EOQ/MOQ (as defined below). The Material Exposure and Inventory Report will also include a list of all slow moving inventory that has had zero demand over the last 60-day period and has zero forecasted requirements for the next 60 days. CLIENT’s financially responsibility for inventory designated as slow moving will be to purchase said inventory at actual inventory acquisition cost (direct material cost including inbound freight) plus material burden of 15%. D&K agrees to warehouse CLIENT owned inventory and agrees to repurchase CLIENT owned inventory per said CLIENT owned inventory agreement should demand for CLIENT owned inventory resume. CLIENT will be financially responsible for all material in the pipeline that has been ordered to accommodate the Orders and that is reported in the monthly Material Exposure & Inventory Report. All material ordered outside BOM documented lead time, minimum order quantities (“MOQ”), or to achieve economic order quantities (“EOQ”) for parts must be approved by CLIENT. CLIENT agrees to work with D&K to mitigate D&K’s unreasonable risk of financial exposure due to all material in the pipeline, or on-hand, as outlined in the Material Exposure and Inventory report on a quarterly basis via PO or wire transfer. Materials will be invoiced at actual inventory acquisition cost, including component cost, inbound freight, outbound freight plus a material burden of 15%. D&K agrees to repurchase this excess material from CLIENT should production of CLIENT Products resume. Such repurchase shall be at the same cost paid by CLIENT.

Cost reduction proceeds from initial baseline manufacturing cost (defined in Exhibit C) will be split at a ratio of 50% to CLIENT and 50% to D&K as it is expected that D&K shall make investments to reduce cost by sourcing high-cost components through alternative suppliers and fabrication processes, and improving manufacturing and test processes. D&K agrees to pay for the up-front investments to make these cost improvements. When the cost reduction is realized, D&K will be entitled to full repayment of its investment in this cost reduction before the cost savings is shared with CLIENT. If CLIENT makes the initial investment to reduce costs, CLIENT will be entitled to full repayment of its investment in this cost reduction before the cost savings is shared with D&K. All cost reduction proceeds sharing will be calculated based on the Direct Manufacturing Cost after any agreed-to mark-up as defined in Exhibit C.

	17.2



	Limitations

	. D&K’s obligation to indemnify the CLIENT pursuant to Section 17.1 shall not apply to the extent that any such Losses arise from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of any Indemnitee. For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that D&K will perform work per Requirements and Specifications provided by CLIENT. Therefore, provided that D&K has complied with the CLIENT Requirements and Specifications in the production of the Deliverables, then, D&K shall not be liable for nor ensure the design of the Product(s); nor shall D&K be liable for the design safety or design regulatory compliance of the Product(s), including but not limited to ensuring that the Products meet applicable government or responsible agency regulations, nor shall D&K be liable to ensure that the design of the Products does not infringe on any third party intellectual property rights, as this is CLIENT’s responsibility under this Agreement. Should the Products fail to meet applicable government approvals, standards or regulations as a result of designs (versus D&K manufacturing processes), D&K may cease production until CLIENT and D&K agree to required changes and applicable qualifications are met, without being in breach of this Agreement. Based on notice from D&K or an applicable agency regarding regulatory requirements related to the Product design, CLIENT is responsible for obtaining required approvals relative to any changes required to be made to the Product design and will be responsible for all costs attributable to developing new designs to meet such requirements and all reasonable costs associated with the cessation of production until applicable qualifications are met.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	17.3



	Duty to Notify

	. CLIENT will give D&K prompt notice of any Third Party Claim, and will give D&K the authority, information, and assistance (at D&K’s expense) to handle the defense. If D&K does not diligently pursue resolution of the claim nor provide CLIENT with reasonable assurances that it will diligently pursue resolution, then CLIENT may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, take responsibility for the defense and D&K shall reimburse and indemnify CLIENT for all costs incurred by CLIENT in pursuing such defense (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs). D&K shall not settle any Third Party Claim on a basis that would require a change in the design or manufacture of any Product, or any change in CLIENT’s manner of operation without CLIENT’s prior written consent.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	17.4



	Additional Limitation

	. D&K will be relieved of its obligations under this

	Section 17

	to the extent that the claim of infringement or unauthorized use arises out of compliance with CLIENT’s Requirements or Specifications. Provided D&K meets its obligations hereunder, this section 17 states D&K’s entire liability to CLIENT for Third Party Claims against CLIENT.

	18.2



	Limitations

	. CLIENT’s obligation to indemnify the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 18.1 shall not apply to any such Losses that arise from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of any Indemnitee, or to the extent that D&K is obligated to indemnify CLIENT under Section 17. Provided CLIENT meets its obligations hereunder, this section 18 states CLIENT’s entire liability to D&K for Third Party Claims against D&K.

	Escalated Dispute Resolution








	 







	 



	25.1


	The parties’ Agreement Coordinators agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve disputes regarding all material obligations specified in this Agreement. If such negotiations and meetings do not resolve the dispute within ten (10) days of written communication of the dispute, then each party will nominate one senior officer of the rank of vice president or higher for each D&K and CLIENT, as its representative as defined in Exhibit E. These representatives will meet within ten (10) days of their nomination to attempt to resolve such dispute. If the representatives are not able to reach mutual resolution of disputes within thirty (30) days from the date of the original communication, the parties agree to engage a third-party mediator to attempt to resolve the dispute. Such mediation shall occur within ninety (90) days from the date of the original communication. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, the Parties will enter into binding arbitration as per Section 29.11 of this Agreement, provided however that either party may seek injunctive relief during the arbitration process.

Such insurance will apply as primary insurance and no other insurance will be called upon to contribute to a loss covered thereunder. In addition, such policies will permit D&K to waive, on its own behalf and on behalf of its insurers, any rights of subrogation against CLIENT. Such insurance policies will be written with appropriately licensed and financially responsible insurers (Best’s rated B+ or better), and will endeavor to provide for a minimum of thirty (30) days written notice to CLIENT of any cancellation or reduction in coverage. Certificates of insurance evidencing the required coverage and limits will be furnished at CLIENT’s request. Additionally, D&K shall maintain workers compensation insurance for all its employees that are required to have Worker’s Compensation insurance, and who work in or enter an CLIENT facility, and D&K agrees to indemnify CLIENT under the provisions of Section 17 against any and all claims brought by any D&K employees, agents or assigns who are not so covered.

	Consent to Arbitration

	. Subject to the terms of Section 25 above, including but not limited to a parties’ right to immediately pursue injunctive or other equitable relief, and to ensure rapid and economical resolution of any disputes which may arise under this Agreement, CLIENT and D&K agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature whatsoever, arising or resulting from or regarding the interpretation, performance, enforcement or breach of this Agreement shall be resolved by confidential, final and binding arbitration (rather than trial by jury or court or resolution in some other forum) to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in California under the then existing AAA commercial arbitration rules (the “Rules) before one (1) arbitrator selected in accordance with the Rules each of whom shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter hereof. Any decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Parties, and a judgment thereon may be entered in, and enforced by, any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which an award is entered. If for any reason, all or part of this arbitration provision is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other portion of this arbitration provision or any other jurisdiction, but this provision will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable part or parts of this provision had never been contained herein, consistent with the general intent of the parties insofar as possible. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator in any such proceeding, including the fees and expenses of any person retained by the arbitrator as well as all other expenses of such proceeding (including the fees and expenses of a single firm of counsel for CLIENT and of a single firm of counsel for D&K), shall be borne by the respective parties as follows: (i) the party that did not initiate such proceeding shall bear the portion of such fees and expenses represented by the fraction having a numerator equal to the net dollar amount of any recovery actually awarded to the initiating party by the arbitrator in such proceeding and having a denominator equal to the maximum aggregate dollar amount originally sought to be recovered by the initiating party in connection with the claim being arbitrated; and (ii) the initiating party shall bear the remaining portion of such fees and expenses. In the event that multiple claims shall be involved in any such proceeding, the fees and expenses of such proceedings shall be allocated as provided above based on the outcome of the claim having the largest dollar amount originally sought to be recovered.

	EXHIBIT B – STATEMENTS OF WORK/D&K DELIVERABLES



	 


	The following is the Statement of Work (SOW) for the Generation Next manufacturing program which summarizes the activities to be performed and deliverables with supporting assumptions. For additional details please reference D&K proposal #20170504TMD R1.0.


	 



	Assumptions:



	 







	 



	1.


	Generation Next (GN) has developed a frozen yogurt dispensing kiosk and is seeking a contract manufacturing partner for the production of the unit. GN has a partner who is assembling the first prototype of the new generation design of the kiosk. As of the date of this proposal, D&K has no knowledge that any verification testing of the new design has been conducted. The cost estimations in this proposal are based on partial information available from GN which has not been independently verified by D&K at the time the proposal was developed. This proposal includes D&K's estimated one time New Product Introduction (NPI) costs, transfer price model and projected prepayments from GN to support the production ramp. The parties agree that the NPI costs provided in this proposal are an estimate and the actual costs incurred will be the responsibility of GN. The parties further agree that the transfer price for the 1st 100 units will be adjusted after the pilot run build and that transfer prices for subsequent builds will be set based on current costing information from the prior build.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	2.


	The transfer price estimate for the first 100 unit build in this proposal is based on the following information, derived from information provided by Generation Next, but not validated by D&K as of the time of this proposal. Final transfer pricing for the first batch of 100 units will be determined after the materials are purchased and the Pilot Run of 3 units have been completed. Quantity 100 BOM cost is $____. Assembly and test time including wrap and packaging is ___ hours.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	3.


	This proposal assumes the design of the kiosk will be verified and demonstrated to be ready for release to production as required per the schedule included in the proposal. This proposal includes no resources for product design activities including trouble shooting, root cause analysis, redesign or verification. Should the design prove to be not ready for production, or for other unforeseen causes, it may be necessary for GN to provide additional PO coverage and prepayments to cover the unanticipated additional NPI work.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	4.


	Pilot Run units will be delivered to GN upon satisfaction of acceptance criteria mutually agreed to during the NPI phase. Pilot Run units are provided on an as is basis and are not subject to any workmanship warranty.

	- 39 -







	 




	 




	 







	 



	5.


	GN will make cash prepayments via wire transfer to D&K to fund the NPI activities and transfer price for production units as described in this proposal. Prepayments will be adjusted as necessary to account for actual costs incurred including those resulting from design instability, schedule delays, inaccurate material cost estimates, MOQ, inaccurate labor cost estimates, etc.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	6.


	Generation Next will provide D&K with one prototype unit at no cost to D&K.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	7.


	Lancer will provide engineering support for design issues. One Lancer engineer will be available on site at D&K San Diego for 3 days for the pilot build.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	8.


	Plastic part designs are ready for release to tooling at project inception.

	Generation Next is responsible for obtaining all necessary product regulatory approvals.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	11.


	All Software/Firmware is to be provided by Generation Next.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	12.


	The material purchase for the Pilot Run and 1st batch of 100 Units will be done at risk (before design/supply chain verification is complete, ie Tooling) to accelerate the overall schedule. Client accepts all risks associated with this schedule. Such risks include: schedule variability due to potential product stability issues, rework due to required design changes on exposed material, scrap costs and field reliability problems that could occur due to minimal amount of product testing performed.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	13.


	Transfer pricing is Ex Works D&K's San Diego facility.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	14.


	The transfer price provided in this proposal does not contemplate the following:




	 







	 




	 



	-


	Software/media/content license/royalty fees

	Part availability and vendor cycles times/lead times, as shown in the program plan, will not impact schedule. No expedite fees are contemplated in this program.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	22.


	All suppliers are assumed to be D&K qualified suppliers. In the event the project requires a new supplier or client specified supplier, additional qualifications costs may be incurred. D&K's NPI NRE estimate does not contemplate qualifying any GN suppliers.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	23.


	Economic Order Quantities (EOQ) and Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ) - If materials are subject to EOQ/MOQ’s, D&K and Client shall work together to make purchasing decisions that effectively balance inventory exposure with pricing, set-up fees, and inbound freight costs. If EOQ/MOQ’s result in the material costs exceeding the quantity covered under any PO or security deposit, the Client will place an additional purchase order with or wire transfer additional funds to D&K to cover the additional material costs including inbound freight, markup, and applicable taxes. At the conclusion of the build, D&K will invoice Client PO or apply the costs against the deposit for the excess materials.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	24.


	Environmental testing (shock, vibration, temperature, drop, etc ) are not contemplated in this proposal.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	25.


	Client will provide legal/IP support for search/research of prior art and potential violation.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	26.


	If requested D&K will run the agency/regulatory testing and approval cycle on behalf of the CLIENT at CLIENT expense.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	27.


	ECOs requested by Client will be processed in accordance with D&K's Engineering Change Order (ECO) Process – Changes to drawings, designs, Bill of Material (BOM), acceptance criteria, or any other requirements after completion of PLM (ARAS) and ERP system loads will be subject to applicable administrative fees, material costs, and labor charges to implement the ECO's. An Administrative Fee (shown in the table below) will be charged to assess the impact of the ECO (transfer price, NRE, material, schedule). ECO costs and any corresponding adjustments to any pricing or delivery schedules will be communicated to the Client for authorization. Materials that become obsolete due to ECO’s will be invoiced to client at the cost of the material plus inbound freight, applicable taxes, and 15% markup.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy. Arbitration shall be the exclusive final remedy for any dispute between the parties. Any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or in connection with the Contest, or any Prizes awarded, shall be resolved individually without resort to any form of class action. No claim for arbitration under this provision may be made more than one (1) year after the date the Grand Prize Winners of the Contest are announced.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTICIPANT HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND ANY OTHER DAMAGES, OTHER THAN FOR ACTUAL OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES, AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY

The Contest is subject to all applicable U.S. federal, state, and local laws.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Terms shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.

NextGen in Franchising










Value Proposition


What specific value are you bringing to the market and to your customers with your business? This is the promise you are making as a brand. It’s the main reason customers should choose you, over your competitors. Your value proposition is the reason people should be motivated to buy from you.
Explain how your business solves problems, offers solutions or improves situations. What specific benefits does a customer receive?
Biography
Your biography is a description of who you are and what you’ve done in your career, education, and life. This is the background you want to represent the entrepreneur driving your business. It is not a resume, but tells a more literal story about you. Who are you now? Where have you come from? Where are you planning to go in your career?
Executive Summary
When you write a business plan, the Executive Summary is the first page or two at the top that summarizes everything inside. This tells the story of your company – the story an investor most wants to see and understand before considering an investment in you. This is no different. If you win this competition, a significant investment will be made to help you become more successful. You do not have to submit a business plan here for this application. However, this is a comprehensive overview of the business described in a page or two.
Your Executive Summary needs to include:

Your business name, location(s), and services or products you sell.
The problem you are addressing, and your solution.
Summary of your target market, competition, team, financial considerations and milestones.

And should answer the franchise-specific questions below:

Why would/does your company work well in the franchise model?
What skills will/do your franchisees need to be successful?
Where do you see your business in 5 years?
What do you need help with most?

Alejandro Souza

PixzaIdea: Unique PizzaMEXICO									


2017 Grand Prize Winner
Mexico City-based entrepreneur Alejandro Souza launched Pixza just over a year ago, an innovative and unique pizza concept that sells the world’s first blue corn pizza made out of 100 percent Mexican ingredients. What makes the restaurant so special is that it simultaneously operates as a social empowerment platform; for every five slices sold, a sixth slice is automatically delivered to homeless young adults who then have the opportunity to join the company’s “The Route of Change” program. Those who consequently graduate the program receive a job offer from their local pizzeria, as well as an opportunity to live in their own apartment and work with a personal coach in order to establish and implement a life plan. Consequently, the restaurant exclusively employs local homeless young adults in need and gives them an outlet to change their lives.

Intellectual Property AssetsMarketwiredJanuary 3, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - Jan 3, 2017) - Generation NEXT Franchise Brands (  OTCQB :  VEND ) announced today that it has acquired the intellectual property assets of South Carolina-based Robufusion, Inc., a developer of robotic-kiosk vending technology. As a result of this mutually beneficial deal, Generation NEXT will provide Robofusion a cash payment of $420,000, issuance of a three-year, $2-million note and warrant consideration of 1,520,000 five-year warrants with a strike price of $.50 per share. Furthermore, certain Robofusion Officers, Directors and Shareholders will be subject to a five-year, non-compete agreement. Among the other key assets in its holdings, Generation NEXT now owns the following intellectual property: Reis & Irvy's trademark (U.S. Patent & Trademark Office trademark registration number 4530264); U.S. utility patent number 8,989,893; U.S. design patent number D647,926; and U.S. patent application numbers 20140120235 and 20160242434.Earlier last year, Generation NEXT launched its newest franchise concept, Reis & Irvy's, a brand and technology originally licensed exclusively from Robofusion.The ground-breaking technology serves two different flavors of frozen soft-serve desserts as well as a swirl option, all available with six toppings in under 60 seconds and showcases the world's first soft-serve, robotic vending system. With the exclusive ownership of these assets, Generation NEXT is now exploring ways to leverage this technology for the development of future concepts that will expand its business.Upon receiving the technology from Robofusion in February of 2016, Generation NEXT brought together a team of engineering professionals to upgrade and streamline the hardware, the software and overall mechanics of the Reis & Irvy's "Froyo Robot" in an attempt to develop a completely redesigned unit that has been modified on almost every level. A completely customized double-barrel, soft-serve unit located inside the robot will ensure the product is delivered at the perfect temperature and consistency. The user interface and software has been completely redesigned with telemetry software, allowing ease-of-use for our current and future franchisee operators. For example, the robots will electronically distribute multiple daily reports to the franchisees, providing highly beneficial information such as product temperature, consumable levels and daily, weekly and monthly financial sales performance. This is all accomplished by Generation NEXT adding temperature and product level sensors throughout the technology.Since customer satisfaction and safety are a top priority, Generation NEXT put its new design through the rigorous NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) and UL (Underwriters Laboratories) certification process to ensure the robots meet the highest standards in food safety and overall design for manufacturing. In addition, Generation NEXT has completely re-designed the self-cleaning mechanism. After every use, the robot cleans and sanitizes the dispensing spigots to ensure no residue is left from the previous order. This patent-pending, self-cleaning design opportunity is just one of the many examples of Generation NEXT evolving and elevating this technology as it prepares for multiple opportunities both domestically under the Reis and Irvy's brand and abroad via licensing agreements.Finally, with entertainment, novelty and the customer experience being a priority, Generation NEXT added proximity sensors to the robot. This allows the robot to sense when customers are nearby with the completely redesigned robotic arm moving into action by dancing and lighting up, making it very difficult for consumers to avoid the "wow factor" when walking past or approaching the unit.To allow Generation NEXT the opportunity to take advantage of both domestic and international sales opportunities in the form of franchising and licensing, the company has implemented and contracted third-party manufacturing, distribution, installation, training and a service network to support its customers in over 140 countries around the world.For more information on Generation NEXT Franchise Brands or their family of brands, including Reis & Irvy's, Fresh Healthy Vending or 19 Degrees, please visit www.gennextbrands.com or call toll free 888-902-7558.Read MoreThis information is not intended as an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, a franchise.

  Business 2 Community     BrandViews / Demandbase  How to Generate Higher-Quality Leads with Account-Based Marketing    James Allgood  — April 2, 2016  Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Flipboard  0   187 SHARES As marketers, we spend a lot of our time and resources on lead generation. But unfortunately, the leads we generate don’t always translate into revenue. In fact, 50% of marketing generated leads are never followed up on by Sales (Miller Pierce).In the last decade, Sales and Marketing have taken great strides to integrate their processes, but there’s still a disconnect between the two teams. Traditionally, Sales has been measured by revenue and Marketing on lead volume. But what if Sales and Marketing were both responsible for revenue?To get Sales and Marketing on the same page, we’ve teamed up with Integrate to provide B2B marketers with a next-level Account-Based Advertising offering. It’s an automated process to generate high-value leads from decision-makers at specific target accounts showing elevated interest. We have found that by increasing the quality of the leads you deliver to Sales, velocity increases, deal size improves and conversion rates swell.So how does it work?1. Build a list of target accountsYour target account list consists of companies with the most potential to your business. It can include customers, prospects, partners or a mix of all three.There are several ways to approach this process:• Use the list of accounts your sales team has put together• Gather key stakeholders from both Marketing and Sales to align over a set of key accounts

Generate new target account-based leadsFrom there, Integrate will focus on the accounts showing active buying signals and engage key stakeholders from those accounts. You’ll end up with a list of high-quality leads that have already engaged with your company and content, which makes them more likely to convert into customers.Lead generation doesn’t have to be such a struggle. By automating the process and focusing on priority accounts, you can align with your sales team and work together to grow the business and drive revenue.If you’re curious to see how this works in action, watch this on-demand webinar to see how Demandbase and Integrate work together.
