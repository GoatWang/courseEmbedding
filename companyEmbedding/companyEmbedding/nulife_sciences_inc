					Full Description



NuLife Sciences, Inc. (NuLife), formerly Smoofi, Inc., incorporated on October 15, 2013, is a biomedical company focused on advancing human organ transplant technology and medical research. The Company is engaged in the development of an initial design and framework of its proposed online marketplace and community portal platform. It operates through two segments: to raise funds sufficient to fund ongoing animal trials in further development and regulatory approval of the Nulife Process through various affiliated medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs) that conducts its preclinical and clinical studies of the NuLife Process and an online marketplace and community platform. The Company offers a method, NuLife Technique that could eliminate the need for an organ or tissue match and the necessity for anti-rejection drugs. The Company's NuLife Technique is suitable for a range of clinical indications. The Company has completed discovery phase for its technique, and has initiated Preclinical phase involving animal experiments on its pathway to commercialization. The Company’s subsidiaries include NuLife Technologies, Inc. and NuLife BioMed, Inc.The Company’s GeoCalendar technology is based on both geographic location services (GIS) and mobile technology. A service requestor or service provider has the ability to list, search, track and manage services by geographic location, day and time, and service type. The Company’s technology has the basic online community features for the family or individual who needs help, including a dedicated Website for each family or individual to list and track their schedules, medication, transportation requirements and service requests. The Company’s technology has the basic online community features for the service provider, including a detailed online profile (gender, availability, rate and zone improvement plan (ZIP) Code), pictures and videos. The Company’s NuLife payment engine allows service providers to accept credit card transactions, either on the NuLife Website, on their own Website or through e-mail. The Nulife process procedure follows six steps: the organ is removed, or the donor organ is examined. Then the Organ is put through a decellularization processes to isolate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a tissue from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM scaffold of the original tissue. Specific cells are then harvested from bone marrow of the intended recipient. Following the bone marrow harvest the particular hematopoietic cells are used in the process, as well as a procedure involving temperature and pressure factors (under vacuum). As a result of the vacuum process, specific cells are released from platelets without complete platelet degranulation. The negative pressure created by the vacuum pulls the growth factors out of the platelets and into the plasma. Once processed, the cells are reintroduced into the recipient influencing further growth of an already implanted and recellularized organ, which is an exact tissue match of not being rejected without anti-rejection drugs.The commercialization of the NuLife Process requires successful completion of a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials, as well as the demonstration of the reproducibility of the process. The steps include pre-clinical studies, defining the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC), documentation and necessary support about the process, and an escalating series of studies (Phase I, II and III).The Company's business focus is to acquire and/or develop and market software and services that will develop the performance and functionality of the Internet services used by individuals and by small to medium sized businesses. The Company's products and services, an online marketplace and community, use technology that will enable users, both service requestors and service providers, to work collaboratively. Service requestors (people or companies requesting a service) name their own price, date and time for any service. A service requestor can also select qualifying criteria, such as number of reviews or review rankings of a service provider. The Company’s technology is targeted for busy individuals, families and for people who need tasks completed at odd hours of the day. The Company works for any type of service from technical services (high-definition television (HDTV) to computers), auto services (dents and windshields), home services (meals to pets to babysitting), real-estate services (notaries to gardening), transportation services (packages to people) and personal services (exercise to haircuts), among others. The Company also works for non-profit organizations, institutions, city services and corporate services, such as city parades, corporate events and non-profit activities, including beach cleanup and meals on wheels. The Company competes with Craig's List, Kudzu, eBay Auctions and Penny Saver.
