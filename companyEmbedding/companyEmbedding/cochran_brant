          Represent!  These T-shirts feature the logo that started it all:  Grandpa Ferguson's original Brant & Cochran logo taken from a 1950's matchbook found in one of our old tool boxes.  It was from this design that we modeled our present "Axes from Maine" logo.  On the front of this 100% Gildan Heavy Cotton T-shirt is the Brant & Cochran logo and on the rear the B&C thistle and bee logo.

Brant & Cochran
Market Research and Business Plan Development for a New Business
Team members:  Robert Beall, Jack Marousek, Liam Fukushima
Faculty advisors:  Brian Karazsia (Psychology) and Vikki Briggs
Traditionally, AMRE projects have been based in math and computer science; however,
                        opportunities focused on entrepreneurship have been explored recently. Such is the
                        case with Brant and Cochran, an early-stage premium axe manufacturing firm. Most research
                        was delivered in a modified business plan. This consisted of conventional sections
                        such as “Products and Services” and “Marketing Research and Plan,” as well as a plan
                        for the coming twelve months. In addition, our team created financial documents and
                        projections for Brant and Cochran, including a four-year pro forma income statement
                        outlining multiple forms the company might take, along with several scenarios within
                        those forms. Competitor’s sales and income were also analyzed to estimate the total
                        market for premium axes (as measured by sales revenue and number of axes sold). We
                        also laid the groundwork for the company to begin holding focus groups to finalize
                        core user profiles, a defined product, and brand identity. Our team had a great experience
                        being so exposed to the inner workings of an early-stage startup, local businesses,
                        and the successful individuals who own and operate them.
