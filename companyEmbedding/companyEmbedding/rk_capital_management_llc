About




Randall Katz President/Owner

Founded in 2003, RK Capital Partners is a leading provider of deal origination services.  Our firm brings senior level transaction experience to every deal and offers a personalized approach not available from most other groups.
The firm was founded by Randall Katz, who previously led the business development efforts for a leading management consulting and financial advisory firm, in addition to working in the Corporate Banking Group at Bank of America in Atlanta and Washington, DC. While at Bank of America, Mr. Katz worked with clients including The Home Depot and The Coca-Cola Company.
Mr. Katz “accidentally” founded RKCP at the request of investment firms which requested his assistance with their deal origination efforts. Randall thought the projects were a one-time occurrence, however, he soon realized that he enjoyed the personal aspects of dealmaking more than “just crunching numbers”. 
Randall decided to pursue deal origination full-time in 2005 and has successfully originated numerous platform and add-on transactions across many industries including niche manufacturing, value-added distribution, business services and healthcare.
Mr. Katz received his Bachelor of Arts from Washington University in St. Louis in 1997 and attended Pace Academy in Atlanta. Mr. Katz and his wife, Erica, live in Atlanta with their 3 children.






 

 
          I have worked with a ton of buy-side guys and believe Randall and his staff are the best. RK Capital Partners conveys our story well and delivers many quality introductions.  RKCP sourced our last platform acquisition and I look forward to working with Randall on other opportunities.          
            John LeimanVice President, Pfingsten Partners

Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (NASDAQ:AIMC) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “Over the last one year, Altra Industrial's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery industry. Also, the company holds solid potential for organic and inorganic growth. For instance, the Stromag acquisition (completed in January) is predicted to be earnings accretive in 2017. Moreover, the company has been progressing well on its restructuring and cost-saving strategies. For 2017, the company raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance to $1.83-$1.93 per share from the earlier forecast of $1.75-$1.85. Revenue projection has been revised to $840-$855 million from the previous projection of $835-$855 million. However, the company is exposed to risks arising from high debt levels, stiff competition, geopolitical issues as well as adverse foreign currency movements. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock remained stable for 2017 and 2018.”
Several other research firms have also weighed in on AIMC.

Finally, BidaskClub lowered Altra Industrial Motion Corp. from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research note on Saturday, June 24th. One investment analyst  has rated the stock with a sell rating, two have given a hold rating and two have given a buy rating to the company’s stock.
