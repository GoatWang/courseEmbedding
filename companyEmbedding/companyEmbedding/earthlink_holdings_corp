Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D.

Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. The following MD&A should be read in conjunction with audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in this MD&A are forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements are described under "Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results" in this Item 7.  Overview  EarthLink Holdings Corp. ("EarthLink" or the "Company"), together with our consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading managed network, security and cloud services provider to business and residential customers in the United States. We provide a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. We also provide nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. We operate an extensive network including more than 29,000 route miles of fiber and 90 metro fiber rings that provide data and voice IP service coverage across more than 90 percent of the United States.  2015 Highlights  Key developments in our business during 2015 are described below:   Generated revenues of $1.1 billion in 2015, a 7% decrease during the year primarily driven by declines in traditional voice and data products, discontinuing sales of certain products and mandated rate reductions, partially offset by targeted price increases and increased sales of our growth products.   Reduced cost of revenues 10% during 2015, primarily due to the decline in revenues noted above as well as a concentrated effort to manage cost of revenues through network grooming, auditing telecommunications vendor invoices and other cost saving initiatives.   Generated a net loss of $43.2 million in 2015, a decrease from a net loss of $72.8 million in the prior year, which reflects an increase in Adjusted EBITDA as described below.   Generated Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in this Item 7) of $242.5 million in 2015, an increase from $213.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to improvements in our cost of revenues and operating expenses resulting from various cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the decrease in revenues noted above.   Made capital expenditures of $87.5 million in 2015, a 15% reduction from the prior year, primarily due to improving our processes and being more efficient, as well as a decrease in customer additions.   Redeemed or repurchased $126.1 million of outstanding debt for $131.3 million during 2015, and drew down $35.0 million (net of repayments) under our senior secured revolving credit facility.   Made $26.4 million of dividend payments to shareholders in 2015.  Change in Reportable Segments  We have historically operated two reportable segments, Business Services and Consumer Services. Our Business Services segment provided a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. Our Consumer Services segment provided nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. During 2015, we implemented certain organizational, operational and reporting changes that resulted in the disaggregation of our Business Services segment into three separate reportable segments: Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business and Carrier/Transport. Our Consumer Services segment was not impacted. Our new reportable segments are strategic business units aligned around distinct customer categories. We reorganized our organization around these business units to optimize operations. We believe this structure allows for better management accountability and decision making while providing greater visibility to our Chief Operating Decision Maker. We began reporting the disaggregated information to our Chief Operating Decision Maker during the third quarter of 2015. We now operate the following four reportable segments:  Table of Contents   Enterprise/Mid-Market. Our Enterprise/Mid-Market segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to distributed multi-site business customers.   Small Business. Our Small Business segment provides a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to small, often single-site business customers.   Carrier/Transport. Our Carrier/Transport segment provides transmission capacity and other data, voice and managed network services to telecommunications carriers and large enterprises.   Consumer Services. Our Consumer Services segment provides nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers.  We began recording revenue and cost of revenue transactions in the new segment structure during 2015. Management determined that it is impracticable to restate financial information prior to 2015 to conform to the new reportable segment structure due to the level of effort required to segment customers that terminated service prior to 2015 and identify the related cost of revenue associated with those customers, as this information is not currently available. As a result, our results of operations discussion focuses on the previous segment structure since we are able to present comparable periods. For more information concerning our reportable segments, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and see "Segment Results of Operations" later in this MD&A.  Sale of IT Services Assets  In February 2016, we sold certain assets related to our IT services product offerings in connection with our strategy to simplify our operations and provide more flexibility to invest in new capabilities and services to drive growth in our core business. The purchase price in the transaction was $29.0 million, subject to post-closing contingencies. We received $26.0 million of cash upon completion of the sale. The other $3.0 million of consideration was deposited into an escrow account to fund potential indemnification obligations. The loss of revenues related to our IT services product offerings will contribute to our revenue declines in 2016.  Business Strategy   Operate each of our business units with focused, value-optimizing strategies. During 2015, we aligned our organization around four distinct business units, which are Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business, Carrier/Transport and Consumer. We believe this concentrates our resources and investments into areas that will drive growth and deliver improved performance, enable each business to compete more successfully in the market and provide strategic optionality. We are focused on operating each business unit with value-optimizing strategies, which are managing the decline in our Small Business and Consumer Services business units and investing the cash flow to grow our Enterprise/Mid-Market and Carrier/Transport business units.   Optimize our cost structure and cash flows. We are focused on optimizing our cost structure and maximizing our cash flows. This includes managing our cost of revenues and operating expenses, streamlining our internal processes and aligning our workforce to current revenue trends. It also includes the repayment and/or refinancing of debt in order to reduce our interest expense. We plan to use the cash flow generated from our improvement efforts to continue to optimize our balance sheet and invest in growth.   Invest in growth business products, marketing and sales. Our growth business products are MultiProtocol Label Switching ("MPLS"), hosted voice, hybrid WAN and managed network, security and cloud services for multi-location businesses and transport services for other communications carriers and enterprises. We are focused on investing in product and service capabilities and sales and marketing initiatives to support these growth products.   Evaluate potential strategic transactions. We continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions in order to accelerate our transformation. We believe that targeted acquisitions, when available at the right economics, can be an effective means for growth and targeted capability building. In addition, we continue to evaluate our business, which could lead us to discontinue or divest non-strategic products, assets or customers based on management's assessment of their strategic value to our business.  Table of Contents  Challenges and Risks  The primary challenges we face in executing on our business strategy are growing revenues from our growth products and services; reducing churn in our existing customer base; responding to competition; aligning costs with trends in our revenues; and ensuring adequate resources to invest in growth. To address these challenges we are taking the following actions:   Targeting larger multi-location retail and service businesses which have lower churn profiles, as well as a need for our product and services   Investing in new products and service capabilities to create value for our customers, in particular our cloud-based offerings   Focusing on customer contract re-term efforts, retention offers, targeted price increases and opportunities to upsell products and services   Improving the customer experience to increase customer satisfaction and further enhance customer retention   Continuing to refine and narrow our product portfolio   Implementing cost efficiencies, such as network grooming and workforce alignment, and seeking to make costs more variable   Repaying and/or refinancing outstanding indebtedness in order to reduce interest expense   Considering further divestitures of non-strategic products, assets or customers in order to continue to simplify our operations and generate cash to reduce debt or to use for other strategic needs  Trends in our Business  Our financial results are impacted by several significant trends, which are described below.   Industry factors. The communications industry is characterized by intense competition, changing technology and changes in customer needs, an evolving regulatory environment and industry consolidation resulting in larger competitors and fewer suppliers. We expect these trends to continue. More recently, trends in the industry have included increased demand for data, evolving security threats, the adoption of cloud computing and the increased use of outsourcing. We are trying to capitalize on these changes by focusing on our managed network, security and cloud services and transport services.   Traditional business voice and data products. Our traditional business voice and data revenues have been declining due to competition, migration to more advanced integrated voice and data services and mandated rate reductions. We expect this trend to continue. We have also experienced an increase in churn for these products. However, we are focused on decelerating these declines through customer retention efforts, contract renewals, upselling products and services and offering new services.   Consumer access declines. Our consumer access subscriber base and revenues have been declining and are expected to continue to decline due to the continued maturation of the market for Internet access, competition from cable, DSL and wireless providers and limited sales and marketing activities. In addition, we have implemented, and expect to continue to implement, targeted price increases, which could negatively impact our churn rates. However, we are focused on customer retention and, as a result, we expect the rate of churn to continue to generally decline as our customer base becomes longer tenured.   Operating costs and expenses. We have experienced declines in cost of revenues and operating expense due to various cost saving initiatives and lower sales of traditional voice and data products. We are focused on continuing to optimize our cost structure to offset pressures on revenue. However, we may not be able to continue to achieve the level of cost savings we have been experiencing and there will be decreasing opportunities for cost savings in the future.   Dispute settlements. Due to the nature of our industry, we are regularly involved in disputes related to our billings to other carriers for access to our network and network access charges that we are assessed by other companies. The disputes often take significant time to resolve, and they may be resolved or require adjustment in future periods although they relate to costs and revenues in prior periods. We have experienced an increase in dispute settlements impacting revenues and cost of revenues over the past few years. However, this trend may not continue at the rate it has historically.  Table of Contents  Consolidated Results of Operations  The following table presents statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:   Year Ended December 31, 2013 2014 2015 (in thousands) Revenues $ 1,240,606 $ 1,176,895 $ 1,097,252 Operating costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 600,742 557,436 500,628 Selling, general and administrative (exclusive of of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 426,070 419,019 368,763 Depreciation and amortization 183,114 186,872 188,315 Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets 255,599 14,334 - Restructuring, acquisition and integration-related costs 40,030 20,088 19,320 Total operating costs and expenses 1,505,555 1,197,749 1,077,026 Income (loss) from operations (264,949 ) (20,854 ) 20,226 Interest expense and other, net (58,606 ) (56,261 ) (50,972 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (2,080 ) - (9,734 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (325,635 ) (77,115 ) (40,480 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (211,231 ) 4,744 (2,730 ) Loss from continuing operations (536,866 ) (72,371 ) (43,210 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (1,961 ) (381 ) - Net loss $ (538,827 ) $ (72,752 ) $ (43,210 )  Table of Contents  Revenues  We generate business services revenue by providing a broad range of data, voice and managed network services to retail and wholesale business customers. Our business services revenue includes revenues from our Enterprise/Mid-Market, Small Business and Carrier/Transport segments. We classify our business services revenue in the following three categories: (1) retail services, which includes data, voice and managed network services provided to business customers;  We generate consumer services revenue by providing nationwide Internet access and related value-added services to residential customers. We classify our consumer services revenue in two categories: (1) access services, which includes dial-up and high-speed Internet access services; and (2) value-added services, which includes revenues from ancillary services sold as add-on features to our Internet access services, such as security products, premium email only, home networking and email storage; search revenues; and advertising revenues. Revenues generally consist of recurring monthly charges for such services.  The following table presents our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:   Year Ended December 31, 2014 vs 2013 2015 vs 2014 2013 2014 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Business services Retail services $ 793,940 $ 756,747 $ 722,895 $ (37,193 ) (5)% $ (33,852 ) (4 )% Wholesale services 151,071 154,109 135,905 3,038 2% (18,204 ) (12 )% Other 19,216 20,075 19,112 859 4% (963 ) (5 )% Total revenues 964,227 930,931 877,912 (33,296 ) (3)% (53,019 ) (6 )% Consumer services Access services 231,448 202,008 173,389 (29,440 ) (13)% (28,619 ) (14 )% Value-added services 44,931 43,956 45,951 (975 ) (2)% 1,995 5 % Total revenues 276,379 245,964 219,340 (30,415 ) (11)% (26,624 ) (11 )% Total revenues $ 1,240,606 $ 1,176,895 $ 1,097,252 $ (63,711 ) (5)% $ (79,643 ) (7 )%  Business Services The following table presents the primary reasons for the changes in business services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 compared to the prior years: 2014 vs 2013 2015 vs 2014 (in millions) Due to growth products (a) $ 24.0 $ 18.6 Due to acquisitions (b) 8.3 - Due to net favorable settlements and reserve adjustments (c) 9.5 (5.5 ) Due to decline in traditional voice and data products (d) (75.1 ) (66.1 ) Total change in business services revenues $ (33.3 ) $ (53.0 ) ______________  (a) Increase due to sales of growth products, including MPLS, hosted voice and managed network services due to an increased emphasis on selling these products and services.  (b) Increase due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of CenterBeam, Inc. beginning in July 2013.  (c) Increase due to change in favorable settlements and reserve adjustments, primarily related to our billings to other carriers for access to our network, for which revenue had not been previously recognized. We recognized $1.2 million of favorable adjustments during 2013, $10.7 million of favorable adjustments during 2014 and $5.2 million of favorable adjustments during 2015.  (d) Decrease due to decline in traditional voice and data products, including traditional voice, lower-end, single site broadband  Table of Contents  services, usage and web hosting. Revenues for these voice and data products have been decreasing due to competition, migration to more advanced integrated voice and data services, customer churn and continued rate reductions as a result of FCC rules regarding intercarrier compensation. In addition, during 2015 we deemphasized and discontinued certain products that were low margin revenue streams or that were not in line with our more focused business strategy. Partially offsetting the decline in revenues from 2014 to 2015 was price increases implemented during 2015.  Consumer Services  Consumer services revenues decreased during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 compared to the prior years primarily due to the following:   Decreases in average consumer access subscribers, which were 1.1 million, 0.9 million and 0.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The decreases resulted from limited sales and marketing activities, the continued maturation of the market for Internet access and competitive pressures in the industry. However, as we continue to focus on the retention of customers, our monthly consumer subscriber churn rates were 2.1%, 2.1% and 1.9% during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, which moderated the decline in average consumer subscribers.   Partially offset by increases in our average revenue per subscriber, which was $21.83, $22.89 and $23.57 during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The increases were due to targeted price increases and a change in mix of subscribers. In addition, we began billing certain broadband subscribers for modem equipment rental in April 2014 which also contributed to the increase in average revenue per subscriber from 2013 to 2014.   Partially offset by an increase in value-added services due to price increases in our premium email only subscription product.  Cost of revenues  Cost of revenues for our business services primarily consists of the cost of connecting customers to our networks via leased facilities; the costs of leasing components of our network facilities; and costs paid to third-party providers for interconnect access and transport services.  Cost of revenues for our consumer services primarily consists of telecommunications fees and network operations costs incurred to provide our Internet access services; fees paid to suppliers of our value-added services; and fees paid to content providers for information provided on our online properties.  The following table presents our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015:   Year Ended December 31, 2014 vs 2013 2015 vs 2014 2013 2014 2015 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Business services $ 506,245 $ 469,523 $ 422,766 $ (36,722 ) (7)% $ (46,757 ) (10 )% Consumer services 94,497 87,913 77,862 (6,584 ) (7)% (10,051 ) (11 )% Total cost of revenues $ 600,742 $ 557,436 $ 500,628 $ (43,306 ) (7)% $ (56,808 ) (10 )%  Business Services The following table presents the primary reasons for the changes in business services cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 compared to the prior years: 37 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents 2014 vs 2013 2015 vs 2014 (in millions) Due to cost saving initiatives and declines in traditional products (a) $ (36.6 ) $ (48.7 ) Due to change in favorable settlements (b) (10.3 ) 1.9 Due to change in reserves for regulatory audits (c) 7.2 - Due to acquisitions (d) 3.0 - Total change in business services cost of revenues $ (36.7 ) $ (46.8 ) ______________  (a) Decrease due to a concentrated effort to manage cost of revenues through network grooming, auditing invoices and other cost saving initiatives and declines in traditional voice and data products. Partially offsetting these declines were increased sales of growth products.  (b) Decrease due to changes in favorable dispute settlements and other adjustments. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we recognized $4.4 million, $14.8 million and $12.9 million, respectively, of total favorable settlements and adjustments. Included in this amount was $4.4 million, $11.7 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of dispute settlements with telecommunications vendors recognized during the years ended December 2013, 2014 and 2015. The remaining amounts during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 were due to other settlements and adjustments.  (c) Increase in 2014 due to a $7.2 million favorable adjustment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 to decrease our reserves for regulatory audits resulting from final interpretation and resolution of certain regulatory audits, primarily an audit by the Universal Service Administrative Company on previous ITC^DeltaCom, Inc. Universal Service Fund assessments and payments.  (d) Increase due to inclusion of CenterBeam cost of revenues beginning in July 2013.  Consumer Services  Consumer services cost of revenues decreased during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 compared to the prior years primarily due to the following:   The decreases in average consumer services subscribers noted above under Consumer Services Revenues.   Partially offset by increases in our average cost per subscriber. This was due to a shift in the mix to customers with higher costs associated with delivering services and higher unit costs as our agreements with certain service providers generally have volume based tiered pricing which is leading to higher unit costs as we see a decline in subscribers over time. Also contributing to the increase from 2013 to 2014 was costs associated with modem equipment rental revenue which we began billing to certain broadband customers beginning in April 2014.  Selling, general and administrative  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses related to sales and marketing, customer service, network operations, information technology, regulatory, billing and collections, corporate administration, and legal and accounting. Such costs include salaries and related employee costs (including stock-based compensation), outsourced labor, professional fees, property taxes, travel, insurance, occupancy costs, advertising and other administrative expenses.  . . .

Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

Business[edit]
EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

EarthLink was formed in 1994. As of November 2016, it was promoting two service groups: Residential Solutions and Business Solutions.
Business Solutions sells communications, IT and virtualization, cloud computing, IT security, colocation, hosted applications and support services. The company owns and operates a U.S. network including 29,421 route miles of fiber, 90 metro fiber rings, and eight data centers. The group reports having more than 150,000 customers.[5]
EarthLink's Residential Solutions sell broadband (DSL/freestanding DSL, cable internet, 4G Internet, Satellite Internet), dial-up Internet, Web hosting and commerce, and related services. It also sells spamBlocker, Anti-virus and Online Back-up. Earthlink Internet services claim over 1 million customers.[5]
History[edit]
Early years[edit]
EarthLink was co-founded in March 1994 by Sky Dayton then 23, investor Reed Slatkin and Kevin M. O'Donnell. Dayton reportedly was inspired to start the dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) in Pasadena, CA after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton’s experience convinced him that there was a market for a simple, user-friendly ISP.[6]
Co-founder Kevin M. O'Donnell helped raise capital for the venture and urged a number of significant old friends from his government technology days to join the Board. He recruited numerous Vice Presidents for the company, and brought in the first major round of funding, from Greg B. Abbott, a successful entrepreneur and former CEO of Ithaca Industries. He also hired CEO Garry Betty.[citation needed]
By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first U.S. ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate.[7]
In 1996, EarthLink began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and frame relay Internet access[8] and web hosting.[9]
Initial public offering[edit]
EarthLink went public on NASDAQ in January 1997. Later that year, the company began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.[citation needed] EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access.[10]
In 1998, EarthLink entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.[7]
In 1999 EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce ecommerce solution for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.[7]
MindSpring merger and other acquisitions[edit]
On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL.[11] Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service.[12] EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP,[13] and Rural Connections in 2001.[citation needed]
In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a 2-way satellite Internet service.[14] The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.[15]
On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.[16]
EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003.[17] The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.[18]
New ventures[edit]
At the start of 2005, EarthLink and SK Telecom, the largest mobile phone company in South Korea,[19] announced a new joint venture called SK-EarthLink, later renamed Helio mobile phone company.[20] Helio, a new mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), targeted young, tech-savvy consumers with advanced wireless devices and services common in Korea but not the U.S. Helio launched a total of 7 phones (Kickflip, Hero, Drift, Heat, Ocean, Fin and Mysto) and had 170,000 subscribers before it was sold to Virgin Mobile USA in June 2008.[21]
In July 2005, EarthLink closed its in-house call centers to reduce costs.[22]
In August 2005, Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of Anti-Spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.[23]
In October 2005, Philadelphia, PA,[24] and Anaheim, CA, selected EarthLink to build their municipal Wi-Fi networks.[25] EarthLink's Municipal Networks division would launch public wi-fi networks in Anaheim, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Milpitas, CA,[26] and win several more municipal contracts before EarthLink decided to exit the muni wi-fi business by the end of 2007.[27]
EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice[28] and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.[29]
In April 2006, EarthLink acquired New Edge Networks, a provider of network and communication services for businesses.[30] In June, the EarthLink’s Municipal Networks division launched the company’s first citywide Wi-Fi network in Anaheim, CA.[31]
In September 2014, the company partnered with Tech Data to provide a Desktop as a Service cloud offering.[32]
New business acquisitions[edit]
In October 2010, EarthLink acquired ITC Deltacom, a telecom service provider with 32,000 customers.[33]
In December 2010 EarthLink acquired One Communications, one of the largest privately held integrated telecom solutions providers in the U.S.[34]
In March 2011 EarthLink also acquired STS Telecom, a privately held business in Florida and Georgia.[35] STS Telecom was integrated into the new EarthLink Business division, along with the recently acquired One Communications and Deltacom, New Edge Networks, and EarthLink’s legacy Business Solutions.
In May 2011 the company created a new EarthLink Carrier division for wholesale customers with fiber-based transport, voice and data service, and switched services.[36]
Also in May, EarthLink acquired LogicalSolutions.net, an enterprise data center solution and cloud services provider.[37]
In August EarthLink acquired Business Vitals, a provider of IT security and professional services.[38] EarthLink also acquired xDefenders, a managed IT security company.[39]
EarthLink also purchased IT Solution Center and cloud-based application business from Synergy Global Solutions in 2011.[40]
In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.[41]
Business network and data center expansion[edit]
In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.[citation needed]
Leadership[edit]
On November 21, 2006, EarthLink reported that its CEO, Garry Betty, was diagnosed with a serious form of cancer which would have required him to take an undetermined leave of absence. The company's Board of Directors named Mike Lunsford, Vice-President of Voice and Access, as interim CEO. Betty died on January 2, 2007.[42][43] On June 25, 2007, EarthLink named Rolla Huff its President and CEO. On January 29, 2008, EarthLink announced that Rolla Huff would replace Robert Kavner as Chairman of the Board.[44] In January 2014, Joseph F. Eazor replaced Rolla Huff as President and CEO.[45]
Criticism[edit]
In February 2016, USA Today's Steven Petrow wrote that his EarthLink email account got compromised during a flight while using the in-flight WLAN onboard.[46] This was possible because EarthLink does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for the login on its POP3 services. As an alternative, the company recommended customers to use encryption services on IMAP or through EarthLink's Web Mail.[47]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In October 1996, EarthLink was named "Internet Company of the Year" by the Southern California Software Industry Council.[48]
In 2000, the company won PC World's World Class Award for Best ISP.[49]
In 2002, the company was named Top ISP by CNet for the 3rd consecutive year and received a 5-star rating from Smart Business.[50] Also in 2002, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink Dial-Up Highest in Customer Satisfaction. EarthLink High-Speed tied for the Highest in Customer Satisfaction ranking.[51]
In August 2003, J.D. Power and Associates ranked EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction for the second consecutive year.[52]
In September 2004, J.D. Power and Associates ranked both EarthLink Dial-Up and EarthLink High Speed Highest in Customer Satisfaction.[53] EarthLink Dial-Up also received the PC Magazine Readers' Choice Award for the second year in a row.[50]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
