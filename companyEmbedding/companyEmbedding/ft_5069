                    Arizona's Rim Country is a short 90 miles north of the Phoenix Metro Valley. Our area offers four mild seasons, a ponderosa pine forest, an abundance of outdoor recreation and a variety of wildlife.  The Pine/Strawberry area is Arizona's hidden treasure. The area has several marvelous independently owned restaurants, antique stores, artist galleries, and hiking and mountain bicycle trails; all surrounded by the Tonto National Forest. Imagine sitting on the deck of your new cabin in the cool pines watching deer and elk grazing in your yard.

Great













See some of the reviews here.

 Excellent service 
 Excellent service. 
Ordered Vera Wong frame which was half price here. Was suspicious it could be fake considering the price discount but the frame was genuine. The metal on the frame had designer engraving, the case and cloth designer logo. Unfortunately, the frame didn’t suit me and reluctantly, after thorough consideration, I decided to return it. The return went smoothly and refund was issued promptly. Both delivery and return was free. Would recommend the company to anyone and will use it again myself.

 couldn't be happier 
 after I found some prescription sunglasses I wanted at Boots I thought I would have a look online before I brought them and found them on smartbuyglasses for £100 less. only after I placed the order I read reviews and I have to say I was a bit worried as there were a lot of bad ones and I ever thought about cancelling the order but I thought I would risk it for the sake of £90.
they turned up today after only 10 days and I couldn't be happier with them I would recommend this company to anyone , unfortunately people tend to only leave reviews when they are unhappy! and I read 2 or 3 saying the glasses were fake copies which is ridicules and simply not true!
