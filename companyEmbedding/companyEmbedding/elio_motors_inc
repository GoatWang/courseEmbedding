Start-Up Vehicle Manufacturer Elio Motors Inc. Chooses IQMS ERP as Single System for Process Management
Elio Motors is aligning deployment of IQMS ERP system with setup of manufacturing facility for new up to 84 MPG, three-wheel vehicle to gain real-time insights and coordinate processes at the factory and HQ
 
PASO ROBLES, CALIF. – February 16, 2016 –IQMS manufacturing ERP software and manufacturing execution system (MES) authority, today announced that start-up vehicle manufacturer Elio Motors Inc. has selected IQMS’ flagship product, EnterpriseIQ. Elio Motors, which is anticipating the roll out its highly fuel-efficient, three-wheeled vehicle in late 2016, is implementing EnterpriseIQ to provide a single system for managing the company’s processes and obtaining complete, accurate information to support decision-making.
Since it was founded in 2009, Elio Motors’ vision has been to reinvent transportation by designing a safe, fun-to-drive, affordable, and environmentally friendly vehicle. The result is the aerodynamically designed Elio, a three-wheeled, two-seat vehicle, projected to achieve up to 84 MPG for a targeted $6,800* base price.. With a commitment to delivering American-made vehicles, production is to take place in a former GM production facility in Shreveport, La.
During the initial years of design, development and testing, Elio Motors relied on different applications to manage the company’s processes. Finance used a combination of QuickBooks and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, while marketing maintained a separate database for customer information. To date, reconciling the information manually has not required significant time, however, the current model would not be sufficient for the growth Elio Motors anticipates once the company moves into production.
Elio Motors recognized the need for a single system for managing all of its processes, from finance and marketing to manufacturing, engineering, quality, training and human resources. Elio Motors also realized that it would be a strategic advantage to plan and implement its manufacturing system in conjunction with the setup of its manufacturing operations even as the company used the software to support its existing business needs. Last, in evaluating software, Elio Motors sought a solution to the challenges that various team members had experienced with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems at previous companies. A review of leading ERP solutions on the market led to IQMS and its EnterpriseIQ software.
“We appreciated that IQMS had a specific focus on the automotive industry, and we viewed the real-time production monitoring portion to be the true strength of the system—especially how it interfaces with the rest of the system to allow for quick, up to date, in-depth review of the production floor,” said Shane Stirmers, finance manager for Elio Motors Inc. “Additionally, EnterpriseIQ will require limited modifications for us to use as the backbone of the company, and there is considerable flexibility in the system, which will allow us to grow.”
Equally important, Stirmers noted, “Our mission at Elio Motors to provide an efficient, cost-effective, American-based solution for our customers is consistent with the team at IQMS. This philosophical alignment, combined with a solution that can evolve with us to address future challenges, provides us the confidence that IQMS is the provider best prepared to deliver on our business goals.”
*Starting MSRP excludes options, destination/delivery charge, taxes, title and registration.
Anticipated production date is based upon timely receipt of requisite funding.

The 4 Must Haves
Before we even put design pen to paper, these four Elio “Must-haves” were etched
                indelibly in our minds and hearts. Here are the results:







Must-have 1: Amazing MPG



                                While other vehicles make their competitive claims within a few MPGs of one another, we needed Elio to take
                                it to the stratosphere. As we continue to engineer the Elio for up to 84 MPG, we officially have liftoff.
                            











Must-have 2: Uncompromised Safety



                                Elio is engineered to the highest safety standards. Each Elio comes equipped with a Safety Management System that includes three airbags – a unibody frame, Anti-Lock Braking System, and 50% larger crush zones than similar vehicles. Watch video.












Must-have 3: All-American Pedigree



                                Elio is American-made targeting utilization of 90% North American content, and we have re-engineered existing technology
                                throughout. That means no trial and error anywhere. Just tried and true everywhere.
                            











Must-have 4: Low Price



                                It seems like everything just costs more today. Houses, cars, heck, even a gallon of milk and a box of cereal. At Elio Motors, we believe wallets need a break. A new vehicle targeted $7,450* base price is not just what people want. It’s what they need.
                            





*MSRP excludes destination/delivery charges, taxes, title, registration, and options/installation.

Green Impact and Economics







Elio, the Environment, and Passing Gas.

                               At up to 84 MPG you’ll be passing gas pumps in your Elio all day long. Which also means you’ll be
                                putting far less pollutants in the air than even the most environmentally-friendly cars. Multiply
                                that times the number of Elios projected to be sold, and America could save almost 3.5 billion
                                gallons of fuel per year, while reducing harmful CO2 emissions by more than 69 billion pounds.
                            








Oh, and speaking of passing gas, our in-house science geeks inform us that Elio will emit even less harmful
                                emissions in the atmosphere per year than the average flatulent cow. Which from what we understand about
                                cows, is a pretty impressive claim in itself.
                            










Colors





                                True Blue, Marshmallow, Red Hot, Rocket Silver, Sour Apple, Licorice, and Creamsicle. Sure, you might know them as Blue, White, Red, Silver, Green, Black, and Orange. But, what fun would that be? At Elio Motors, we’ve developed a palette of colors that turn heads...we thought they deserved a description that’s as fun and unique as the Elio!

The need for ePlus
Traditionally, the options packages created by auto manufacturers force customers to pay for options they don’t want or need. On the other hand, the automotive aftermarket offers a myriad of options, but they may not be properly vetted for fit and quality and may also be expensive to install.
The vision for ePlus
ePlus: My Elio My Way connects the end consumer with our vast supplier network, allowing for “mass personalization," which has never been accomplished before. Customers can now choose – and pay for – only the options they want and need on their Elio. Elio Motors will deliver a well-equipped base model, but will also provide customers the capability to personalize the vehicle with options based on their own unique driver experience.
How ePlus works
Not only will Elio owners be able to personalize their vehicle when it goes into production utilizing the ePlus: My Elio My Way system, starting now, we will continually add innovative new options from our supplier partners that can be voted on or considered for future purchase via the configurator below. By customizing your vehicle now, it lets us know the options that are most desired by our future Elio owners.




To get started:

Click on "Launch Configurator" button below
Next, click on an options category on the left
Select the specific option on the right that you would like to add to the vehicle
Review the image with your options added and continue adding or removing options to customize your Elio
You can also view additional images and information to help you learn more about the option you are selecting by simply mousing over the information button next to each option

The estimated cost for your customized Elio with all of the options you selected will appear at the top of the configurator screen. You can also click on the "Summary" button on the left to see the itemized list. Once you have created your Elio just the way you want it, print, email, or share it via social media by clicking on the buttons in the lower right corner of the screen.
If there is an accessory you do not see but would like to have it available for your Elio, please send us your wish list at [email protected].com.

*Options prices subject to change and the final price excludes destination/delivery charge, taxes, title and registration. Options are a sampling for demonstration purposes only.

Your local gas pump does not want
                                you to read this.
Let’s do the fuel economy math. Say you’re getting 22 MPG in your
                                primary vehicle. Say you commute about 12,000 miles per year back
                                and forth to work. At 4 bucks a gallon that’s roughly $2,100 per year.
                                Ouch.
                            

                                So you add an Elio to your driveway. Same 12,000 miles, same 4
                                bucks. Only now you’re only pumping about $798 per year.
                                Subtract the yearly difference (about $1,300) from your yearly
                                payments on your Elio (About $1,550) and your Elio is costing about
                                the same as a medium latte’ a week habit.
                            

                                But wait, there’s less. Because you still get to factor in the costly
                                wear and tear and depreciation you save by knocking 12,000 miles
                                per year off your primary vehicle, which would be about 5 times that
                                of the Elio.
                            

                                Bottom line, your Elio pays for itself… or more accurately,
                                your local gas pump does.

How are you going to "Alter the Course" of personal transportation?
































Be a part of automotive history. Between March 1998 and 2013, the U.S. lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs. 
                            These statistics didn't just alarm Paul Elio. They moved him to take action.
                        









How it all began

                        The world believes U.S. innovation and vehicle manufacturing is dead, and unfortunately a lot of Americans agree. 
                        Should we wave the white flag and let more jobs leave our shores? In 2009 Paul Elio said no, and 
                        Elio Motors was born.












Did you know?

Over 76% of Americans drive solo to work everyday
There are over 90 million old clunkers on the road today averaging less than 20 MPG

We can do better! Americans need the ultra fuel-efficient, highly affordable, and incredibly safe Elio.











The Elio: American innovation at its finest

U.S. made by American workers at the former GM plant in Shreveport, Louisiana 
Designed targeting utilization of 90% North American content.
A collaboration of the finest automobile suppliers in the world
Led by the 'Who’s Who' of the transportation industry

Simple, ingenious innovation using current technology. Its about time.

                        We also collect and store Non-Personal Information, such as visitor traffic, page hits, site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links.

Innovation: The Product of Perseverance | Elio Motors
February 16, 2016
Innovation takes time. And that’s the way it should be. In the age of instant gratification, patience is a vanishing virtue. But what if the great innovators throughout the course of history became impatient and equated a delay with failure? Famed scientist Louis Pasteur is quoted as saying “Let me tell you the secret that has led to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.”
Today, Thomas Edison is thought of as the quintessential inventor. Edison held over 1,000 patents and is largely remembered for his invention of the phonograph, the electric lightbulb, and the motion picture camera. However, Edison faced much adversity along the way. As a young student, teachers found him to be difficult and he was subsequently homeschooled. Before he was able to produce the first commercially viable electric lightbulb, Edison and his team “tested more than 6,000 materials before finding one that fit the bill.” Edison is quoted as saying “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” Edison’s perseverance in the name of innovation changed the modern world.

Tesla Motors is a household name, but was relatively unknown at the time of its incorporation in 2003. It wasn’t until 2006 that Tesla displayed its first prototype to the public. “Patience is a virtue, and I’m learning patience. It’s a tough lesson,” Elon Musk told Wired in 2008. Tesla’s Model X was unveiled on February 9th, 2012 and production was set to begin by the end of 2013. Then came the delays: from late 2013 to late 2014, to the 3rd quarter of 2015. The delays did not curb the enthusiasm of prospective customers. By February 2015, it was reported over 20,000 reservations were made to purchase a Model X and deliveries finally began in September 2015.
Tesla’s perseverance in the name of innovation is paying great dividends. On the day Tesla went public on June 29th, 2010, the share price was $17.00. On March 1st, 2013, after the delay was announced, the price was $34.65. By the end of 2015, the stock price of Tesla rose to $240 a share. CNN Money has estimated that Tesla is worth $25 billion. Musk has predicted that by 2025, Tesla could be worth $700 billion.
The tenacious spirit exhibited by Edison and Musk is not limited to the manufacturing world. In late 2009, a film took America by storm, but the seeds were planted in 1994 when James Cameron wrote the treatment for Avatar. The initial intention was to begin production in 1997 for a 1999 release.
Delays, however, began to set in. Cameron refused to compromise on his vision, and wanted the absolute best technology to be available for his film. After they considered abandoning the project, 20th Century Fox finally committed to Cameron. One executive reportedly told him, “I don’t know if we’re crazier for letting you do this, or if you’re crazier for thinking you can do this.”
Some writers wondered if Avatar would be a failure, one even going so far to ponder if Avatar would be the biggest flop of all time. Another release date was set for May 22, 2009, but was pushed back yet again. The film was released in the United States on December 18th, 2009, 15 years after Cameron had written the treatment. Avatar went on to demolish box office records and became one of the highest grossing film of all time, grossing more than $2.7 billion.
Innovation is not simply the end result of a vision, but the culmination of a revolutionary idea, the execution of that idea, and time. Delays in the course of the development of an innovative idea are not failures. Thomas Edison, Elon Musk, and James Cameron fought long and hard to turn their ideas into realities and were undeterred by delays. The results of innovation are not always on a timeline that produces instant gratification, but the effects can be felt for generations.

                        We also collect and store Non-Personal Information, such as visitor traffic, page hits, site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links.

                        preaching to the choir. Here’s the schedule:

Retail Centers








                                             Proposed Elio Retail Centers
                                            







                                                We’re planning a network of stand-alone Retail Centers in the top 60 markets across the country. 
                                                Larger markets will have more than one location. These proposed centers will be as refreshingly 
                                                different as the vehicle itself. Stay tuned for updates as finalized locations are released.
                                            











                                            Your Elio Retail Experience
                                            






The Elio retail experience won’t follow the crowd, but it’s certain to attract one. 
                                            Think “genius-bar” as opposed to in-your-face plaid jacket high pressure. 
                                            For starters our future Retail Centers will be staffed and operated by Elio-trained 
                                            certified specialists –people you can trust to know your Elio inside and out. 
                                            Plus, everyone will get the same great price, which will eliminate the old-school 
                                            haggling element found in traditional dealerships.
                                        

                                            We’ll also offer plenty of custom options just in case you want to infuse your Elio with some 
                                            extra personality. We can’t wait to see what you might have in mind.
                                        







                                            Ordering Your Elio
                                            






                                            Ordering your Elio at the Retail Center will be seamless and intuitive. 
                                            We will have computers you can access on site along with and some techy interactive kiosks, 
                                            all programmed to connect you and the Elio you were born to drive.
                                        

                                            Our specialists will assist you through your selections, including body color, 
                                            manual or automatic, and any extra customization you have in mind via our ePlus: My Elio. My Way. mass personalization program. 
                                            Feel free to ask questions along the way. They will be on hand for one purpose, 
                                            to make sure you get your Elio your way.
                                        

                                            When you finish ordering, you might even want to just hang out a while longer 
                                            and take it all in. Please do. Coffee will be on us.
                                        







                                            Payment Options
                                            






                                            Your Elio can be purchased by traditional methods. You may have the opportunity
                                            to drive off with no money down, using a unique Elio credit card payment plan. 
                                            The plan allows you to pay for your Elio over time when you charge fuel. Each time, 
                                            there will be an extra charge equal to twice the fuel amount that automatically applies to the vehicle price. 
                                            Think of it this way: For about what you have been paying to fuel your existing vehicle, you can fuel your Elio and buy it too!
                                        







                                            Delivery
                                            






                                            Once you order, you’re going to want it in your hands as soon as humanly possible. 
                                            How does 24 hours sound? That’s right. We’re talking clean and ready with all the extras – 
                                            waiting at the Retail Center – within 24 hours* of your order.
                                        
* The Vehicle Wrap option does not apply to the 24 hour delivery. 







                                            Hang in There
                                            






                                            The momentum is huge. We have a breakthrough vehicle, a plant to build it in, 
                                            and we’re poised to hire an American work force of 1,500 to produce it. Plus, 
                                            we have thousands of Elio reservation holders and counting. So now you just want your Elio. 
                                            We understand, and we want you to have it too. So keep the adrenaline up, 
                                            because your place in automotive history has almost arrived.
                                        

                                            Your Elio Team!
                                        













Service Centers



An iconic brand signs on
Pep Boys (Yes THAT Pep Boys) is the anticipated "Official Service Center." It’s no small thing to win the confidence of this leading national service brand. With 800 locations in 35 states and Puerto Rico, as the anticipated service provider, Pep Boys will provide Elio Motors' customers a full range of service options from one of the most trusted names in the automotive aftermarket.
                    
We are also working with Pep Boys to develop ways of bringing solid service options to Elio owners in areas where Pep Boys stores are not present. As you read this, our guys and theirs are deeply immersed in developing the game plan. So as soon as all the i’s and t’s are dotted and crossed, we’ll go public with the details.
                    
Meanwhile, you can be sure the best interests of Elio owners will be driving every decision.

Elio Motors 3-Wheeler: 84 MPG for the Price of a Decade-Old Corolla
 
 Click on the link above to see it on Car and Driver.com

Sure, it’s great that manufacturers are offering fuel-economy specials of existing compact and subcompact, non-hybridized models. Not only does such a concept improve mileage without compromising driving dynamics by adding heavy batteries and electric motors, but they’re cheap when compared to their gas-electric brethren, too. That’s why we’re intrigued by Elio Motors, a startup promising a brand-new fuel-miser for the cost of a decade-old Toyota Corolla. 
 
Yes, for the low, low cost of $6800, you can have yourself an Elio 3-Wheeler: a two-seat three-wheeler powered by a 900-cc three-cylinder that’s estimated to deliver 84 mpg on the highway. Elio says that its eight-gallon fuel tank is enough to get one of its cars from Detroit to New York, some 650 miles away, without refueling.
 
Founder Paul Elio believes that at this price point, his brand could see annual sales of 250,000. To help meet this goal, Elio purchased a million-square-foot manufacturing facility in Shreveport, Louisiana, formerly inhabited by General Motors.So far, Elio has received more than 12000 orders. That’s nowhere near the brand’s theoretical production capacity, but it’s not an insignificant number for an automaker that’s yet to sell a single car. With production expected to begin this December, we’ll be eager to see how that number grows.

How are you going to "Alter the Course" of personal transportation?
































Be a part of automotive history. Between March 1998 and 2013, the U.S. lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs. 
                            These statistics didn't just alarm Paul Elio. They moved him to take action.
                        









How it all began

                        The world believes U.S. innovation and vehicle manufacturing is dead, and unfortunately a lot of Americans agree. 
                        Should we wave the white flag and let more jobs leave our shores? In 2009 Paul Elio said no, and 
                        Elio Motors was born.












Did you know?

Over 76% of Americans drive solo to work everyday
There are over 90 million old clunkers on the road today averaging less than 20 MPG

We can do better! Americans need the ultra fuel-efficient, highly affordable, and incredibly safe Elio.











The Elio: American innovation at its finest

U.S. made by American workers at the former GM plant in Shreveport, Louisiana 
Designed targeting utilization of 90% North American content.
A collaboration of the finest automobile suppliers in the world
Led by the 'Who’s Who' of the transportation industry

Simple, ingenious innovation using current technology. Its about time.

                        We also collect and store Non-Personal Information, such as visitor traffic, page hits, site referral information, browser information, downloads, and general Site use information through typical Internet data collection tools, such as web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links.

(ALPP), a technology and manufacturing holding company initially targeting the national automobile dealership market, announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Elio Motors Inc. (ELIO) to provide the innovative high mileage vehicle manufacturer its 6th Sense Auto™ and BrakeActive products, as well as related manufacturing, data sharing and engineering resources.Elio Motors, based in Phoenix, is a high-profile startup vehicle manufacturer planning to launch an ultra-efficient, two-person three-wheel vehicle, the Elio, that will get up to 84 mpg with a set base price of $7,300*. The Elio, to be sold initially in the U.S. market, will be built at a former General Motors plant in Shreveport, LA. More than 64,000 customer reservations have been recorded for the Elio and the Company anticipates commercial mass production to begin in 2018.Strong current demand is reflected by over 64,000 customer reservations. Management anticipates assembling the 100 S1 prototypes for real-world evaluation during 2017 with commercial mass production to follow in 2018.The LOI between Alpine 4 and Elio Motors also includes the sharing of such things as sales data and user acceptance, and all data collected from the cloud-based 6th Sense Auto System. 6th Sense Auto is designed for the modern "connected car" and collects data on such things as inventory management, engine diagnostics, service maintenance and personalized customer support through wireless software.BrakeActive is an innovative, high-margin aftermarket programmable brake-light safety device. Its technology improves a vehicle's third brake light in order to substantially reduce or prevent rear-end collisions. According to the National Highway Safety Administration, rear-end collisions can be reduced by 90 percent if trailing vehicles have one additional second to react. BrakeActive assists in providing that extra time to react."We are putting together a team of world-class suppliers that are helping us meet our stringent cost, fuel efficiency, safety and performance goals," said Paul Elio, CEO of Elio Motors. "To create the most advanced vehicles on the global market in terms of modern engineering, rider comforts and fuel efficiency, we need suppliers like Alpine 4's subsidiary ALTIA and their cloud-based innovations and safety products."Both the Sixth Sense Auto product platform and the BrakeActive products are manufactured and engineered in-house by Alpine 4's subsidiary ALTIA."Creating a business relationship with an OEM vehicle manufacturer like Elio Motors is an important milestone for Alpine 4," said Alpine 4 CEO Kent B. Wilson. "Our goal is to provide our product portfolio to a variety of customers in the automotive industry. We are very excited to be working with such an important and high-profile company like Elio Motors, which promises to be a world leader in the high-efficiency subcompact market."About Elio MotorsFounded by car enthusiast Paul Elio in 2009, Elio Motors Inc. represents a revolutionary approach to manufacturing an ultra-high-mileage vehicle.
