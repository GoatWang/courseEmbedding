	1.






	NATURE
	OF OPERATIONS







	 





	Organization





	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. on April 21, 2006.




	 





	Exploration
	Stage Activities





	 




	The
	Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining
	claims. Upon location of a commercial minable reserve, the Company expects to actively prepare the site for its extraction and
	enter a development stage. During the fiscal year 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Mayan Mineral Ltd. to acquire
	a resource property in Nevada (Note 4). Currently, the Company is actively looking for other mineral properties for its planned
	business operation.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	These
	unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States of America (“US GAAP”) applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
	satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.




	 




	The
	general business strategy of the Company is to acquire and explore mineral properties. The continued operations of the Company
	and the recoverability of mineral property costs is dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable mineral reserves,
	the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to complete the development of its properties, and upon future profitable
	production. The Company has not generated any revenues or completed development of any properties to date. Further, the Company
	has a working capital deficit of $508,699 (June 30, 2016 - $504,817), has incurred losses of $615,759 since inception, and further
	significant losses are expected to be incurred in the exploration and development of its mineral properties. The Company will
	require additional funds to meet its obligations and maintain its operations. There can be no guarantee that the Company will
	be successful in raising the necessary financing. Management’s plans in this regard are to raise equity financing as required.




	 




	These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited interim financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.




	 







	2.






	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	 




	The
	unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Because a precise determination
	of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily
	involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates. The unaudited
	interim financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality
	and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below.

	(Stated
	in U.S. Dollars)






	(Unaudited)





	 







	2.






	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)







	 






	 




	a)




	Cash






	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
	There are no cash equivalents as at December 31, 2016 (June 30, 2016: $nil).




	 






	 




	b)




	Mineral
	Property Acquisition Payments






	 




	The
	Company expenses all costs incurred on mineral properties to which it has secured exploration rights prior to the establishment
	of proven and probable reserves. If and when proven and probable reserves are determined for a property and a feasibility study
	prepared with respect to the property, then subsequent exploration and development costs of the property will be capitalized.




	 




	The
	Company regularly performs evaluations of any investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability and/or the residual
	value of its investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change
	which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.




	 






	 




	c)




	Exploration
	Expenditures






	 




	The
	Company follows a policy of expensing exploration expenditures until a production decision in respect of the project and the Company
	is reasonably assured that it will receive regulatory approval to permit mining operations, which may include the receipt of a
	legally binding project approval certificate.




	 






	 




	d)




	Asset
	Retirement Obligations






	 




	The
	Company has adopted ASC 410, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, which requires that an asset retirement
	obligation (“ARO”) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recognized as a liability in the
	period which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated asset.




	 




	The
	cost of the tangible asset, including the initially recognized ARO, is depleted, such that the cost of the ARO is recognized over
	the useful life of the asset. The ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted
	liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash flow,
	discounted at the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. To date, no significant asset retirement obligation
	exists due to the early stage of exploration. Accordingly, no liability has been recorded.

	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)







	 






	 




	e)




	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions






	 




	The
	preparation of unaudited interim financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
	principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 






	 




	f)




	Financial
	Instruments






	 




	ASC
	820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
	the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,
	objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the
	fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes
	the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




	 




	Level
	1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;




	 




	Level
	2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and




	 




	Level
	3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions
	about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.




	 




	The
	Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, loan payable and
	due to a related party. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which
	consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all of the other
	financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.




	 




	The
	Company’s operations are in Canada, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The
	financial risk is the risk to the Company’s operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree
	of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency
	risk.

	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)







	 






	 




	g)




	Income
	Taxes






	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and ASC 740 —Accounting
	for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which require the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method requires
	the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
	statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.




	 






	 




	h)




	Basic
	and Diluted Net Loss per Share






	 




	The
	Company reports basic loss per share in accordance with ASC 260 – “Earnings per Share”. Basic loss per share
	is computed using the weighted average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed
	using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss
	per share is equal to basic loss per share because there are no potential dilutive securities.




	 






	 




	i)




	Foreign
	Currency Translation






	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
	the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated
	into U.S. dollars at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are translated at the historical rate unless
	such items are carried at market value, in which case they are translated using exchange rates that existed when the value were
	determined. Any resulting exchange rate differences are recorded in the statement of operations.

	RECENT
	ADOPTED AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS








	 





	In
	May 2015, the FASB issued guidance to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for
	which fair value is measured using net asset value per share practical expedient. The guidance is effective for the Company in
	the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of the new guidance, effective for the quarter beginning
	October 1, 2016, had no impact on the Company’s balance sheets or statements of operations or cash flows.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued guidance on how to account for and disclose going concern risk. The guidance is effective for the
	Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting
	this new accounting guidance on its financial statements.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions
	including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement

	RECENT
	ADOPTED AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (Continued)








	 





	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets. Under the new
	guidance, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The new guidance
	also modifies the impairment models for available for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration
	since their origination. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and earlier adoption is
	permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on its financial statements.

	MANAGEMENT
	DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS




	 




	 For
	the Period Ended




	 




	 DECEMBER
	31, 2016






	 






	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.





	 




	This
	section of the quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to
	future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate,
	anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place
	undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking
	statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical
	results or our predictions.




	 





	Plan
	of Operation





	 




	We
	are a start-up, exploration Stage Corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations.




	 




	Our
	auditors have issued a going concern opinion during the year end audit. This means there is substantial doubt that we can continue
	as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have
	not generated any revenues and do not anticipate generating any revenues until we begin removing and selling minerals. There is
	no assurance we will ever achieve these goals. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than the sale of minerals in
	order to implement our project and stay in business. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others.




	 




	Our
	exploration target is to find a mineralized material, specifically, an ore body containing gold. Our success depends upon finding
	mineralized material. This includes a determination by our consultant that the property contains reserves. We have not yet selected
	a consultant. Mineralized material is a mineralized body which has been delineated by appropriate spaced drilling or underground
	sampling to support sufficient tonnage and average grade of metals to justify removal. If we don’t find mineralized material
	or if it is not economically feasible to remove it, we will cease operations and you will lose your investment.




	 




	In
	addition, we may not have enough money to complete the acquisition and exploration of a property. If it turns out that we have
	not raised enough money to complete our acquisition we will try to raise additional funds from a second public offering, a private
	placement or through loans. At the present time, we have not made any plans to raise additional money and there is no assurance
	that we would be able to raise additional money in the future. If we need additional money and cannot raise it, we will have to
	suspend or cease operations.




	 





	Research
	& Development






	 





	As
	an exploration stage company in the mining industry we are not involved in any research and development.





	 






	Effects
	of Compliance with Environmental Laws






	 





	As
	a company in the mining industry we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. We strive to comply with all applicable
	environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are currently taking the steps indicated above. We believe that our operations
	are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations on environmental matters. These laws and regulations, on federal, state
	and local levels, are evolving and frequently modified and we cannot predict accurately the effect, if any, they will have on
	its business in the future. In many instances, the regulations have not been finalized, or are frequently being modified. Even
	where regulations have been adopted, they are subject to varying and contradicting interpretations and implementation. In some
	cases, compliance can only be achieved by capital expenditure and we cannot accurately predict what capital expenditures, if any,
	may be required.





	 









	15










	 








	 






	Limited
	Operating History; Need for Additional Capital





	 




	There
	is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage
	corporation and have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations.
	Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources,
	possible delays in the acquisition and exploration of our properties, and possible cost overruns due to price increases in services.




	 




	To
	become profitable and competitive, we need to identify a property and conduct research and explore our property before we start
	production of any minerals we may find. If we do find mineralized material, we will need additional funding to move beyond the
	research and exploration stage. We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing
	is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could
	result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	We
	have completed our public offering as of March 28, 2007 and to date have raised $107,060, we will attempt to raise additional
	money through a subsequent private placement, public offering or through loans.




	 




	Currently,
	we do not have sufficient funds for our intended business operation. Ms. Miller, one of our officers and directors, has agreed
	in financing the related operating expenditures to maintain the Company. The foregoing agreement is oral; we have nothing in writing.
	While Ms. Miller has agreed to advance the funds, the agreement is unenforceable as a matter of law because no consideration was
	given. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash. If we need additional cash and can’t
	raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described
	in this paragraph, we have no other financing plans.




	 




	Since
	inception, we have issued 7,070,000 shares of our common stock and received $107,060.




	 




	In
	April 2006, we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Kathrine MacDonald, our former secretary/treasurer, in consideration
	of $30 and we issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Marilyn Miller, one of our officers and directors, in consideration of
	$30 pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1993.




	 




	We
	issued 1,070,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in section 4(2) of the Securities
	Act of 1933. This was accounted for as a purchase of shares of common stock.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016 due to related parties balance of $82,959 (September 30, 2015: $82,959) represents the combination of the
	following:




	 






	 




	a)




	$54,959
	(June 30, 2016: $54,959) owed to a company controlled by a former director and principal shareholder of the Company, for the

	non-interest bearing and due on demand;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	b)




	$28,000

	is unsecured, interest-bearing at 12% per annum and due on demand. For the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the vendors

	Summary






	 





	The
	following is a description of the Company’s mineral properties. The Company holds a 100% interest on four contiguous Federal
	BLM unpatented lode mining claims in Nevada that were acquired for mineral exploration purposes, primarily in exploration for
	precious metals.




	 





	The
	Property






	 





	The
	four GSR lode mining claims, named GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4, were staked on Federal BLM lands on July 9, 2012 by Kee Nez Resources, LLC,
	a Utah limited liability company.


	The BLM claim
	numbers for claims GSR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 1076314, 1076315, 1076316 and 1076317 respectively. Each of the four claims are 20.66
	acres in size for a total of 82.64 acres.




	 




	The
	Company acquired these unpatented claims on August 15, 2013, from Kee Nez Resources, LLC, who quitclaimed the four claims to the
	Company. This transfer was filed and recorded with the BLM on August 23, 2013. As a result, Golden Star Resource Corp. holds a
	100% interest in the four claims. There are no underlying agreements or royalties.




	 




	A
	Maintenance Fee or a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification must be filed annually on or before September 1st in order to keep the
	claims valid and is filed in advance for the upcoming assessment year. Since the Company holds less than 10 Federal unpatented
	lode mining claims it is entitled to file a Maintenance Fee Waiver Certification in lieu of paying the fee of $155 per claim.
	Payment of the Maintenance Fee or filing of the Fee Waiver Certification is the responsibility of Golden Star Resource Corp. Notice
	of Holding of these claims is also filed annually with Churchill County.




	All
	requirements have been met until the next annual due date of September 1, 2016.




	 




	There
	are no buildings, equipment or other facilities on the claims. Sources of power and water have not been investigated to date.




	 




	The
	Company only has mineral rights by virtue of these claims. It does not hold any surface rights.




	 





	Location





	 




	The
	GSR 1-4 unpatented lode mining claims are situated in Sections 9 and 16, T14N, R35E, MDM, in Churchill County, Nevada.




	 




	The
	property is located 98 air miles southeast of Reno, NV and 48 air miles southeast of Fallon, NV. The property can be accessed
	from Fallon by heading east on US Hwy 50 for 46 miles and then heading south on NV 361 for 15 miles. This paved highway cuts across
	the southeast corner of the claim group (see Fig 2).

	Geology






	 





	The
	GSR property lies in the Basin and Range Province near its western margin where it adjoins the northwest-southeast trending Walker
	Lane mineral belt. This boundary is about 20 miles west of the GSR property. The Basin and Range Province is a major physiographic
	region of the western US, centered on Nevada and western Utah, typified by north-northeast trending mountain ranges separated
	by broad flat alluvium filled valleys. Gold and silver mineralization is known to occur in many parts of this Province.




	 




	In
	the vicinity of the GSR property there are numerous historical small mine workings in the surrounding mountain ranges, an active
	exploration project at Bell Mt. 8 miles to the northwest and several past producing large gold mines, such as Paradise Peak 25
	miles to the southeast and Rawhide 25 miles to the west.




	 




	The
	near-surface rocks in the area of the GSR property are a series of sub-outcropping Mesozoic Age metasedimentary rocks overlain
	by Tertiary Age rhyolitic lavas and volcanoclastics.




	 




	No
	exploration has been carried out on the property by GSR and it has not been examined by a GSR contracted professional geologist
	or by GSR’s officers or directors.




	 




	Due
	to current subdued market conditions in the junior natural resource markets the Company has no plans for an exploration program
	until it has the ability to raise sufficient funds to engage in an exploration program. Such a program would likely initially
	entail prospecting, geological mapping and rock-chip sampling. Quality Assurance and Quality Controls for sampling collection
	protocols will be developed with the exploration program as funding allows. There would be no permitting or bonding requirements
	for this preliminary phase of exploration. Permits and bonding would be required if and when exploration advanced to a drilling
	or trenching phase since those activities cause surface disturbance.




	 




	The
	property is currently without any known reserves and any program to be proposed in the future would be exploratory in nature.

History


Incorporated in May 1992, Golden Star is an established gold mining company with operations in Ghana. For more information on our key milestones, please explore our timeline below.
Expand All   >

2016

Wassa
The first stope is blasted at Wassa Underground in July 2016 in the F Shoot zone of the deposit, with commercial production achieved on January 1, 2017. Development continues and drilling results continue to confirm wide zones of high grade gold mineralization in the B Shoot.
Prestea
Underground infrastructure refurbishment is largely completed by the end of 2016 and Prestea Underground is expected to be in commercial production by mid-2017. Alimak stoping is selected as the mining method for Prestea Underground due to its safety and efficiency benefits.
The Prestea Open Pits deliver substantially higher gold production in 2016 than expected. The mining lease for the Mampon deposit, which will be mined in 2017, is received. Mampon’s high grade ore will be blended with ore from Prestea Open Pits to extend the mine life of the Prestea Open Pits into the second half of 2017.
        



2015

Wassa
The Feasibility Study is completed for Wassa Underground. Funding is secured from Royal Gold for the development of Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground. Construction of the twin declines at Wassa Underground begins in mid-2015.
Prestea
A Feasibility Study for Prestea Underground is completed in late 2015. Mining begins at Prestea Open Pits and Prestea Underground is expected to be in production in mid-2017.
Bogoso
The high cost refractory operations at Bogoso are terminated in the third quarter of 2015.



2014

Wassa
The Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) is released for Wassa Underground. Development is estimated to require initial capital expenditure of $41 million and reduce life of mine cash operating costs to below $800 from the start of 2015. Open pit mining at Father Brown is sidelined due to higher mining costs. 
Prestea
A PEA is released on the development of Prestea Underground. 



2013

Wassa
Alterations to the Wassa plant are completed to enable processing of deeper, harder ores. Ongoing drilling below the Wassa pits continues to extend underground mineralization 400m to the south. Work commences to transform the Wassa pits into a single large pit – the Wassa Main Pit.
Bogoso
Tailings retreatment commenced.



2012

Wassa 
Drilling commences of the deeper zones below the Wassa pits. Results are promising, indicating the potential for an underground mining operation.
Bogoso 
The non-refractory plant is converted successfully to a tailings reprocessing facility. The back-filling of the Plant North pit is completed.



2011

Wassa
Mining at Adiokrom is completed and open pit mining at Father Brown commences. 
Bogoso
The Biox® tanks at the Refractory Processing Plant are upgraded.



2010

Bogoso
Mining of the Plant North pit ceases. Mining continues at the Chujah and Buesichem pits.



2009

Wassa
Mining of the Benso deposit is completed, while mining at the Adiokrom deposit commences. Deep drilling suggests potential underground mining is possible at both the Adiokrom and Father Brown deposits.
Bogoso
Construction of a back-up 20MW diesel-fired power station at Bogoso is completed. 



2008

Wassa
Mining of the Benso deposit commences, feeding higher grade ore to the Wassa plant.
Bogoso
Bogoso mine operations are optimized but the processing plants are impacted by intermittent grid power supply. 



2007

Wassa
Construction of an 80km dedicated haul road from the Hwini-Butre deposits to the Wassa mine is completed.
Bogoso
The Bogoso Refractory Processing Plant is commissioned in July.



2006

Wassa
Wassa is connected to grid power, reducing power costs dramatically. St. Jude Resources is acquired, which owned the Hwini-Butre and Benso concessions. Resource drilling on these concessions commences.
Bogoso
Processing of the non-refractory ores in the Bogoso plant continues but deeper, more sulphidic ore demonstrates the need for the refractory processing plant, which continues to be constructed. The Prestea Underground Mineral Resources total nearly 2 million ounces.



2005

Wassa
The carbon in leach (CIL) plant is commissioned.
Bogoso
Construction of the Bogoso Refractory Processing Plant, designed to use Biox® technology, commences. At Prestea, the West Reef area drilling returns encouraging results leading to further expenditures on drilling and underground refurbishment.



2004

Wassa
A Feasibility Study is completed on converting Wassa from a heap leach operation to a conventional CIL plant and construction begins.
Bogoso
The capacity of the refractory processing plant capacity is doubled. The West Reef area is identified as prospective and underground drilling commences.



2003

Wassa
Golden Star acquires the Wassa Gold Mine from Standard Bank for $16 million as a result of their foreclosure of Glencar Mining assets.
Bogoso
A Feasibility Study on the refractory Mineral Reserves commences, with use of Biox® technology contemplated. The Plant North pit on the Prestea concession is commissioned.



2002

Bogoso
The Prestea concession is acquired from the joint venture between the Government of Ghana and the Ghana National Mineworkers Union. Prestea had been in intermittent production since the 1890s, producing over 9 million ounces of gold from underground mining techniques. Work to repair the pumping system and dewater the mine, refurbish both shafts, and repair electrical and ventilation systems commences.



1999

Bogoso
Golden Star acquires the Bogoso concessions and the associated infrastructure. Mining of oxide ores continues while investing heavily in exploration drilling. This exploration is successful, ultimately increasing the non-refractory Mineral Reserves tenfold and finding millions of ounces of refractory ore.

Environment




Golden Star is committed to meeting or surpassing regulatory requirements in all of its exploration, development, mining, and closure activities while safeguarding the local environment for our stakeholder communities and for future generations. To access our environment policy, please click here.
At Golden Star, operations are guided with a precautionary approach to environmental management. The aim is to minimize our environmental footprint, while promoting greater overall environmental responsibility both within Golden Star and our stakeholder communities. We approach these environmental responsibilities proactively, and with due care. Over the past few years, Golden Star has undertaken the following initiatives:

Water
Water management is fundamental to our operations and we remain committed towards maintaining local water quality and the sustainability of current and future water allocation. This is achieved by: 

Reducing clean water in flows into the plant; 
Maximizing the reuse of water in our processing plants; 
Providing secondary containment for all our reaction vessels so protecting the receiving environment; and 
Establishing engineered, purpose-built wetland treatment marshes for biological treatment and polishing of waters before they are discharged to the downstream receiving environment. 

Rehabilitation and next land use planning
Golden Star is committed to sustainable land use and mine-site rehabilitation as an integral part of all the phases of project development and execution. Initiatives include: 

Progressive rehabilitation of pits and waste dumps; 
Where pit sequencing allows, backfilling pits so allowing a next land use agreed to by our stakeholders;
Introduction of our award-winning oil palm project as an economic livelihood project for artisanal miners and other community members.

Who We Are



Golden Star is an established West African gold mining company. We have two producing mines in Ghana and we are transforming into a high grade, low cost, non-refractory gold producer.
Golden Star is listed on the NYSE MKT stock exchange (ticker: GSS), the Toronto Stock Exchange (ticker: GSC) and the Ghana Stock Exchange (ticker: GSR).
The investment case for Golden Star is as follows:
Expand All   >

Established, mid-tier gold producer


Golden Star has a 17 year history of producing gold in Ghana. We have two producing mines, Wassa and Prestea, in the south-west of the country, and in 2017 we are on track to produce 255-280,000 ounces of gold at a cash operating cost of $780-860/oz. Ghana is a stable jurisdiction with a century-long history of mining and good existing infrastructure



Production is expanding and costs are reducing


Between 2016 and 2019 Golden Star’s production is expected to increase by 60% and its cash operating costs are expected to decrease by 29%. The key drivers for these changes are Golden Star’s two high grade development projects, Wassa Underground and Prestea Underground. Wassa Underground achieved commercial production in January 2017 and Prestea Underground is expected to follow it into commercial production in Q3 2017.



Strong exploration upside potential


Golden Star has significant potential to expand its Mineral Reserves and the lives of its operations through converting its Mineral Resources to Reserves. There is also substantial potential to expand our Mineral Reserves outside of the current resource area. Golden Star’s mineral concession areas cover approximately 85km of the 250km Ashanti Gold Belt. We have the largest land package of any company operating in Ghana, including the major gold producers.



Experienced management team


Golden Star has an experienced management team with a track record of discovery and project delivery. Sam Coetzer, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a mining engineer by background with over 26 years’ experience. He previously worked for Kinross, Xstrata Nickel, Xstrata Coal and Placer Dome at open pit and underground mining operations.



Undervalued compared to peer group


Golden Star has significant potential for share price growth as despite our strong performance since the start of 2016, we remain undervalued compared to our peer group on a number of metrics. We intend to continue to increase our share price by developing a reputation for delivery.
