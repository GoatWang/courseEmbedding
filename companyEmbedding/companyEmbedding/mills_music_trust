A true oddball: Mills Music Trust





My goal when starting this blog was to find and profile companies far off the radar for most investors.  I usually profile small caps, net-net's, and a lot of foreign companies.  For most investors bombarded by the mainstream financial media the things I write about are really offbeat.  For investors who invest in deep value global small caps a lot of names I mention seem to be common.  After all there are only so many stocks globally and there are a lot of people picking through them.

From time to time I uncover a truly oddball stock, something that is both unknown and a different creature all together, Mills Music definitely qualifies.  I find these stocks interesting because due to complexity or details most investors pass over them.  Mills Music Trust qualifies as something hard to grasp, yet has the markings of a good opportunity.

Imagine a stock without any tangible assets, or a book value.  If it was liquidated it would be worth something yet there is no balance sheet.  The income statement is seven lines long, yes just seven lines.  This is the quick description of Mills Music Trust.

What is it?  Mills Music is a cash collection and distribution machine.  Where's the cash come from you ask?  It comes from EMI the music company.  Mills Music owns the rights to some "oldies" songs, nothing more, nothing less.  Every time a royalty event happens with a song Mills has the rights to EMI makes a note and eventually sends over a royalty.  Four times a year Mills Music pays out the cash received from EMI minus some bookkeeping fees to unit holders.

The business is simple enough, cash in, cash out.  The simplicity is fascinating, here is last year's income statement:


A random thought, I love the fact that they will keep less than $100 undistributed at the end of each year. 

The first question to ask is why would anyone want to buy Mills Music Trust?  The answer is blindingly obvious, for the yield of course.  They have paid out $2.62 per share so far this year, and have paid out between $3 and $4.50 over the past five years.  The stock yields close to 9% currently.  Of course no one knows how much they'll pay out in the future because no one knows how many times The Little Drummer Boy will be played on the radio this Christmas either.

Here is the historic dividend history:


There really isn't much else to say about Mills Music Trust.  In short old songs are played on the radio or downloaded in iTunes and Amazon, the cash is sent to EMI, who sends it to Mills Music, who sends it to you.  Mills has rights to over 25,000 songs, but only about 1,500 songs actually generate royalties.  The next copyright of a top 50-income generating song expires in 2018.  Amazingly 66% of the royalties comes from the top 50 songs.  The rights Mills Music owns seem to be as obscure as the stocks I write about.

Oldies are probably pretty stable at this point meaning the dividend is probably pretty stable until some of the songs start rolling off the copyright rights.  For an almost 9% dividend this seems like a pretty safe bet.

danMarch 10, 2012 at 8:37 AMIf you look carefully you'll see that Paul McCartney is the largest shareholder...ReplyDeleteRepliesNate TobikMarch 10, 2012 at 10:06 AMI noticed that probably five minutes after I posted this.  It's pretty safe to say that Paul McCartney knows the value of rights, so if he owns a lot he must see value in this.DeleteReplyAnonymousMarch 10, 2012 at 8:55 AMThanks for the write-up Nate.  Wow, only 277K units outstanding and an $11mil market cap, teeny tiny.  So, if I read this correctly unless the trust acquires new assets (or copyright laws), its copyrights will expire and revenues will gradually decrease over time?Anyway, sounds like a great business model.  Easier than managing a building and collecting rent.ReplyDeleteRepliesNate TobikMarch 10, 2012 at 2:21 PMYou're right, the trust will slowly distribute less and less cash eventually ending at zero.  The next expiration is in 2018 and they slowly roll off after that.  I need to emphasize slowly, copyrights last 95 years.  So for a song that came out in 1940 you're looking at 2035 before the copyright is done.  The ones rolling off now came out in 1917...quite a while ago.DeleteReplyThomas BrazielMarch 11, 2012 at 1:47 AMHey Nate... cool idea... thanks for the post.  I don't mean to seem thick but how can you tell that Paul McCarney is the largest shareholder?  Thanks, ThomasReplyDeleteRepliesNate TobikMarch 13, 2012 at 12:04 AMI saw it when I googled the company.  If you Google "Mills Music Trust Paul McCartney" you'll find a few articles mentioning that he's a major shareholder.  Apparently there was a dispute back in 2001 over how Mills Music calculated his dividend.NateDeleteginbumApril 21, 2012 at 8:40 AMI have owned MMTRS since 1974.  I have the prospectus from the 1964 rights offering by Utilities and Industries Corp. The Trust's expiration date is when the last descendant of John F. Kennedy dies.DeleteAnonymousOctober 8, 2013 at 5:44 PMginbum, would you mind posting a copy of the prospectus?DeleteReplyWexboyMarch 13, 2012 at 11:47 AMAwesome post, Nate - thanks! I'm sure McCartney hates that its called the Mills music trust...!ReplyDeleteKonradMarch 13, 2012 at 5:35 PMThe fact that they have an audit firm looking over the EMI calculations is also a positive in my view. If EMI underpaid, there is a potential windfall gain through a settlement, if nothing comes out, $17.5k won't hurt much. The audit only started in Nov 11, so it will likely be a while before we hear results.ReplyDeleteLorenzoMarch 14, 2012 at 7:26 AMAren't the rights of the songs enough of an asset to make a balance sheet?ReplyDeleteRepliesNate TobikMarch 14, 2012 at 8:08 AMLorenzo,Yes you could make a balance sheet but it really isn't necessary.  They pay out all of their cash except for $67 or so.  There are no liabilities outside of dividend payments to trust holders.With the music rights I think it would be hard to value them.  I'm sure they have some value, but how do you carry that on the balance sheet.  Most of the rights don't produce income so I'm not sure if they even have any value.  The best way to figure out an asset value is probably just a dividend discount on the present value of the cash flows.NateDeleteReplyjarmMarch 14, 2012 at 8:52 AMIf my data is correct, largest shareholders are:MPL Communication (McCartney) - 79.6k sharesFirst Eagle Investment Management - 34.9k sharesFirst Manhattan Company - 8.7k sharesReplyDeleteyomahaMarch 14, 2012 at 9:48 PMWhere can you see a list of songs that they own?  Owning certain songs reminds me of something like Coke where you own an intangible that is engrained in people's minds so much so that it is nearly possible to untrench, ie., Little Drummer Boy.How often (if ever) do they acquire rights to new music?ReplyDeleteRepliesNate TobikMarch 14, 2012 at 10:15 PMI think the best way to find this out would be to call the trustee.  I found on Wikipedia a listing of some of the top songs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterson,_Berlin_%26_Snyder,_Inc.I don't believe they ever buy new rights, this is just a trust holding existing rights that eventually maybe in 50 or 60 years will just run out.DeletegrossmismanagerApril 12, 2012 at 2:14 PMI've done some research into this, for what's it's worth.  See my post from earlier today but don't bet the ranch on my conclusions.DeleteJarrett RossMay 19, 2014 at 4:52 PMIt's quite simple. All you have to do is use the ACE search through ASCAP; https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx. Search for Mills Music under Publishers and you will see about 35 results with about 6 or 7 being owned by the Mills Music Trust. All the EMI Mills Music listings and I believe a few others. If you click on these you will see all the songs they own. DeleteReplyFilipeMarch 15, 2012 at 8:21 AMHi Nate,My take is one should value this with a dividend discount model. It's like a perpetuity, the dividend has been in the same range ($3-$5) since at least 1991.But my question to you is, what would be the appropriate discount rate for Mills? In your opinion would an eventual increase in interest rates cause the price of the stock to move down?Great find!ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 17, 2012 at 5:44 PMI have owned this "stock" for 5-7 years depending on which share you check.  I bought most at approx. 32 dollars, but so I could own a nice round number bought about 50 of them at 37.   Now I have always just counted the payments as dividends and that's it. I never received any schedule k's or other papers to make things more difficult.  Now, I am  poor so the IRS doesn't care much, but people on the Yahoo discussion group seem to get all worried about the tax treatment.  I have heard enough to be confused. Even that I need pay NO taxes until I have received my purchast price. HA HA  Can I just continue as before,  the schedule K one the web is unreadable and what is readable is confusing as hell.ReplyDeleteAnonymousMarch 21, 2012 at 3:42 PM"top 50-income generating song expires in 2018.  Amazingly 66% of the royalties comes from the top 50 songs"If I am understanding correctly, their revenues decline about 66% following the loss of copyrights on their music rights "inventory"?  If that is the case, each dividend is more like a return OF capital, not ON capital, and the stock at $40 is very unattractive. In fact, running numbers based on what I think are reasonable assumptions, and taking into account that overhead is 45 cents/share, I would not buy this until it was at least $15 for a 20% return (because I don't know the expiration of the remaining 33% of revenues, I need a high return hurdle).  This is a classic situation of a stock trading off of dividend yield until one day the dividend is cut and the stock plummets - have seen it happen time and time again.ReplyDeleteRepliesTodd EricksonMarch 26, 2012 at 9:45 AMThe yield overstates what you'll actually earn.  The actual annual return for holding shares will be less because the distributions will fall over time, eventually reaching zero. Investors would be better served calculating an internal rate of return (IRR) to gauge realistic investment returns. The IRR is probably 6.7% at current prices ($41).  This scenario assumes distributions are stable until 2018, begin falling in 2018 as copyrights begin to expire, and fade steadily until 2055 when they cease as all copyrights will have expired.To get an IRR of 10%, you could only pay $31/unit.  To receive an IRR of 15%, you could only pay $21/unit.(if some of the top 10 hits expire closer to 2018, then the actual IRR would be lower than indicated.  Also, if administrative costs rise faster than royalties over time, then the actual IRR would be lower than suggested above.)DeleteReplyAnonymousMarch 29, 2012 at 2:51 PMI am of the same view as the last two replies. Under no circumstance would I pay more than $20 for this. You are not going to get your principal back and I would bet that distributions will diminish materially faster than a straight line assumption. The reason is that the older these songs get, the less they will be played. Sentimentality for songs can stretch over a generation or two (e.g., an adult today remembers when she was 7 years old that her grandmother always played a certain song, so she still likes it), but they are not eternal. Thus, not only will the number of songs earning royalties decline over time, the royalties per song will also decline. My guess is the only thing that kept the royalties relatively steady so far is that population growth and the internet have offset the decline in interest of the songs. But the loss of interest will eventually win out, and I don't think it will take 50 more years for most of this material.ReplyDeletegrossmismanagerApril 12, 2012 at 12:24 PMI bought some MMTRS a while back for a Roth IRA and have since communicated several times with the trustee (HSBC in NYC) in an effort to satisfy my curiosity about the list of copyrights held.  So far they haven't released the original registration filing (from 1964), but they say they're talking with EMI in England to see about doing that.  The SEC doesn't even have a copy of the filing because it's so old their retention standards kicked in.Meanwhile, the most recent 10k DOES list what were apparently the 50 most lucrative titles over the past fiscal year.  They included (among others): Little Drummer Boy, Sleigh Ride, Star Dust, It Don't Mean A Thing, Mood Indigo, I've Got the World On A String, Ain't Misbehavin', Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, Red Roses For A Blue Lady, Stars Fell On Alabama, Stormy Weather, St. James Infirmary, Shakin' All Over and You've Got Your Troubles.Last night I discovered an online database (University of Wisconsin's, I believe) listing sheet music published by Mills Music over the years, and I think it's a reasonably safe bet that many of the titles are held by the trust.  Less certain is when the various copyrights run out.  I made myself a list of the titles that intrigued me and there isn't space to share them all here, so this is a partial summary from oldest (1923) to newest (1964) - and please note I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT SOME OR ALL OF THESE.  Copyright laws have changed frequently over the years both in the US and overseas, records seem murky at best and it hasn't been unusual for various people to copyright the same (or a slightly different) tune at different times:Who's Sorry Now, Bye Bye Blackbird, Someone to Watch Over Me, Me and My Shadow, Button Up Your Overcoat, Happy Days Are Here Again, Puttin' On the Ritz, Singin' In the Rain, Tiptoe Through the Tulips, Dream A Little Dream of Me, Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, Anything Goes, I Get A Kick Out of You, I Only Have Eyes For You, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, The Way You Look Tonight, Anial Crackers In My Soup, O Holy Night, I've Got You Under My Skin, A Tisket A Tasket, Hooray For Hollywood, Moonlight Serenade, South of the Border, Fools Rush In, Pennsylvania 6-5000, Woody Woodpecker, You Are My Sunshine, Deep In the Heart of Texas, That Old Black Magic,  White Christmas, Oklahoma, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, Sentimental Journey, Sixteen Tons, There's No Business Like Show Business, Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, Everybody Loves Somebody, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening, Glow-Worm, That Doggie In the Window, Your Cheatin' Heart, That's Amore, You'll Never Walk Alone, Earth Angel, I Left My Heart In San Francisco, Love and Marriage, Whatever Lola Wants, Blue Suede Shoes, Graduation Day, Heartbreak Hotel, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, I Feel Pretty, Maria, Donna, Purple People Eater, Stagger Lee, My Favorite Things, Put On A Happy Face, Try A Little Tenderness, Can't Help Falling In Love, Moon River, Breaking Up Is Hard to Do, Call Me Irresponsible, Dominique, Do You Hear What I Hear, On Broadway, Girl From Ipanema, Hello Dolly, It's A Small World, King of the Road, That's Life.There are a lot of holiday songs (esp Christmas carols) and show tunes among the titles associated with Mills Music.  As for the McCartney (MPL) ownership, it's worth noting that Mills titles also include Till There Was You, Besame Mucho, Don't Get Around Much Anymore, Ain't She Sweet, Ac-Cent-Tschu-Art the Positive and Bye Bye Blackbird – all of which McCartney has recorded at one point or another in his career.There are also a handful of interesting post-1964 titles (things like Strangers In the Night, White Rabbit, Mr. Bojangles, Sunshine of Your Love, You've Got a Friend, Stairway to Heaven and My Sharona, among others) but I believe they are all considered part of "New Mills Music" and therefore their income is irrelevant to MMTRS.ReplyDeleteJarrett RossMay 19, 2014 at 5:23 PMI think everyone here would understand this company much better if they understood the true history of Mills Music Publishing and if they understood music publishing in general. First off, when it comes to music rights it does not become public domain until 70 years after the death of the composer/songwriter. You can also find the whole catalogue owned by Mills Music by using the ACE search through the ASCAP website; https://www.ascap.com/Home/ace-title-search/index.aspx. As for understanding where all these songs came from, here is the history of the company. It was originally founded as Jack Mills Music in 1919 by Jacks Mills. Jack hired his cousin Jack Ecoff (my great-grandfather) to be the general sales manager. Jack Mills' brother Irving Mills acted as VP and they eventually changed the name to Mills Music in 1928. Working out of 1619 Broadway Blvd in New York they worked with many different songwriters and composers of the 20s, acting as one of the few publishing companies who would sign black writers. They had Alberta Hunter, James P Johnson, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and many other famous acts of the period signed to their catalogue. They owned the rights to many famous tunes, many of which have already been listed in these comments. If you research Jack Mills or Irving Mills you will find a lot about their work and about the company. I highly suggest looking through old Billboard magazines which mention Jack Mills, Irving Mills, and Jack Ecoff quite often as they were figure heads of the music industry from the 30s-60s. You can find a lot of this just through google search and google books search. If you want to understand where all the money comes from for MMTRS then read up about the different licenses associated with Music Publishing Rights. These include mechanical licenses, synchronization licenses, print licenses, and performance royalties. Also understand that each song is not owned outright by Mills Music because every song has two rights associated with it; publishing rights and songwriter rights. The most Mills Music can own of each song in it's catalogue is 50%, the other 50% is owner by the songwriter(s)/composer(s). Music Publishing is the most complicated part of the music industry and something many have a hard time understanding how it works.  ReplyDeleteAdd commentLoad more...

					Full Description



Mills Music Trust (the Trust) is formed for the purpose of acquiring from Mills Music, Inc. (Old Mills), the right to receive payment of a deferred contingent purchase price obligation (the Contingent Portion) payable to Old Mills. The obligation to pay the Contingent Portion arose as the result of the sale by Old Mills of its music and lyric copyright catalogue (the Catalogue). The Contingent Portion amounts are payable by EMI Mills Music Inc. (EMI), the owner of the copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. The Trust receives quarterly payments of the Contingent Portion from EMI and distributes the amounts it receives to the registered owners of Trust Certificates (the Unit Holders) representing interests in the Trust (the Trust Units), after payment of, or withholdings in connection with, expenses and liabilities of the Trust. EMI is the owner of the copyrighted materials contained in the Catalogue. Payments of the Contingent Portion to the Trust are based on royalty income, which the Catalogue generates.The Catalogue consists of over 25,000 music titles (the Copyrighted Songs), of which approximately 1,600 produced royalty income. EMI provides the Trust with a listing (the 2015 Listing) of songs in the Catalogue. Based on the 2015 Listing, the Trust derives its receipts principally from copyrights in the Unites States. Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC (Sony/ATV) is the administrator and manager of EMI and the Catalogue.

Mills Music Trust - Dividend Yielder For The Next 11 Years? - Mills Music Trust (OTCMKTS:MMTRS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Mills Music Trust - Dividend Yielder For The Next 11 Years?Feb.24.17 | About: Mills Music (MMTRS) Jan Svenda Contrarian, event-driven, Deep Value, long/short equitySummaryThis trust based on musical royalties (i.e. whenever a song is played or bought the trust gets paid) is offering a peculiar investment opportunity.
        I believe that given the historical performance of the songs distributions might continue in relatively stable manner. Investors could earn their initial investment in roughly 11 years, yielding 9% p.a.
        Moreover, the trust is in dispute with EMI, company that receives gross revenue from the songs which could yield MMTRS extra royalties. This could also lower expenses further increasing distributions.
        That being said there are many fundamental risks that are hard to anticipate therefore the longer the outlook of the investor the better.
        Note: Subscribers of The Microcap Review had an early look at this article. Company Introduction Mills Music Trust (OTCPK:MMTRS) was set up in 1964 in order to retain the ability to receive a portion of the musical royalties tied to the songs that the parent company, which was being sold, owned. These royalties are received by MMTRS until the song enters the public domain which usually occurs after 95 years (but can be prolonged). The current expiration dates of the songs vary with some expiring as late as 2076. EMI Mills Music Inc. is in charge of collecting, managing and distributing the royalties to the trust. The catalogue of 25,000 songs that MMTRS 'owns' is not public, but since 2011 EMI sends the trust a list of Top 50 grossing songs for each year. These usually account for more than 85% of the royalties and only roughly 1,600 songs are actively receiving any royalties. Thus there is a considerable concentration of the distributions in only a few songs. The trust does not own anything else, it does not produce a balance sheet or a cash flow statement, just a simple income statement with the distributions and administrative expenses. There are three main owners of the trust units. 26.8% is owned by MPL Communications, Ltd, which is a holding company of Paul McCartney (yes the one from Beatles) that owns the units since at least 1997. The second biggest owner is First Eagle Investment Management, an asset manager which owns 11.4%. The last major owner is Michael E. Reiss a partner at a value fund Buttonwood Tree Value Partners who owns 8.9%.
 Mr. Reiss is also a trustee who oversees MMTRS since late 2013 alongside Mr. Lee Eastman who was also named a trustee in the same year and is connected to MPL Communications. MMTRS distributes the royalties on a quarterly basis and regularly files with the SEC. Investment Thesis The key here is to estimate what will be the future distributions and whether at the current price the investment would make sense as theoretically the trust value should decrease over time as the songs begin to enter the public domain. I believe that as of now there is an opportunity to initiate a position due to the following points;  At a conservative estimate, the initial investment at the current prices could be earned in around 11 years yielding roughly 9% per annum. This is based on historical payouts and trends of the distribution composition. While one might think that the trust should earn less and less, especially on songs that have been around since the 1920's the trend is not clear and has not been materializing as one would expect. This argument is supported by the fact that in the last three years (since this data is available) five songs have accounted for more than 50% of the gross royalties received by EMI. Only two of these songs enter the public domain in the 2020's (the least grossing in 2027 and the second lowest grossing in 2023). The recent distributions of MMTRS were also smaller than usual due to increased administrative expenses. These are reasonable as the trust has an ongoing dispute with EMI over the distributions. The company believes that EMI underpays the trust and currently owes MMTRS roughly $0.44 million. I believe that the trust might be able to win or at least settle due to past dealings with EMI as they already admitted to miscalculating distributions in the past. Once this is cleared out not only that the trust could gain extra royalties but it could also go back to lower expenses and thus support distributions further.  On the other hand, the following risks should be accounted for by the investors;
  The share price matters and while the next eleven years could be relatively stable and earn investors their initial investment the yield could be significantly dampened should the stock start to sell off due to possibly decreasing revenues. While it seems that this is not likely to occur due to the composition of the song portfolio and the surprising resilience of the distribution stream (given Internet etc.), there are many fundamental risks that are hard to predict and that could occur in the future.  To conclude I believe that at the current prices investors are able to initiate a position through which they could regain their initial capital in a reasonable amount of time at an interesting yield, although I believe investors that are willing to take a longer outlook (15 years+) might be able to benefit from even better yield and possibly smaller share price risk. Past distributions and song performance As mentioned the revenue stream has been surprisingly robust given what one could expect from songs originated in the years 1922 to 1958. 

 Note: EMI incurs expenses related to the royalties (such as renewal of the copyrights etc.). The breakdown is first available for 2012. These expenses are the predominant reason for 2013's low amount of royalties received (although the gross royalties were also slightly lower). While it might seem that we are entering a period of lower royalties received going forward one can see that the songs are still performing well and that the overall volatility of the royalties is low (the chart's range is tight prior to 2013 and for example royalties from 1992 are lower than in late 2000's). The fairly low volatility could be explained by the concentration of the royalties as Top 50 songs routinely account for more than 85%.
 

 Note: 2012 and 2011 are quoted as royalties received from EMI, the rest is gross royalties earned by EMI. This data was made available for the first time in 2013. This then means that one needs to understand the volatility in these top songs. I chose to dissect the Top 10 for each year as it still represents the majority of the royalty base. 

 Note: I took the occurrence of each song in the past five years, but the royalties only in the past three years as in 2012 and 2011 the company only reported royalties per song as received by MMTRS, not gross royalties that EMI recorded. As you can see there is some volatility in the songs. One example could be Caravan which likely earned significantly more than in past due to the film 'Whiplash' in 2015, but given the fact that such a significant portion comes from only few songs I believe it is unlikely that the royalties stream should radically change over the next few years. Moreover, the second important point is that the expiration of the top grossing songs is in the distant future and the company should only lose 20% to 30% of revenue in the next 11 years as I specify in the future distributions section. While the past performance of MMTRS is interesting and shows that the royalty stream is likely to be intact going forward, one has to remember that this is a sample from the past 5 years as there is limited data available and therefore the prior periods might have looked differently.
 Disputes with EMI Not only that the fundamental outlook is not necessarily bleak given the fact that the songs were able to continuously gather enough royalties at a relatively low volatility, but the trust could also see increased distributions coming from EMI given an ongoing battle regarding the way EMI computes the trust's share of gross royalties. EMI receives gross royalties from which they take away expenses such as copyright renewal and royalty related expenses. Then EMI takes away a portion of the share for itself and the rest goes to MMTRS as can be seen below. 

 In the original agreement from 1964 EMI agrees to compute the trust's share in the following way. Until 2010 MMTRS's portion was computed as the excess of the gross royalties collected by EMI less royalty related expenses (payments to authors etc.) and by greater of the following;  25% of gross royalties or $87,500 or 30% of gross royalties, whichever was less  There was also a minimum distribution requirement which was set at $167,500 per quarter and if the quarterly distributions were larger than $0.5 million then the percentage of 25% was changed to up to 35%. In 2010 the agreement stipulates that the minimum distribution provision is discontinued and that the percentage of the deduction from the gross royalties is fixed at 25% (i.e. disregarding provision 2b). EMI continued to pay MMTRS's distributions under the old calculation method until the third quarter of 2010 when the trust notified the company of the new calculation method that should have been applied. EMI agreed to start to calculate the distributions under the new method. This lasted though only until Q3 of 2012 when EMI's legal counsel suddenly said that they dispute the interpretation of the 1964 agreement and reverted back to the old calculation.
 The reason why they might be incentivized to do so is that under that regime EMI stands to receive more money as the percentage of deduction ( originally 25% of gross royalties) can change if the gross royalty income is larger than $0.5 million as seen below. 

 Due to this MMTRS now believes that EMI underpaid the trust by the following amounts; 

 One can though potentially understand why EMI is trying to dispute this as the wording of the agreement is unclear regarding a specific paragraph about the 2010 change in the document. It is unclear whether paragraph 1,A,III holds for the paragraph 1,D to be specific. That being said I believe that past performance of EMI in managing the distribution process is dubious to say the least as seen in the following points;  In 2007 EMI tried to charge the trust extra royalty renewal expense and said that the minimum quarterly distributions of 2001 (connected to these expenses) were only advances, which MMTRS successfully argued against and in the end was not liable to pay anything. In 2011 the trust launched an audit into the past ten years of the distributions. This was aimed to see whether there were any material underpayments by EMI. The audit found multiple instances of this and the trust sued EMI for $2.6 million, in the end they settled out of court for $0.6 million in favour of MMTRS. In 2015 the trust found that even under the disputed calculation method (which EMI reinstated in 2012) the company underpaid them given the information EMI has provided. EMI acknowledged this error and repaid the amounts. 
 All this shows that EMI is likely not handling the trust fairly and there might be opportunity for recovering the disputed amount or even for another settlement as MMTRS launched another audit into the calculations of EMI in late 2015. Last but not least in 2013 the trust named two new independent trustees. This should ensure that the trust is getting its fair share from EMI and that the current dispute will be resolved. Especially because Mr. Reiss is a fund manager of Buttonwood Tree Value Partners, which is known for activist campaigns and various litigation. In the end though, as mentioned in the thesis not only that a resolution of the dispute might end up favorably for MMTRS, once the dispute is resolved the expenses of the trust will drastically come down and could settle at the historical levels of around $0.1 million per year. This comprises of audit fees, trustee compensation and the trust administration expense. Given that the current expenses can be as high as $0.6 million as seen below, it means that this could materially improve the future distributions. 

 Possible Future Distributions The following is inherently more of a forecast than I am naturally inclined to perform, but given the structure of the trust there is not much else one can do to try to estimate some sense of valuation. In order to prevent biases, I have included two scenarios that I feel are reasonable. The base case scenario involves the following assumptions;  Expenses are going to come down after a couple of years to the historical norm due to the fact that the trust will resolve the dispute with EMI. The forecast does not involve MMTRS winning the dispute and receiving the alleged underpayments or that EMI is going to start paying more due to the switch in the calculation method. The royalties of the songs are going to decrease over time based on the amount that might be lost as songs will enter the public domain. The summary of this can be seen below; 
 

 Note: The chart uses the expiration dates of the Top 50 songs and combines the royalties they brought. This is done for each year due to the variation in royalties per song. In the forecast, I used the 2015 implied lost royalties. I expect the distributions to come down from $0.8 million to $0.5 million in the respective period, or an approximate decrease of 37.5%. These then results in a forecast that implies a 9% yield per annum and 11 years until investors receive their initial investment. 

 The bear case scenario is based on the following assumptions;  The expenses are going to come down for some time, but I believe that it could be that MMTRS is going to need to audit EMI again or will face another dispute thus there might be increases in the expenses in the future. The royalties are going to decrease faster and slightly more than just by the expiration periods.  This would then prolong the pay-off date to 15 years and imply a yield of 6.6%. 

 I have not used any discount rate on the future distributions as I believe that they are already partially discounting the possible resilience of the revenue stream as seen in the historical performance. I have also not discounted the distributions for possible taxation which investors should consider in this case.
 Risks Share price risk As mentioned this is the crucial risk as it could dampen the yield of the investment. That being said even past the year 2028 the trust will be worth something as the main portion of songs will start to expire in 2040's therefore it is unlikely that the share price should plummet significantly by then. Moreover, the past share price action shows that the stock might not reflect the underlying value of trust well as the shares of MMTRS are now near 20-year lows as seen below. 

 Thus I believe the share price risk is lowered by this possible disconnection between the trading price and the underlying value. The share price will though for sure matter in around 25/30 years when the value of the trust might be clearer than now. Fundamental risks As mentioned, my thesis relies on the fact that the past performance of the songs is going to at least partially hold. This might not be the case if they fall out from popularity etc. I do not believe that this should occur in the next couple of years given the fact that maybe only significant shifts in generations could depress the performance of the songs, but this is, of course, a rough estimate. Copyright risk The last major risk that I see with MMTRS is that if copyright laws should change dramatically, this could affect the ability to earn the royalties. While there is an ongoing discussion in the US regarding the laws, any significant change is unlikely to occur in the next couple years as suggested here. The article also shows an important point. The discussion is political and there are two main interest parties involved. The licensors (creators, companies like EMI etc.) and the licensees (the entities that actually use the music). One could venture a guess that the licensors have much more leverage in this process and thus a radical change that would swing the situation against MMTRS is unlikely.
 Conclusion MMTRS offers a peculiar investment opportunity that is best taken with a long-term outlook. I believe that songs in the portfolio of the trust are not likely to disappear in the next 11 years in which the investors could earn their initial investment. This though also assumes that the share price is not going to be volatile and is not going to dampen the annual yield. This though might not be likely as there is a plethora of risks that could occur and therefore investors are better off holding the trust with the outlook of around 25 years which could ensure that any capital loss will be well compensated by the distributions. P.S. I recommend listening to (or even better yet buying or performing publicly) 'It don't mean a thing' from Duke Ellington, my absolute favorite from the Top 50 list of MMTRS.

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?
