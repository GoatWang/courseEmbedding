AngelList Talks Late-Stage Funding Syndicates, Global Expansion And A New Fund Ecosystem As The Angels Take Disrupt

A Run Through The Chinese Pavilion At TechCrunch Disrupt SF












AngelList is expanding globally and launching new vehicles for accredited investors to back what amounts to indexed AngelList syndicate funds for the top deals on the platform.
That’s the latest from AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and angel investor Gil Penchina from the stage of Disrupt SF 2014 as the angels who, along with CrunchFund investor (and TechCrunch founder) Michael Arrington, held the audience rapt.
The AngelList platform has grown increasingly robust, and through the syndicate vehicles can now invest in — and lead — Series A rounds, according to Navikant.
“Once my first fund got to $4 million there were people who weren’t able to get into every deal,” says Penchina. “So we launched the SAAS Syndicate… the Bitcoin syndicate, which is doing two deals; the IoT syndicate and a late stage syndicate, which is going to compete with late stage investors.”
Both Penchina and Ravikant see AngelList as a way to democratize the venture model from top to bottom, with the late-stage fund the latest shot from AngelList across the bow of traditional investors. At issue is the dilution that early-stage investors suffer in the high-priced later-stage rounds that have become the norm in Silicon Valley (and beyond) in recent years (thanks Andreessen Horowitz).



As the AngelList syndicates grow larger, they’re also professionalizing. Penchina has eight full-time staff working on his syndicate fund along with another 30 “volunteers.” So far, Penchina has deployed $3 million across his syndicates, but expects that number to soar to $10 million over the next 12 months.”
Ravikant envisions a system that allows an investor’s fund to grow as his experience and track record evolves. “It’s a smooth path up to a fund,” from angel investment, says Ravikant. “You can add backers as you go.”
AngelList is a way to add leverage to an investor’s checkbook. It’s additional firepower to compete against the more established and well-heeled investors in the venture community, and he argues it’s a better deal for the limited partners that invest in funds.
“Institutional LPs go into individual funds now,” he says.
Now that AngelList has managed to embed itself in the U.S. ecosystem, it’s casting its eye on markets around the world. The investment platform is in the process of obtaining regulatory clearance in the UK with plans to move into Canadian and Australian markets shortly thereafter.
The only problem with the AngelList model is the problem of overtaxing resources, both men said. “I’m in too many deals now,” Ravikant said.

What is a syndicate?



A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry.Here's an example: Sara, a notable angel investor, decides to lead a syndicate. The syndicate investors agree to invest $200K total in each of her future deals and pay her 15% carry.When Sara makes her next investment, she offers to invest $250K in the company. She personally invests $50K and offers the remaining $200K to her syndicate.If the investment is successful, the syndicate investors first receive their $200K, after which every dollar of the syndicate’s profit is split 80% to the syndicate investors, 15% to Sara and 5% to AngelList Advisors.  AngelList Advisors is a venture capital exempt reporting advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a subsidiary of AngelList.View syndicates »

What are the benefits of syndicates?



Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments.

How much do syndicates cost?



Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList Advisors.Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each deal—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList or AngelList Advisors does not profit from these fees.The lead and AngelList Advisors do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

What is the legal structure of a syndicate?



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically to invest in the company.  The fund is formed as a series LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors.The lead usually does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders.

What is carry?



Carry is a share of the profit of an investment that is paid to the managers of the investment. It is short for ‘carried interest’.In a VC fund, the limited partners of the fund pay carry to the general partners if the entire fund is profitable. This is called fund carry or net carry.In syndicates, investors pay carry to the lead for any profitable investment. This is called deal carry. Syndicates use deal carry so investors can opt out of any investment or stop investing anytime.Learn more about carry and the economics of
syndicates.

Do syndicates receive pro rata rights?



Syndicates receive pro rata rights if the lead negotiates them with the startup.  If a syndicate has pro rata rights, syndicate investors in the initial round may have the opportunity to invest their pro rata allocation in subsequent financings. Any remaining allocation may be offered to other investors or funds.  The pro rata may not be offered to syndicate investors if the lead does not participate, if it is unlikely that a reasonable amount of the pro rata will be filled, or for other reasons. Pro rata rights vary in strength and enforceability. Pro rata rights may be waivable by a majority of investors in the round or waived as a condition to a new financing round.

Who can see a syndicate deal?



The fundraising information of a syndicate deal is visible to accredited investors, while general information about the company is visible to the public.A syndicate lead can also restrict the fundraising information to investors who have been accepted into her syndicate. In this case, she may also restrict general information about the company to these same investors. Furthermore, the company may limit the information visible to investors.

Leads: What is minimum I have to invest in each deal?



The minimum investment for a lead who is investing her own money is generally 2.5% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors. The minimum investment for a lead who is investing out of a fund raised from limited partners is generally 20% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors.This minimum only applies to capital raised from individuals. Syndicates can raise an unlimited amount of capital from institutional investors such as platform funds.For example, if a lead puts $5K of her own money in a startup, she can raise an additional $195K from individual investors in her syndicate. She can also raise an unlimited amount of capital from a platform fund like CSC Upshot.The minimum investment may be reduced if a notable investor is making a significant investment in the round. It may also be reduced in pro ratas and other special situations. Investors in the syndicate will be notified if the minimum is reduced.Investors can also view the lead's investment amount in any deal and opt out of the deal, for any reason.Learn more

Leads: What happens if my allocation in a deal is smaller than my syndicate?



Each investor’s commitment will be reduced pro rata if your allocation is smaller than the total commitments from syndicate investors. Here's an example. Sara has a syndicate with 10 accepted investors. Each investor has committed $10K to the syndicate, for a total of $100K. Sara personally invests $20K in the deal and asks for an additional $100K for her syndicate. However, the startup is only able to allocate $50K to the syndicate. So each of her syndicate investors will invest $5K instead of the $10K they requested.If an investor‘s reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the investor will invest the minimum investment. In this case, if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will use her judgment to reduce investors’ amounts for that deal. The lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the company‘s markets or have large investment amounts.In some deals, a maximum may be placed on aggregate commitments by the platform funds.

Leads: Should I negotiate for pro rata rights?



Yes. Pro rata rights are important for AngelList and syndicate leads to invest additional capital in winning investments and generate larger returns. For syndicate leads this is especially valuable, since they can still earn carry in follow-on rounds. Leads should negotiate for pro rata rights on all deals.

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Leads: What is the lead's carry in a pro rata?



The lead's carry in a pro rata is the same as the initial round, as long as her investment is greater than or equal to either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller.The lead's carry in a pro rata will be reduced by 5% if her investment is less than either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller. AngelList Advisors, the fund's investment adviser, will receive this additional carry in addition to its usual 5% carry. This is due to  the added work and risk, and since AngelList Advisors is less able to look to the lead’s decision when advising the fund.In both cases, if the lead does not provide access to the pro rata and provide relevant information, she will not earn any carry and AngelList will receive a total of 10% carry.

Updated Nov 22, 2016








Leads: What should I name my syndicate?



Most leads use their full name for their syndicate because they expect investors to join the syndicate on the basis of their personal reputation.If you are investing on behalf of a firm or if you focus on a specific type of investment, you may wish to choose a different name for your syndicate.Investors should be able to clearly tell who is running the syndicate from the syndicate's name. The name should also not be generic or contain the word ‘syndicate’.“FG Angels” is a good name for a syndicate. “Angel” is not.“Hardware Investments by Vinod Khosla” is a good name for a syndicate. “The Hardware Syndicate” is not.

These deals may not be marketed publicly.You may market syndicated deals subject to section 506(c), commonly referred to as general solicitation.

Leads: How do I get my deal featured?

The AngelList-affiliated funds automatically consider every syndicate deal for investment.Featuring happens with the permission of the founder. The AngelList team may feature your deal to a relevant segment of the investor base only.

Leads: Limitations on syndicate investments in certain foreign companies (PFIC & CFC)




Investments in certain types of foreign companies ares subject to disadvantaged tax treatment and  ongoing compliance requirements. 
These rules are complicated, but if the investment is in a foreign holding company it may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)  and if the investment is in a foreign company that is majority owned by US taxpayers, it may be a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). 
As a result of the added tax and  compliance burdens, AngelList does not generally facilitate investment in either PFIC's or CFC's. When a syndicate makes an investment in a non-US company, the company will be asked to certify that it is neither a PFIC nor a CFC and agree to ongoing compliance requirements. 
 A lead should confirm the PFIC / CFC status with a foreign company early on to avoid wasted efforts. Any investment in a company that cannot certify to being a non-PFIC / CFC will either not be facilitated on AngelList or will require additional disclosures and approvals from AngelList.

Investors: What am I committing to when I back a syndicate?



You are committing to invest in the syndicate’s deals, on the same terms as the lead. You also agree to pay the lead and AngelList carry on those deals as well as the out-of-pocket costs of each deal. This is not a legally-binding agreement and you can opt out of any agreement or stop investing at any time. All of your existing investments remain intact if you stop investing.

Investors: I've indicated investment interest to a syndicate—what's next?

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Investors: What information rights do I have?



Syndicate investors receive less information than direct investors. An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to investors when they invest in a syndicate deal:Documents related to the fund’s formation such as its operating agreement, private placement memorandum and subscription agreement.General terms of the investment, if the company permits. Templates of deal documents signed by the fund may also be made available to investors. Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is high-level information similar to the information VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information about the company’s customers or financing. It will generally not include any figures.Any information investors need for taxes, such as K-1s, is distributed annually.

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Investors: When do I receive a return on my investment?



You will generally receive returns, if any, when the company is acquired or has an IPO. There may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares.When there is an exit opportunity, AngelList Advisors, in consultation with the lead, will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares. The decision to sell the shares is then made by Assure Fund Management. This will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid. If there are any profits, they are distributed to the syndicate investors.The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by  agreements with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations.

Investors: Do I have to invest every time one of my syndicates invests in a company?

Investors: Can I change my investment amount in a particular deal?



Investors can increase or decrease their investment in a particular deal. Any change is subject to approval by the lead. Investors can also opt out of any deal. The lead may also reduce an investor’s investment in a deal, particularly if it is oversubscribed.Investors that regularly lower their investment amounts or frequently opt out of deals may be removed by the lead.

Updated Sep 26, 2016








Investors: Why isn't there a higher minimum investment for leads?



Raising the minimum investment would cause some leads to stop syndicating their investments. Instead, they would start or join venture capital funds, which typically have no minimums.The
partners of a VC fund typically provide 1-5% of the fund's capital, but
also take out 15-25% in management fees. In
effect, they don't make a contribution to the fund. The minimum for leads investing their own money in a syndicate is 2.5%. And the minimum for leads investing out of a fund is 20%. Except in rare cases, leads receive no management fees from the syndicate. So, for the vast
majority of leads, syndicates are already more expensive than venture capital
funds. Raising the minimum would cause some leads to stop syndicating their
investments. They would instead invest through a venture capital fund.

Raising the minimum would also cause some leads who are new to investing to stop altogether, because it is already a significant portion of their net worth. This would lead to less diversity of investment opportunities from new leads.Investors who are unhappy with a lead's contribution can always opt out of an investment. They can also invest in AngelList Funds, which make investment decisions on behalf of investors, for no additional cost or carry.Learn more about the economics of syndicates.

Investors: Can non-U.S. investors invest in syndicates?



Under U.S. law, yes. You should also check the laws in your country.A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is helpful but not required.Investors inside and outside the U.S. should get tax advice when investing in startups.

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Investors: What are the tax consequences of investing in a syndicate?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members of a special-purpose fund formed to make the investment. That fund will purchase preferred shares, convertible debt or other instruments issued by the company.  Certain taxable events may result in income or losses flowing through the special-purpose fund to its investors.  Investors with taxable income or loss will receive K-1s.If the fund holds an equity interest in a portfolio company, there is a taxable event on exits or when the company is dissolved or files for bankruptcy. In rare instances, there may also be a taxable event if the fund receives a dividend or distribution.  If the fund purchases convertible debt, prior to conversion into equity, there may be a tax consequence for your portion of the interest on the debt or in connection with the cancellation of debt such as in a bankruptcy. Be sure to consult your tax advisor.

Updated Nov 15, 2016








Investors: What are the tax consequences for non-U.S. investors in syndicates?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members in a special-purpose vehicle, structured as a US series LLC. Each syndicate will typically send out IRS Forms K-1 to all its members, both foreign and domestic, in any year in which it has taxable income or deductible expenses. We understand from informal consultation with tax counsel that, generally, income and distributions from AngelList syndicated deals to non-US investors without substantial US business involvement are exempt from US tax and withholding requirements, provided that such investors have submitted the appropriate FATCA Related Forms. AngelList is not qualified to provide tax advice and the above should not be read as tax advice. There are many important exceptions to the generalization stated above, so please be sure to consult your tax advisor and relevant international tax treaties before making an investment.

Investors: What is a management fee?



A management fee is a quarterly or annual fee added onto a deal, meant to compensate the lead for their time and expenses. Leads may charge management fees for hiring employees, maintaining an office, paying salaries, etc. This is similar to how venture capital firms operate. However, in the case of an AngelList syndicate, because investors can opt in or out on each deal, all economics (including management fees) are calculated on a deal-by-deal basis.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: Which leads can charge management fees?



This is a new feature AngelList is exploring. To start, only leads who incur substantial costs running their AngelList syndicates will charge management fees. Right now this only applies to Gil Penchina. AngelList will determine if other leads qualify for management fees in the future.

Link to this
·
Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees work?



For each deal, the lifetime total management fee (ex. 3%) is collected upfront and drawn down by the lead over time (ex. 0.25% quarterly, for three years). If there's an exit before the entire management fee is drawn, undrawn capital is returned to investors. If there's a profitable exit, the lead must return the entire amount raised (including the management fee) before earning any carried interest.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees benefit investors?



Management fees allow leads to hire staff, maintain offices, and be competitive with venture capital firms that have fees at their disposal. Many of the world's top investors are VC General Partners. By introducing management fees, AngelList is better equipped to support this cohort of investors and attract them to share their deals online.Over time, many of the current syndicate leads will face financial pressure to start or join venture capital firms where they can earn fees to offset their costs. They may choose this instead of syndicating. Management fees help mitigate this financial pressure and retain leads on the AngelList platform.

·
Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do I know which deals charge management fees?



Management fees are displayed on the deal page alongside the setup costs that you pay on each deal. There is clear disclosure on deals with management fees. No additional work is required from you to participate in these deals. As always, you should review deal terms before participating and opt out on deals where you don’t like the terms. There are dozens of leads on AngelList with quality deal flow and no management fees.
