The analysts at First Wilshire dig deep when looking at investments. We seek to develop independent viewpoints instead of conforming to the majority view.
Our research is extensive and thorough. We continually search the Small Cap universe looking at companies for prospective investments. Once a candidate is identified, we undertake an investigation that typically includes not only an analysis of all financial figures, but also a visit to talk with management and personally interview management.
A company review may includes a tour of company facilities, interviews of its vendors, customers, lenders, and other stakeholders. This helps us get an insight into the company that one cannot get by just reviewing financial statements. Where possible, we corroborate the story, as detailed by management and the filings, with other research, such as testing the product, getting a disinterested third party’s opinion, or doing channel checks. Only a small number of Companies we investigate eventually pass this screening.
