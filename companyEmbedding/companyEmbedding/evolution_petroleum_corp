Evolution Petroleum About To Put More Money In Your Pocket (EPM)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 3/13/17, Evolution Petroleum Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.07, payable on 3/31/17. As a percentage of EPM's recent stock price of $8.20, this dividend works out to approximately 0.85%, so look for shares of Evolution Petroleum Corp to trade 0.85% lower — all else being equal — when EPM shares open for trading on 3/13/17.

Mar 9, 2017 10:57 AM EST









YieldBoost Evolution Petroleum Corp To 14.3% Using Options
Shareholders of Evolution Petroleum Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.2% annualized dividend yield can sell the October covered call at the $10 strike and collect the premium based on the 60 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 11.1% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 14.3% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $10 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but EPM shares would have to advance 15.6% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 22.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

EPM Crosses Above Average Analyst Target
In recent trading, shares of Evolution Petroleum Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $9.50, changing hands for $9.60/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

Ex-Div Reminder for Evolution Petroleum (EPM)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 12/13/16, Evolution Petroleum Corp will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.065, payable on 12/30/16. As a percentage of EPM's recent stock price of $9.44, this dividend works out to approximately 0.69%, so look for shares of Evolution Petroleum Corp to trade 0.69% lower — all else being equal — when EPM shares open for trading on 12/13/16.

Strategy To YieldBoost Evolution Petroleum Corp From 2.8% To 22.5% Using Options
Shareholders of Evolution Petroleum Corp looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the April 2017 covered call at the $10 strike and collect the premium based on the 70 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 19.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 22.5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $10 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but EPM shares would have to climb 5.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 13.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
