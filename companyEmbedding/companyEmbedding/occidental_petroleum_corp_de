Occidental Petroleum raises dividend by a penny 
Occidental Petroleum Corp.  said Thursday it will raise its quarterly dividend by a penny, or 1.3%, to 77 cents share. The oil and gas exploration company said the new dividend will be payable Oct. 16 to shareholders of record on Sept. 11. At current stock prices, the new annual dividend rate of $3.08 a share implies a dividend yield of 5.20%, compared with the SPDR Energy Select Sector's  yield of 2.59% and the S&P 500's  implied yield of 1.99%. "The dividend increase reflects our commitment to growing Occidental's dividend annually for our shareholders, and our confidence in the company's financial strength and future performance," said Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder. The stock, which inched up 0.1% in afternoon trade, has dropped 17% year to date, while the energy ETF has lost 14% and the S&P 500 has gained 9.3%.

Occidental Petroleum raises dividend by a penny 
Occidental Petroleum Corp.  said Thursday it will raise its quarterly dividend by a penny, or 1.3%, to 77 cents share. The oil and gas exploration company said the new dividend will be payable Oct. 16 to shareholders of record on Sept. 11. At current stock prices, the new annual dividend rate of $3.08 a share implies a dividend yield of 5.20%, compared with the SPDR Energy Select Sector's  yield of 2.59% and the S&P 500's  implied yield of 1.99%. "The dividend increase reflects our commitment to growing Occidental's dividend annually for our shareholders, and our confidence in the company's financial strength and future performance," said Occidental Chairman Eugene Batchelder. The stock, which inched up 0.1% in afternoon trade, has dropped 17% year to date, while the energy ETF has lost 14% and the S&P 500 has gained 9.3%.

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
Occidental was founded in 1920 in California. In 1956 Occidental Petroleum came to the attention of Armand Hammer.[10] At Hammer's first association with Occidental, the company was run by Dave Harris, Roy Roberts, and John Sullivan. In 1957, Dr. Armand Hammer was elected president and CEO. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in the Arbuckle area of the Sacramento basin at Lathrop.[11] Over the next 10 years, Occidental expanded internationally with operations in Libya, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. Occidental won exploration rights in Libya in 1965 and operated there until all activities were suspended in 1986 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya.
Occidental entered the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company in 1968, 26 years after the contamination at Love Canal. It added to its chemical industries portfolio in 1988 with the outright purchase for $2 billion of Cain Chemical.[12] On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster.[13]
Tenure of Ray R. Irani[edit]
In 1990, Dr. Ray R. Irani became Occidental Petroleum Corporation's Chairman and CEO. He held the additional title of President from 2005 to 2007. Occidental Petroleum's compensation policies came under scrutiny in 2007 after it was announced that CEO Ray Irani collected $460 million in stock shares and salary in 2006.[14] In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental shareholders, objected to the company's compensation policies for top executives.[15] President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani.[16] Since 1990, Occidental has gone from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas.[17] During Irani's tenure as CEO, Occidental's market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion from $5.4 billion by 2011.[18]
Appointment of Vicki Hollub[edit]
Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015,[2] was announced to be the new CEO effective as of the 2016 annual shareholders' meeting.[19] Hollub was appointed as president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, becoming the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.[20]
In 2015, Oxy was the 16th largest gas producer[8] and 3rd largest oil producer in Texas.[9] The company ranked #364 on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2015.[5] In 2016, it also ranked on the Fortune 500 list.[7]
Phibro Energy trading[edit]
In 2009, Oxy acquired Citigroup's controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million.[21] The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s.[22] In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.[23]
Research in Shale Oil[edit]
Starting in 1972, Occidental Oil Shale, Inc., a former subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, began research on a shale oil extraction process.[24]
The company conducted the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado.[24] The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51 m) area and had height of 400 feet (120 m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort.[25]
During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.[24][25] All together, six retorts have been burned at the site.[24]
Historical financial performance[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, Occidental was one of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies based on market capitalization, with a market capitalization of approximately $51 billion.[3]

Former areas of operation[edit]
California[edit]
Occidental formerly owned 100% of California Resources Corporation,[34] the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California.[35] Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation to Occidental shareholders in December 2014[34] and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016.[3]
Williston Basin, North Dakota[edit]
In 2010, Oxy acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion.[36] These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million.[37]
Argentina[edit]
In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109 GJ).[38]
Ecuador[edit]
Occidental formerly operated in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. The government of Ecuador seized the company's interest in 2006, and in 2016, the government agreed to pay USD$980 million in restitution to Occidental for the seizure, down from the original award of USD$1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).[39]
Brazil[edit]
In 2013, Oxychem sold its investment in Unipar Carbocloro for R$550 million.[40]
Libya[edit]
The company's only North African operation was in Libya. In 2005, Occidental and partner Liwa won eight out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.[41] The company later began enacting an exit strategy to divest assets in the country in 2016.[41]
United Kingdom[edit]
Planning permission was granted in 1971 for Occidental Petroleum to develop a site on Canvey Island Essex for the construction of a conventional distillation oil refinery (Occidental Refineries Ltd.). Access roads, some of the tank farm, a 1.5 km jetty on the River Thames and a 450-foot (140 m) concrete chimney were built. Early in 1975 Occidental stopped work following economic studies which showed the refinery, in the context of the OPEC price rises, was unlikely to be profitable. In 1980 Occidental noted that a 60,000 barrel per day residue upgrading refinery would be viable.[42] However, no further work on the site was undertaken, and the site remained derelict, the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.[43][44]
Current operations[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations are concentrated in three geographic areas: the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East.[4]
As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had 2.406 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.472×1010 GJ) of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 56% was petroleum, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 27% was natural gas.[3]
In 2016, the company had production of 630 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,900,000 GJ) per day.[3]
United States[edit]
In 2016, Occidental's United States operations produced 302 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,850,000 GJ) per day, representing 48% of the company's worldwide production.[3] This includes approximately 269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,650,000 GJ) barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer, and 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day of production in its mid-continent operations in Colorado and South Texas.[3] The 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin includes 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from "unconventional" resources through Permian Resources and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).[3] EOR technology used in the Permian includes water flooding and carbon dioxide flooding, whereby carbon dioxide is injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas.[3]
Middle East[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The region produced 294 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,800,000 GJ) per day, representing approximately 46% of 2016 total worldwide production.[3][45] The region also held 28% of the company's proved reserves in 2016.[3]
Occidental is the largest independent oil producer in Oman.[46] In Qatar, Occidental is the second-largest oil producer offshore[47] and is a partial owner in the Dolphin natural gas project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.[47] In early 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi's state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East,[48] through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.[49]
Latin America[edit]
In Latin America, which accounted for 5% of total production in 2016, Occidental operates in Bolivia and Colombia.[3][50][51] Occidental's share of production from its Latin America assets was approximately 34 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (210,000 GJ) per day in 2016, which included 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day from Colombia.[3]
In Colombia, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in 1983. It proved to be the largest discovery in Colombia's oil history and helped return the country to oil-exporter status.[52]
Chemical[edit]
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, based in Dallas, is a leading chemical manufacturer.[53] Among its interests are basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemical products.[3] Oxy's wholly owned chemical subsidiaries include Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), OxyVinyls, and INDSPEC Chemical Corporation.[54] OxyChem manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine and caustic soda used in plastics, pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated isocyanurates and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Chile.[54]
In a joint venture with Church & Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.[55] In October 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Ingleside Ethylene LLC, to build a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed and the facility to be operational in 2017.[56]
Controversies[edit]
Libya[edit]
Occidental Petroleum began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until U.S. sanctions were imposed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan and was one of the first American company to resume negotiations in Libya after U.S. sanctions were lifted in 2004.[57] In 2008, Occidental Petroleum, along with five other oil companies, was criticized for lobbying to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of the Pan Am flight in Lockerbie in 1988.[58] In 2008, the company hired Hogan & Hartson, a Washington, D.C., law firm as its lobbyist.[59] In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[60] United Kingdom prosecutors, in cooperation with the SEC, have undertaken similar investigations of multiple oil companies during this same period to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.[61] The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.[60] The company later began leaving Libya.[6]
Environmental record[edit]
Oxy has been noted as a leader in using carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology,[62] or carbon sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, which is a more environmental-friendly method of oil extraction because it could stall the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by instead injecting it into the ground.[63]
In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years).[64] Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs[65][66][67] at eight of the company's sites.[68]
Occidental and Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, are participants in a large reclamation project in the southeastern United States at Copper Basin. Occidental acquired the land in 1982, not engaging in mining activities at Copper Basin, including the North Potato Creek Watershed,[69] which were used to mine copper and sulfur dating back to the 1800s. In 2001, Occidental, Glenn Springs Holdings federal and local agencies came to an agreement to clean up Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.[69]
In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Occidental Petroleum as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with about 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[70]
Love Canal[edit]
Further information: Love Canal




An abandoned parking lot near Love Canal


In 1942, Hooker Chemical and Plastics began disposing chemical waste in the Love Canal region. Other companies, as well as the military, had used it as a chemical disposal site since the 1920s. In 1947, Hooker Chemicals became the owner and the sole user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested Hooker, after threatening to resort to eminent domain, sell the land. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump. Hooker Chemical leased the land to the school board in 1953.[71]
A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution.[72]
Oleum spil[edit]
On October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of oleum, a chemical similar to sulfuric acid, occurred at INDSPEC's facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the Petrolia sky. 2,500 residents of the area were asked to evacuate for the day.[73]
Colombia[edit]
Occidental met with substantial resistance from 1992 to 2001 when it tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the "blood of the earth" and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project.[74] Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.
Caño Limón[edit]
Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline
On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón.[75] A lawsuit was attempted in April 2003 against Occidental by Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident.[76] Plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the trial court.[77][78] The dismissal was appealed to 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the trial court to resolve a single issue.[79] The trial court declined to reconsider the case, thereby reinstating the dismissal. The case is once again on appeal.[80]
Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum[edit]
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects.[81] A 2006 study by Peru's health ministry tested 199 people in seven affected communities, and found that all but two had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.[81]
The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.[82]
On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered.[83]
The appeals court overturned the prior decision and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company’s arguments against a domestic trial.[81]
In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.[81]
Political record[edit]
Contributions[edit]
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and industry trade groups on its website.[84]
In 2005, Occidental was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[85][86][87]
Occidental also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.[88]
Front Group Creation[edit]
In 2016, California Resources Corp. created the group Powering California, which teamed up with the Los Angeles Times' “content solutions” team to promote oil-industry messaging.[89] The Los Angeles Times’ "content solutions" department is wholly independent from its reporting and editorial staff.[89]
In 2016, as the California legislature considered extending climate policies, Powering California released a series of videos praising oil and attacking clean energy sources. One of the videos [1] asserts that “renewable energy can’t replace oil,” [2] claims wind energy is “expensive,” and declares that “oil and natural gas are woven into the fabric of America.” Another video features interviews with paid actors touting California’s oil and gas industry.[89]
Gore family[edit]
Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a long-time close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate.[90][91] Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.[92][93] Island Creek Coal was sold to Consol Energy in 1993.[94]
In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion. According to the government, the reserve was no longer strategically necessary, and the reserve was sold to reduce the national debt and the size of the government. To ensure competition, the field was sold in segments and offered to multiple bidders.[95] Critics cited Vice President Al Gore's involvement with the company as evidence of graft.[90]
Safety record[edit]
OxyChem has achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.[96]
Piper Alpha[edit]
Further information: Piper Alpha
On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster.
Greenmail[edit]
In 1984, David Murdock owned about 5% of the company's shares. When Murdock called on the management to take measures to increase the share price, it chose to pay greenmail to buy back shares from him at $40.10, while the market price was $28.75.[97]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
Occidental was founded in 1920 in California. In 1956 Occidental Petroleum came to the attention of Armand Hammer.[10] At Hammer's first association with Occidental, the company was run by Dave Harris, Roy Roberts, and John Sullivan. In 1957, Dr. Armand Hammer was elected president and CEO. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in the Arbuckle area of the Sacramento basin at Lathrop.[11] Over the next 10 years, Occidental expanded internationally with operations in Libya, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. Occidental won exploration rights in Libya in 1965 and operated there until all activities were suspended in 1986 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya.
Occidental entered the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company in 1968, 26 years after the contamination at Love Canal. It added to its chemical industries portfolio in 1988 with the outright purchase for $2 billion of Cain Chemical.[12] On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster.[13]
Tenure of Ray R. Irani[edit]
In 1990, Dr. Ray R. Irani became Occidental Petroleum Corporation's Chairman and CEO. He held the additional title of President from 2005 to 2007. Occidental Petroleum's compensation policies came under scrutiny in 2007 after it was announced that CEO Ray Irani collected $460 million in stock shares and salary in 2006.[14] In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental shareholders, objected to the company's compensation policies for top executives.[15] President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani.[16] Since 1990, Occidental has gone from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas.[17] During Irani's tenure as CEO, Occidental's market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion from $5.4 billion by 2011.[18]
Appointment of Vicki Hollub[edit]
Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015,[2] was announced to be the new CEO effective as of the 2016 annual shareholders' meeting.[19] Hollub was appointed as president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, becoming the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.[20]
In 2015, Oxy was the 16th largest gas producer[8] and 3rd largest oil producer in Texas.[9] The company ranked #364 on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2015.[5] In 2016, it also ranked on the Fortune 500 list.[7]
Phibro Energy trading[edit]
In 2009, Oxy acquired Citigroup's controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million.[21] The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s.[22] In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.[23]
Research in Shale Oil[edit]
Starting in 1972, Occidental Oil Shale, Inc., a former subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, began research on a shale oil extraction process.[24]
The company conducted the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado.[24] The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51 m) area and had height of 400 feet (120 m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort.[25]
During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.[24][25] All together, six retorts have been burned at the site.[24]
Historical financial performance[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, Occidental was one of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies based on market capitalization, with a market capitalization of approximately $51 billion.[3]

Former areas of operation[edit]
California[edit]
Occidental formerly owned 100% of California Resources Corporation,[34] the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California.[35] Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation to Occidental shareholders in December 2014[34] and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016.[3]
Williston Basin, North Dakota[edit]
In 2010, Oxy acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion.[36] These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million.[37]
Argentina[edit]
In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109 GJ).[38]
Ecuador[edit]
Occidental formerly operated in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. The government of Ecuador seized the company's interest in 2006, and in 2016, the government agreed to pay USD$980 million in restitution to Occidental for the seizure, down from the original award of USD$1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).[39]
Brazil[edit]
In 2013, Oxychem sold its investment in Unipar Carbocloro for R$550 million.[40]
Libya[edit]
The company's only North African operation was in Libya. In 2005, Occidental and partner Liwa won eight out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.[41] The company later began enacting an exit strategy to divest assets in the country in 2016.[41]
United Kingdom[edit]
Planning permission was granted in 1971 for Occidental Petroleum to develop a site on Canvey Island Essex for the construction of a conventional distillation oil refinery (Occidental Refineries Ltd.). Access roads, some of the tank farm, a 1.5 km jetty on the River Thames and a 450-foot (140 m) concrete chimney were built. Early in 1975 Occidental stopped work following economic studies which showed the refinery, in the context of the OPEC price rises, was unlikely to be profitable. In 1980 Occidental noted that a 60,000 barrel per day residue upgrading refinery would be viable.[42] However, no further work on the site was undertaken, and the site remained derelict, the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.[43][44]
Current operations[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations are concentrated in three geographic areas: the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East.[4]
As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had 2.406 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.472×1010 GJ) of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 56% was petroleum, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 27% was natural gas.[3]
In 2016, the company had production of 630 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,900,000 GJ) per day.[3]
United States[edit]
In 2016, Occidental's United States operations produced 302 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,850,000 GJ) per day, representing 48% of the company's worldwide production.[3] This includes approximately 269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,650,000 GJ) barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer, and 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day of production in its mid-continent operations in Colorado and South Texas.[3] The 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin includes 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from "unconventional" resources through Permian Resources and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).[3] EOR technology used in the Permian includes water flooding and carbon dioxide flooding, whereby carbon dioxide is injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas.[3]
Middle East[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The region produced 294 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,800,000 GJ) per day, representing approximately 46% of 2016 total worldwide production.[3][45] The region also held 28% of the company's proved reserves in 2016.[3]
Occidental is the largest independent oil producer in Oman.[46] In Qatar, Occidental is the second-largest oil producer offshore[47] and is a partial owner in the Dolphin natural gas project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.[47] In early 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi's state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East,[48] through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.[49]
Latin America[edit]
In Latin America, which accounted for 5% of total production in 2016, Occidental operates in Bolivia and Colombia.[3][50][51] Occidental's share of production from its Latin America assets was approximately 34 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (210,000 GJ) per day in 2016, which included 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day from Colombia.[3]
In Colombia, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in 1983. It proved to be the largest discovery in Colombia's oil history and helped return the country to oil-exporter status.[52]
Chemical[edit]
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, based in Dallas, is a leading chemical manufacturer.[53] Among its interests are basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemical products.[3] Oxy's wholly owned chemical subsidiaries include Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), OxyVinyls, and INDSPEC Chemical Corporation.[54] OxyChem manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine and caustic soda used in plastics, pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated isocyanurates and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Chile.[54]
In a joint venture with Church & Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.[55] In October 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Ingleside Ethylene LLC, to build a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed and the facility to be operational in 2017.[56]
Controversies[edit]
Libya[edit]
Occidental Petroleum began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until U.S. sanctions were imposed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan and was one of the first American company to resume negotiations in Libya after U.S. sanctions were lifted in 2004.[57] In 2008, Occidental Petroleum, along with five other oil companies, was criticized for lobbying to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of the Pan Am flight in Lockerbie in 1988.[58] In 2008, the company hired Hogan & Hartson, a Washington, D.C., law firm as its lobbyist.[59] In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[60] United Kingdom prosecutors, in cooperation with the SEC, have undertaken similar investigations of multiple oil companies during this same period to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.[61] The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.[60] The company later began leaving Libya.[6]
Environmental record[edit]
Oxy has been noted as a leader in using carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology,[62] or carbon sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, which is a more environmental-friendly method of oil extraction because it could stall the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by instead injecting it into the ground.[63]
In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years).[64] Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs[65][66][67] at eight of the company's sites.[68]
Occidental and Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, are participants in a large reclamation project in the southeastern United States at Copper Basin. Occidental acquired the land in 1982, not engaging in mining activities at Copper Basin, including the North Potato Creek Watershed,[69] which were used to mine copper and sulfur dating back to the 1800s. In 2001, Occidental, Glenn Springs Holdings federal and local agencies came to an agreement to clean up Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.[69]
In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Occidental Petroleum as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with about 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[70]
Love Canal[edit]

In 1942, Hooker Chemical and Plastics began disposing chemical waste in the Love Canal region. Other companies, as well as the military, had used it as a chemical disposal site since the 1920s. In 1947, Hooker Chemicals became the owner and the sole user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested Hooker, after threatening to resort to eminent domain, sell the land. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump. Hooker Chemical leased the land to the school board in 1953.[71]
A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution.[72]
Oleum spil[edit]
On October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of oleum, a chemical similar to sulfuric acid, occurred at INDSPEC's facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the Petrolia sky. 2,500 residents of the area were asked to evacuate for the day.[73]
Colombia[edit]
Occidental met with substantial resistance from 1992 to 2001 when it tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the "blood of the earth" and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project.[74] Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.
Caño Limón[edit]
Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline
On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón.[75] A lawsuit was attempted in April 2003 against Occidental by Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident.[76] Plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the trial court.[77][78] The dismissal was appealed to 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the trial court to resolve a single issue.[79] The trial court declined to reconsider the case, thereby reinstating the dismissal. The case is once again on appeal.[80]
Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum[edit]
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects.[81] A 2006 study by Peru's health ministry tested 199 people in seven affected communities, and found that all but two had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.[81]
The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.[82]
On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered.[83]
The appeals court overturned the prior decision and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company’s arguments against a domestic trial.[81]
In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.[81]
Political record[edit]
Contributions[edit]
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and industry trade groups on its website.[84]
In 2005, Occidental was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[85][86][87]
Occidental also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.[88]
Front Group Creation[edit]
In 2016, California Resources Corp. created the group Powering California, which teamed up with the Los Angeles Times' “content solutions” team to promote oil-industry messaging.[89] The Los Angeles Times’ "content solutions" department is wholly independent from its reporting and editorial staff.[89]
In 2016, as the California legislature considered extending climate policies, Powering California released a series of videos praising oil and attacking clean energy sources. One of the videos [1] asserts that “renewable energy can’t replace oil,” [2] claims wind energy is “expensive,” and declares that “oil and natural gas are woven into the fabric of America.” Another video features interviews with paid actors touting California’s oil and gas industry.[89]
Gore family[edit]
Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a long-time close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate.[90][91] Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.[92][93] Island Creek Coal was sold to Consol Energy in 1993.[94]
In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion. According to the government, the reserve was no longer strategically necessary, and the reserve was sold to reduce the national debt and the size of the government. To ensure competition, the field was sold in segments and offered to multiple bidders.[95] Critics cited Vice President Al Gore's involvement with the company as evidence of graft.[90]
Safety record[edit]
OxyChem has achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.[96]
Piper Alpha[edit]
Further information: Piper Alpha
On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster.
Greenmail[edit]
In 1984, David Murdock owned about 5% of the company's shares. When Murdock called on the management to take measures to increase the share price, it chose to pay greenmail to buy back shares from him at $40.10, while the market price was $28.75.[97]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
Occidental was founded in 1920 in California. In 1956 Occidental Petroleum came to the attention of Armand Hammer.[10] At Hammer's first association with Occidental, the company was run by Dave Harris, Roy Roberts, and John Sullivan. In 1957, Dr. Armand Hammer was elected president and CEO. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in the Arbuckle area of the Sacramento basin at Lathrop.[11] Over the next 10 years, Occidental expanded internationally with operations in Libya, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. Occidental won exploration rights in Libya in 1965 and operated there until all activities were suspended in 1986 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya.
Occidental entered the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company in 1968, 26 years after the contamination at Love Canal. It added to its chemical industries portfolio in 1988 with the outright purchase for $2 billion of Cain Chemical.[12] On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster.[13]
Tenure of Ray R. Irani[edit]
In 1990, Dr. Ray R. Irani became Occidental Petroleum Corporation's Chairman and CEO. He held the additional title of President from 2005 to 2007. Occidental Petroleum's compensation policies came under scrutiny in 2007 after it was announced that CEO Ray Irani collected $460 million in stock shares and salary in 2006.[14] In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental shareholders, objected to the company's compensation policies for top executives.[15] President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani.[16] Since 1990, Occidental has gone from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas.[17] During Irani's tenure as CEO, Occidental's market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion from $5.4 billion by 2011.[18]
Appointment of Vicki Hollub[edit]
Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015,[2] was announced to be the new CEO effective as of the 2016 annual shareholders' meeting.[19] Hollub was appointed as president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, becoming the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.[20]
In 2015, Oxy was the 16th largest gas producer[8] and 3rd largest oil producer in Texas.[9] The company ranked #364 on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2015.[5] In 2016, it also ranked on the Fortune 500 list.[7]
Phibro Energy trading[edit]
In 2009, Oxy acquired Citigroup's controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million.[21] The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s.[22] In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.[23]
Research in Shale Oil[edit]
Starting in 1972, Occidental Oil Shale, Inc., a former subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, began research on a shale oil extraction process.[24]
The company conducted the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado.[24] The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51 m) area and had height of 400 feet (120 m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort.[25]
During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.[24][25] All together, six retorts have been burned at the site.[24]
Historical financial performance[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, Occidental was one of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies based on market capitalization, with a market capitalization of approximately $51 billion.[3]

Former areas of operation[edit]
California[edit]
Occidental formerly owned 100% of California Resources Corporation,[34] the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California.[35] Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation to Occidental shareholders in December 2014[34] and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016.[3]
Williston Basin, North Dakota[edit]
In 2010, Oxy acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion.[36] These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million.[37]
Argentina[edit]
In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109 GJ).[38]
Ecuador[edit]
Occidental formerly operated in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. The government of Ecuador seized the company's interest in 2006, and in 2016, the government agreed to pay USD$980 million in restitution to Occidental for the seizure, down from the original award of USD$1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).[39]
Brazil[edit]
In 2013, Oxychem sold its investment in Unipar Carbocloro for R$550 million.[40]
Libya[edit]
The company's only North African operation was in Libya. In 2005, Occidental and partner Liwa won eight out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.[41] The company later began enacting an exit strategy to divest assets in the country in 2016.[41]
United Kingdom[edit]
Planning permission was granted in 1971 for Occidental Petroleum to develop a site on Canvey Island Essex for the construction of a conventional distillation oil refinery (Occidental Refineries Ltd.). Access roads, some of the tank farm, a 1.5 km jetty on the River Thames and a 450-foot (140 m) concrete chimney were built. Early in 1975 Occidental stopped work following economic studies which showed the refinery, in the context of the OPEC price rises, was unlikely to be profitable. In 1980 Occidental noted that a 60,000 barrel per day residue upgrading refinery would be viable.[42] However, no further work on the site was undertaken, and the site remained derelict, the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.[43][44]
Current operations[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations are concentrated in three geographic areas: the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East.[4]
As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had 2.406 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.472×1010 GJ) of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 56% was petroleum, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 27% was natural gas.[3]
In 2016, the company had production of 630 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,900,000 GJ) per day.[3]
United States[edit]
In 2016, Occidental's United States operations produced 302 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,850,000 GJ) per day, representing 48% of the company's worldwide production.[3] This includes approximately 269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,650,000 GJ) barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer, and 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day of production in its mid-continent operations in Colorado and South Texas.[3] The 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin includes 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from "unconventional" resources through Permian Resources and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).[3] EOR technology used in the Permian includes water flooding and carbon dioxide flooding, whereby carbon dioxide is injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas.[3]
Middle East[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The region produced 294 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,800,000 GJ) per day, representing approximately 46% of 2016 total worldwide production.[3][45] The region also held 28% of the company's proved reserves in 2016.[3]
Occidental is the largest independent oil producer in Oman.[46] In Qatar, Occidental is the second-largest oil producer offshore[47] and is a partial owner in the Dolphin natural gas project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.[47] In early 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi's state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East,[48] through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.[49]
Latin America[edit]
In Latin America, which accounted for 5% of total production in 2016, Occidental operates in Bolivia and Colombia.[3][50][51] Occidental's share of production from its Latin America assets was approximately 34 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (210,000 GJ) per day in 2016, which included 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day from Colombia.[3]
In Colombia, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in 1983. It proved to be the largest discovery in Colombia's oil history and helped return the country to oil-exporter status.[52]
Chemical[edit]
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, based in Dallas, is a leading chemical manufacturer.[53] Among its interests are basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemical products.[3] Oxy's wholly owned chemical subsidiaries include Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), OxyVinyls, and INDSPEC Chemical Corporation.[54] OxyChem manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine and caustic soda used in plastics, pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated isocyanurates and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Chile.[54]
In a joint venture with Church & Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.[55] In October 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Ingleside Ethylene LLC, to build a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed and the facility to be operational in 2017.[56]
Controversies[edit]
Libya[edit]
Occidental Petroleum began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until U.S. sanctions were imposed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan and was one of the first American company to resume negotiations in Libya after U.S. sanctions were lifted in 2004.[57] In 2008, Occidental Petroleum, along with five other oil companies, was criticized for lobbying to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of the Pan Am flight in Lockerbie in 1988.[58] In 2008, the company hired Hogan & Hartson, a Washington, D.C., law firm as its lobbyist.[59] In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[60] United Kingdom prosecutors, in cooperation with the SEC, have undertaken similar investigations of multiple oil companies during this same period to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.[61] The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.[60] The company later began leaving Libya.[6]
Environmental record[edit]
Oxy has been noted as a leader in using carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology,[62] or carbon sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, which is a more environmental-friendly method of oil extraction because it could stall the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by instead injecting it into the ground.[63]
In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years).[64] Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs[65][66][67] at eight of the company's sites.[68]
Occidental and Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, are participants in a large reclamation project in the southeastern United States at Copper Basin. Occidental acquired the land in 1982, not engaging in mining activities at Copper Basin, including the North Potato Creek Watershed,[69] which were used to mine copper and sulfur dating back to the 1800s. In 2001, Occidental, Glenn Springs Holdings federal and local agencies came to an agreement to clean up Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.[69]
In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Occidental Petroleum as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with about 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[70]
Love Canal[edit]

An abandoned parking lot near Love Canal


In 1942, Hooker Chemical and Plastics began disposing chemical waste in the Love Canal region. Other companies, as well as the military, had used it as a chemical disposal site since the 1920s. In 1947, Hooker Chemicals became the owner and the sole user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested Hooker, after threatening to resort to eminent domain, sell the land. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump. Hooker Chemical leased the land to the school board in 1953.[71]
A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution.[72]
Oleum spil[edit]
On October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of oleum, a chemical similar to sulfuric acid, occurred at INDSPEC's facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the Petrolia sky. 2,500 residents of the area were asked to evacuate for the day.[73]
Colombia[edit]
Occidental met with substantial resistance from 1992 to 2001 when it tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the "blood of the earth" and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project.[74] Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.
Caño Limón[edit]
Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline
On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón.[75] A lawsuit was attempted in April 2003 against Occidental by Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident.[76] Plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the trial court.[77][78] The dismissal was appealed to 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the trial court to resolve a single issue.[79] The trial court declined to reconsider the case, thereby reinstating the dismissal. The case is once again on appeal.[80]
Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum[edit]
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects.[81] A 2006 study by Peru's health ministry tested 199 people in seven affected communities, and found that all but two had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.[81]
The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.[82]
On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered.[83]
The appeals court overturned the prior decision and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company’s arguments against a domestic trial.[81]
In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.[81]
Political record[edit]
Contributions[edit]
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and industry trade groups on its website.[84]
In 2005, Occidental was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[85][86][87]
Occidental also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.[88]
Front Group Creation[edit]
In 2016, California Resources Corp. created the group Powering California, which teamed up with the Los Angeles Times' “content solutions” team to promote oil-industry messaging.[89] The Los Angeles Times’ "content solutions" department is wholly independent from its reporting and editorial staff.[89]
In 2016, as the California legislature considered extending climate policies, Powering California released a series of videos praising oil and attacking clean energy sources. One of the videos [1] asserts that “renewable energy can’t replace oil,” [2] claims wind energy is “expensive,” and declares that “oil and natural gas are woven into the fabric of America.” Another video features interviews with paid actors touting California’s oil and gas industry.[89]
Gore family[edit]
Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a long-time close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate.[90][91] Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.[92][93] Island Creek Coal was sold to Consol Energy in 1993.[94]
In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion. According to the government, the reserve was no longer strategically necessary, and the reserve was sold to reduce the national debt and the size of the government. To ensure competition, the field was sold in segments and offered to multiple bidders.[95] Critics cited Vice President Al Gore's involvement with the company as evidence of graft.[90]
Safety record[edit]
OxyChem has achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.[96]
Piper Alpha[edit]
Further information: Piper Alpha
On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster.
Greenmail[edit]
In 1984, David Murdock owned about 5% of the company's shares. When Murdock called on the management to take measures to increase the share price, it chose to pay greenmail to buy back shares from him at $40.10, while the market price was $28.75.[97]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
Occidental was founded in 1920 in California. In 1956 Occidental Petroleum came to the attention of Armand Hammer.[10] At Hammer's first association with Occidental, the company was run by Dave Harris, Roy Roberts, and John Sullivan. In 1957, Dr. Armand Hammer was elected president and CEO. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in the Arbuckle area of the Sacramento basin at Lathrop.[11] Over the next 10 years, Occidental expanded internationally with operations in Libya, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. Occidental won exploration rights in Libya in 1965 and operated there until all activities were suspended in 1986 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya.
Occidental entered the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company in 1968, 26 years after the contamination at Love Canal. It added to its chemical industries portfolio in 1988 with the outright purchase for $2 billion of Cain Chemical.[12] On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster.[13]
Tenure of Ray R. Irani[edit]
In 1990, Dr. Ray R. Irani became Occidental Petroleum Corporation's Chairman and CEO. He held the additional title of President from 2005 to 2007. Occidental Petroleum's compensation policies came under scrutiny in 2007 after it was announced that CEO Ray Irani collected $460 million in stock shares and salary in 2006.[14] In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental shareholders, objected to the company's compensation policies for top executives.[15] President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani.[16] Since 1990, Occidental has gone from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas.[17] During Irani's tenure as CEO, Occidental's market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion from $5.4 billion by 2011.[18]
Appointment of Vicki Hollub[edit]
Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015,[2] was announced to be the new CEO effective as of the 2016 annual shareholders' meeting.[19] Hollub was appointed as president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, becoming the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.[20]
In 2015, Oxy was the 16th largest gas producer[8] and 3rd largest oil producer in Texas.[9] The company ranked #364 on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2015.[5] In 2016, it also ranked on the Fortune 500 list.[7]
Phibro Energy trading[edit]
In 2009, Oxy acquired Citigroup's controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million.[21] The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s.[22] In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.[23]
Research in Shale Oil[edit]
Starting in 1972, Occidental Oil Shale, Inc., a former subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, began research on a shale oil extraction process.[24]
The company conducted the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado.[24] The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51 m) area and had height of 400 feet (120 m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort.[25]
During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.[24][25] All together, six retorts have been burned at the site.[24]
Historical financial performance[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, Occidental was one of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies based on market capitalization, with a market capitalization of approximately $51 billion.[3]

Former areas of operation[edit]
California[edit]
Occidental formerly owned 100% of California Resources Corporation,[34] the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California.[35] Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation to Occidental shareholders in December 2014[34] and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016.[3]
Williston Basin, North Dakota[edit]
In 2010, Oxy acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion.[36] These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million.[37]
Argentina[edit]
In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109 GJ).[38]
Ecuador[edit]
Occidental formerly operated in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. The government of Ecuador seized the company's interest in 2006, and in 2016, the government agreed to pay USD$980 million in restitution to Occidental for the seizure, down from the original award of USD$1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).[39]
Brazil[edit]
In 2013, Oxychem sold its investment in Unipar Carbocloro for R$550 million.[40]
Libya[edit]
The company's only North African operation was in Libya. In 2005, Occidental and partner Liwa won eight out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.[41] The company later began enacting an exit strategy to divest assets in the country in 2016.[41]
United Kingdom[edit]
Planning permission was granted in 1971 for Occidental Petroleum to develop a site on Canvey Island Essex for the construction of a conventional distillation oil refinery (Occidental Refineries Ltd.). Access roads, some of the tank farm, a 1.5 km jetty on the River Thames and a 450-foot (140 m) concrete chimney were built. Early in 1975 Occidental stopped work following economic studies which showed the refinery, in the context of the OPEC price rises, was unlikely to be profitable. In 1980 Occidental noted that a 60,000 barrel per day residue upgrading refinery would be viable.[42] However, no further work on the site was undertaken, and the site remained derelict, the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.[43][44]
Current operations[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations are concentrated in three geographic areas: the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East.[4]
As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had 2.406 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.472×1010 GJ) of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 56% was petroleum, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 27% was natural gas.[3]
In 2016, the company had production of 630 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,900,000 GJ) per day.[3]
United States[edit]
In 2016, Occidental's United States operations produced 302 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,850,000 GJ) per day, representing 48% of the company's worldwide production.[3] This includes approximately 269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,650,000 GJ) barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer, and 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day of production in its mid-continent operations in Colorado and South Texas.[3] The 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin includes 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from "unconventional" resources through Permian Resources and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).[3] EOR technology used in the Permian includes water flooding and carbon dioxide flooding, whereby carbon dioxide is injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas.[3]
Middle East[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The region produced 294 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,800,000 GJ) per day, representing approximately 46% of 2016 total worldwide production.[3][45] The region also held 28% of the company's proved reserves in 2016.[3]
Occidental is the largest independent oil producer in Oman.[46] In Qatar, Occidental is the second-largest oil producer offshore[47] and is a partial owner in the Dolphin natural gas project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.[47] In early 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi's state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East,[48] through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.[49]
Latin America[edit]
In Latin America, which accounted for 5% of total production in 2016, Occidental operates in Bolivia and Colombia.[3][50][51] Occidental's share of production from its Latin America assets was approximately 34 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (210,000 GJ) per day in 2016, which included 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day from Colombia.[3]
In Colombia, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in 1983. It proved to be the largest discovery in Colombia's oil history and helped return the country to oil-exporter status.[52]
Chemical[edit]
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, based in Dallas, is a leading chemical manufacturer.[53] Among its interests are basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemical products.[3] Oxy's wholly owned chemical subsidiaries include Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), OxyVinyls, and INDSPEC Chemical Corporation.[54] OxyChem manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine and caustic soda used in plastics, pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated isocyanurates and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Chile.[54]
In a joint venture with Church & Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.[55] In October 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Ingleside Ethylene LLC, to build a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed and the facility to be operational in 2017.[56]

Occidental Petroleum began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until U.S. sanctions were imposed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan and was one of the first American company to resume negotiations in Libya after U.S. sanctions were lifted in 2004.[57] In 2008, Occidental Petroleum, along with five other oil companies, was criticized for lobbying to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of the Pan Am flight in Lockerbie in 1988.[58] In 2008, the company hired Hogan & Hartson, a Washington, D.C., law firm as its lobbyist.[59] In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[60] United Kingdom prosecutors, in cooperation with the SEC, have undertaken similar investigations of multiple oil companies during this same period to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.[61] The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.[60] The company later began leaving Libya.[6]
Environmental record[edit]
Oxy has been noted as a leader in using carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology,[62] or carbon sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, which is a more environmental-friendly method of oil extraction because it could stall the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by instead injecting it into the ground.[63]
In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years).[64] Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs[65][66][67] at eight of the company's sites.[68]
Occidental and Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, are participants in a large reclamation project in the southeastern United States at Copper Basin. Occidental acquired the land in 1982, not engaging in mining activities at Copper Basin, including the North Potato Creek Watershed,[69] which were used to mine copper and sulfur dating back to the 1800s. In 2001, Occidental, Glenn Springs Holdings federal and local agencies came to an agreement to clean up Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.[69]
In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Occidental Petroleum as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with about 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[70]
Love Canal[edit]

In 1942, Hooker Chemical and Plastics began disposing chemical waste in the Love Canal region. Other companies, as well as the military, had used it as a chemical disposal site since the 1920s. In 1947, Hooker Chemicals became the owner and the sole user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested Hooker, after threatening to resort to eminent domain, sell the land. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump. Hooker Chemical leased the land to the school board in 1953.[71]
A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution.[72]
Oleum spil[edit]
On October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of oleum, a chemical similar to sulfuric acid, occurred at INDSPEC's facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the Petrolia sky. 2,500 residents of the area were asked to evacuate for the day.[73]
Colombia[edit]
Occidental met with substantial resistance from 1992 to 2001 when it tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the "blood of the earth" and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project.[74] Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.
Caño Limón[edit]
Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline
On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón.[75] A lawsuit was attempted in April 2003 against Occidental by Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident.[76] Plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the trial court.[77][78] The dismissal was appealed to 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the trial court to resolve a single issue.[79] The trial court declined to reconsider the case, thereby reinstating the dismissal. The case is once again on appeal.[80]
Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum[edit]
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects.[81] A 2006 study by Peru's health ministry tested 199 people in seven affected communities, and found that all but two had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.[81]
The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.[82]
On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered.[83]
The appeals court overturned the prior decision and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company’s arguments against a domestic trial.[81]
In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.[81]
Political record[edit]
Contributions[edit]
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and industry trade groups on its website.[84]
In 2005, Occidental was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[85][86][87]
Occidental also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.[88]
Front Group Creation[edit]
In 2016, California Resources Corp. created the group Powering California, which teamed up with the Los Angeles Times' “content solutions” team to promote oil-industry messaging.[89] The Los Angeles Times’ "content solutions" department is wholly independent from its reporting and editorial staff.[89]
In 2016, as the California legislature considered extending climate policies, Powering California released a series of videos praising oil and attacking clean energy sources. One of the videos [1] asserts that “renewable energy can’t replace oil,” [2] claims wind energy is “expensive,” and declares that “oil and natural gas are woven into the fabric of America.” Another video features interviews with paid actors touting California’s oil and gas industry.[89]
Gore family[edit]
Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a long-time close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate.[90][91] Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.[92][93] Island Creek Coal was sold to Consol Energy in 1993.[94]
In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion. According to the government, the reserve was no longer strategically necessary, and the reserve was sold to reduce the national debt and the size of the government. To ensure competition, the field was sold in segments and offered to multiple bidders.[95] Critics cited Vice President Al Gore's involvement with the company as evidence of graft.[90]
Safety record[edit]
OxyChem has achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.[96]
Piper Alpha[edit]
Further information: Piper Alpha
On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster.
Greenmail[edit]
In 1984, David Murdock owned about 5% of the company's shares. When Murdock called on the management to take measures to increase the share price, it chose to pay greenmail to buy back shares from him at $40.10, while the market price was $28.75.[97]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
Occidental was founded in 1920 in California. In 1956 Occidental Petroleum came to the attention of Armand Hammer.[10] At Hammer's first association with Occidental, the company was run by Dave Harris, Roy Roberts, and John Sullivan. In 1957, Dr. Armand Hammer was elected president and CEO. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in the Arbuckle area of the Sacramento basin at Lathrop.[11] Over the next 10 years, Occidental expanded internationally with operations in Libya, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. Occidental won exploration rights in Libya in 1965 and operated there until all activities were suspended in 1986 after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya.
Occidental entered the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company in 1968, 26 years after the contamination at Love Canal. It added to its chemical industries portfolio in 1988 with the outright purchase for $2 billion of Cain Chemical.[12] On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster.[13]
Tenure of Ray R. Irani[edit]
In 1990, Dr. Ray R. Irani became Occidental Petroleum Corporation's Chairman and CEO. He held the additional title of President from 2005 to 2007. Occidental Petroleum's compensation policies came under scrutiny in 2007 after it was announced that CEO Ray Irani collected $460 million in stock shares and salary in 2006.[14] In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental shareholders, objected to the company's compensation policies for top executives.[15] President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani.[16] Since 1990, Occidental has gone from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas.[17] During Irani's tenure as CEO, Occidental's market capitalization increased to more than $80 billion from $5.4 billion by 2011.[18]
Appointment of Vicki Hollub[edit]
Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015,[2] was announced to be the new CEO effective as of the 2016 annual shareholders' meeting.[19] Hollub was appointed as president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, becoming the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.[20]
In 2015, Oxy was the 16th largest gas producer[8] and 3rd largest oil producer in Texas.[9] The company ranked #364 on the Forbes Global 2000 list in 2015.[5] In 2016, it also ranked on the Fortune 500 list.[7]
Phibro Energy trading[edit]
In 2009, Oxy acquired Citigroup's controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million.[21] The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s.[22] In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.[23]
Research in Shale Oil[edit]
Starting in 1972, Occidental Oil Shale, Inc., a former subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, began research on a shale oil extraction process.[24]
The company conducted the first modified in situ oil shale experiment in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado.[24] The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51 m) area and had height of 400 feet (120 m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort.[25]
During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.[24][25] All together, six retorts have been burned at the site.[24]
Historical financial performance[edit]
As of December 31, 2015, Occidental was one of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies based on market capitalization, with a market capitalization of approximately $51 billion.[3]

Former areas of operation[edit]
California[edit]
Occidental formerly owned 100% of California Resources Corporation,[34] the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California.[35] Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation to Occidental shareholders in December 2014[34] and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016.[3]
Williston Basin, North Dakota[edit]
In 2010, Oxy acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion.[36] These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million.[37]
Argentina[edit]
In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393 million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109 GJ).[38]
Ecuador[edit]
Occidental formerly operated in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest in Ecuador. The government of Ecuador seized the company's interest in 2006, and in 2016, the government agreed to pay USD$980 million in restitution to Occidental for the seizure, down from the original award of USD$1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).[39]
Brazil[edit]
In 2013, Oxychem sold its investment in Unipar Carbocloro for R$550 million.[40]
Libya[edit]
The company's only North African operation was in Libya. In 2005, Occidental and partner Liwa won eight out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.[41] The company later began enacting an exit strategy to divest assets in the country in 2016.[41]
United Kingdom[edit]
Planning permission was granted in 1971 for Occidental Petroleum to develop a site on Canvey Island Essex for the construction of a conventional distillation oil refinery (Occidental Refineries Ltd.). Access roads, some of the tank farm, a 1.5 km jetty on the River Thames and a 450-foot (140 m) concrete chimney were built. Early in 1975 Occidental stopped work following economic studies which showed the refinery, in the context of the OPEC price rises, was unlikely to be profitable. In 1980 Occidental noted that a 60,000 barrel per day residue upgrading refinery would be viable.[42] However, no further work on the site was undertaken, and the site remained derelict, the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.[43][44]
Current operations[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations are concentrated in three geographic areas: the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East.[4]
As of December 31, 2016, Occidental had 2.406 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.472×1010 GJ) of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 56% was petroleum, 17% was natural gas liquids, and 27% was natural gas.[3]
In 2016, the company had production of 630 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,900,000 GJ) per day.[3]
United States[edit]
In 2016, Occidental's United States operations produced 302 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,850,000 GJ) per day, representing 48% of the company's worldwide production.[3] This includes approximately 269 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,650,000 GJ) barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer, and 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day of production in its mid-continent operations in Colorado and South Texas.[3] The 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Permian Basin includes 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from "unconventional" resources through Permian Resources and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).[3] EOR technology used in the Permian includes water flooding and carbon dioxide flooding, whereby carbon dioxide is injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas.[3]
Middle East[edit]
Occidental's oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The region produced 294 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,800,000 GJ) per day, representing approximately 46% of 2016 total worldwide production.[3][45] The region also held 28% of the company's proved reserves in 2016.[3]
Occidental is the largest independent oil producer in Oman.[46] In Qatar, Occidental is the second-largest oil producer offshore[47] and is a partial owner in the Dolphin natural gas project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.[47] In early 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi's state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East,[48] through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.[49]
Latin America[edit]
In Latin America, which accounted for 5% of total production in 2016, Occidental operates in Bolivia and Colombia.[3][50][51] Occidental's share of production from its Latin America assets was approximately 34 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (210,000 GJ) per day in 2016, which included 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (200,000 GJ) per day from Colombia.[3]
In Colombia, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in 1983. It proved to be the largest discovery in Colombia's oil history and helped return the country to oil-exporter status.[52]
Chemical[edit]
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, based in Dallas, is a leading chemical manufacturer.[53] Among its interests are basic chemicals, vinyls and performance chemical products.[3] Oxy's wholly owned chemical subsidiaries include Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem), OxyVinyls, and INDSPEC Chemical Corporation.[54] OxyChem manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine and caustic soda used in plastics, pharmaceuticals and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated isocyanurates and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Chile.[54]
In a joint venture with Church & Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.[55] In October 2013, OxyChem and Mexichem announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, Ingleside Ethylene LLC, to build a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas. Construction is expected to be completed and the facility to be operational in 2017.[56]
Controversies[edit]
Libya[edit]
Occidental Petroleum began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until U.S. sanctions were imposed in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan and was one of the first American company to resume negotiations in Libya after U.S. sanctions were lifted in 2004.[57] In 2008, Occidental Petroleum, along with five other oil companies, was criticized for lobbying to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of the Pan Am flight in Lockerbie in 1988.[58] In 2008, the company hired Hogan & Hartson, a Washington, D.C., law firm as its lobbyist.[59] In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[60] United Kingdom prosecutors, in cooperation with the SEC, have undertaken similar investigations of multiple oil companies during this same period to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws.[61] The Libyan Investment Authority's investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime's attacks on Libyan civilians.[60] The company later began leaving Libya.[6]
Environmental record[edit]
Oxy has been noted as a leader in using carbon dioxide (CO2) flood technology,[62] or carbon sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, which is a more environmental-friendly method of oil extraction because it could stall the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by instead injecting it into the ground.[63]
In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years).[64] Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs[65][66][67] at eight of the company's sites.[68]
Occidental and Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, are participants in a large reclamation project in the southeastern United States at Copper Basin. Occidental acquired the land in 1982, not engaging in mining activities at Copper Basin, including the North Potato Creek Watershed,[69] which were used to mine copper and sulfur dating back to the 1800s. In 2001, Occidental, Glenn Springs Holdings federal and local agencies came to an agreement to clean up Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.[69]
In 2013, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Occidental Petroleum as the 19th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with about 1.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.[70]
Love Canal[edit]

An abandoned parking lot near Love Canal


In 1942, Hooker Chemical and Plastics began disposing chemical waste in the Love Canal region. Other companies, as well as the military, had used it as a chemical disposal site since the 1920s. In 1947, Hooker Chemicals became the owner and the sole user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. Later in the 1950s, the local school board requested Hooker, after threatening to resort to eminent domain, sell the land. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump. Hooker Chemical leased the land to the school board in 1953.[71]
A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2 m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution.[72]
Oleum spil[edit]
On October 11, 2008, an accidental spill of oleum, a chemical similar to sulfuric acid, occurred at INDSPEC's facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania. The accident caused contamination of the ventilation system and a cloud of toxic gas in the Petrolia sky. 2,500 residents of the area were asked to evacuate for the day.[73]
Colombia[edit]
Occidental met with substantial resistance from 1992 to 2001 when it tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U'wa people in northeast Colombia. The locals were concerned about environmental damage and feared that development would bring strangers and invite violence to the region. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the "blood of the earth" and should not be removed. They believed that oil infrastructure would be a target for violent leftist guerillas in the country. After years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project.[74] Repsol YPF took over the project and continues to work on it.
Caño Limón[edit]
Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline
On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón.[75] A lawsuit was attempted in April 2003 against Occidental by Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident.[76] Plaintiffs claims were dismissed by the trial court.[77][78] The dismissal was appealed to 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the trial court to resolve a single issue.[79] The trial court declined to reconsider the case, thereby reinstating the dismissal. The case is once again on appeal.[80]
Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum[edit]
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9 m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects.[81] A 2006 study by Peru's health ministry tested 199 people in seven affected communities, and found that all but two had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.[81]
The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris & Hoffman LLP.[82]
On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered.[83]
The appeals court overturned the prior decision and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company’s arguments against a domestic trial.[81]
In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.[81]
Political record[edit]
Contributions[edit]
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and industry trade groups on its website.[84]
In 2005, Occidental was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.[85][86][87]
Occidental also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.[88]
Front Group Creation[edit]
In 2016, California Resources Corp. created the group Powering California, which teamed up with the Los Angeles Times' “content solutions” team to promote oil-industry messaging.[89] The Los Angeles Times’ "content solutions" department is wholly independent from its reporting and editorial staff.[89]
In 2016, as the California legislature considered extending climate policies, Powering California released a series of videos praising oil and attacking clean energy sources. One of the videos [1] asserts that “renewable energy can’t replace oil,” [2] claims wind energy is “expensive,” and declares that “oil and natural gas are woven into the fabric of America.” Another video features interviews with paid actors touting California’s oil and gas industry.[89]
Gore family[edit]
Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a long-time close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate.[90][91] Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.[92][93] Island Creek Coal was sold to Consol Energy in 1993.[94]
In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion. According to the government, the reserve was no longer strategically necessary, and the reserve was sold to reduce the national debt and the size of the government. To ensure competition, the field was sold in segments and offered to multiple bidders.[95] Critics cited Vice President Al Gore's involvement with the company as evidence of graft.[90]
Safety record[edit]
OxyChem has achieved Star Status under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.[96]
Piper Alpha[edit]
Further information: Piper Alpha
On July 6, 1988 Occidental's Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the UK North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world's deadliest offshore disaster.
Greenmail[edit]
In 1984, David Murdock owned about 5% of the company's shares. When Murdock called on the management to take measures to increase the share price, it chose to pay greenmail to buy back shares from him at $40.10, while the market price was $28.75.[97]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Portions of this report contain forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially, and reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause results to differ include, but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations; supply and demand considerations for Occidental's products; higher-than-expected costs; the regulatory approval environment; not successfully completing, or any material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency projects, acquisitions or dispositions; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; exploration risks; general economic slowdowns domestically or internationally; political conditions and events; liability under environmental regulations including remedial actions; litigation; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, natural disasters, cyber attacks or insurgent activity; failure of risk management; changes in law or regulations; reorganization or restructuring of Occidental's operations; or changes in tax rates. Words such as "estimate," "project," "predict," "will," "would," "should," "could," "may," "might," "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "aim," "goal," "target," "objective," "likely" or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Material risks that may affect Occidental's results of operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of Occidental's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the 2016 Form 10-K).  Consolidated Results of Operations  Occidental reported net income of $117 million for the first quarter of 2017 on net sales of $3.0 billion, compared to net income of $78 million on net sales of $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2016. The change mainly reflected higher oil prices which were partially offset by the income from discontinued operations reported in the first quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $0.15 and $0.10 for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Selected Statements of Operations Items  Net sales increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, due to higher oil, caustic soda, vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride prices.  Cost of sales increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, mainly due to higher prices for chemical raw materials, ethylene and energy. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, mainly due to lower DD&A rates in the Permian Resources oil and gas operations.  The domestic and foreign income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, reflected higher pre-tax operating income in 2017 compared to a pre-tax operating loss in 2016.  Selected Analysis of Financial Position  See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  The increase in trade receivables, net, at March 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, was primarily due to higher oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2017. The increase in inventories at March 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, reflected higher crude oil storage. Assets held for sale reflected assets from the South Texas operations sold in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in property, plant and equipment, net at March 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, is primarily the result of $0.9 billion of DD&A, partially offset by capital expenditures of $0.7 billion. Current maturities of long-term debt at March 31, 2017, reflected the reclassification of 1.5-percent senior notes due February 2018 out of long-term debt.  Segment Operations  Occidental conducts its operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas;  The following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 (in millions):   Three months ended March 31 2017 2016 Net Sales (a) Oil and Gas $ 1,894 $ 1,275 Chemical 1,068 890 Midstream and Marketing 211 133 Eliminations (216 ) (175 ) $ 2,957 $ 2,123 Segment Results (b) Oil and Gas $ 220 $ (485 ) Chemical 170 214 Midstream and Marketing (47 ) (95 ) 343 (366 ) Unallocated Corporate Items (b) Interest expense, net (78 ) (57 ) Income tax (expense) benefit (78 ) 203 Other expense, net (70 ) (140 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 117 (360 ) Discontinued operations, net - 438 Net income $ 117 $ 78  (a) Intersegment sales eliminate upon consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would be able to obtain in third-party transactions.  Significant Transactions and Events Affecting Earnings The following table sets forth significant transactions and events that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount, affecting Occidental's earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 (in millions): Three months ended March 31 2017 2016 Oil and Gas Asset sales gains and other $ - $ 23 Total Oil and Gas $ - $ 23 Chemical Asset sales gains $ - $ 88 Total Chemical $ - $ 88 Midstream and Marketing No significant transactions $ - $ - Corporate Asset impairments and related items $ - $ (78 ) Tax effect of pre-tax adjustments (a) - 33 Discontinued operations, net (b) - 438 Total Corporate $ - $ 393 Total $ - $ 504  (a) The 2016 amount included benefits for the relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks.  Worldwide Effective Tax Rate The following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 (in millions): Three months ended March 31 2017 2016 Oil and Gas $ 220 $ (485 ) Chemical 170 214 Midstream and Marketing (47 ) (95 ) Unallocated Corporate Items (148 ) (197 ) Pre-tax Income (loss) 195 (563 ) Income tax expense (benefit) Federal and state (113 ) (291 ) Foreign 191 88 Total 78 (203 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 117 $ (360 ) Worldwide effective tax rate 40 % 36 %  Oil and Gas Segment  Oil and gas segment earnings were $220 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared with segment losses of $485 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in earnings is primarily due to significantly higher realized oil prices. The pre-tax results for the first quarter of 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $121 million related to the sale of Piceance Basin operations.  The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016. The differences between the production and sales volumes per day are generally due to the timing of shipments at Occidental's international locations where the product is loaded onto tankers.   Three months ended March 31 Production Volumes per Day 2017 2016 Oil (MBBL) United States 192 197 Middle East 152 182 Latin America 28 38 NGLs (MBBL) United States 52 54 Middle East 26 22 Natural Gas (MMCF) United States 352 388 Middle East 444 588 Latin America 8 8 Total Production Volumes (MBOE) (a) 584 657 Three months ended March 31 Sales Volumes per Day 2017 2016 Oil (MBBL) United States 192 197 Middle East 152 180 Latin America 27 34 NGLs (MBBL) United States 52 54 Middle East 26 22 Natural Gas (MMCF) United States 352 388 Middle East 444 588 Latin America 8 8 Total Sales Volumes (MBOE) (a) 583 651  (See footnote following the table below)  The following tables set forth the production and sales volumes of ongoing operations for oil, NGLs and natural gas per day for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016; this excludes operations sold, exited or exiting.   Three months ended March 31 Production Volumes per Day 2017 2016 Oil (MBBL) United States (b) 190 194 Middle East (c) 152 162 Latin America 28 38 NGLs (MBBL) United States (b) 47 47 Middle East 26 22 Natural Gas (MMCF) United States (b) 244 222 Middle East (c) 444 358 Latin America 8 8 Total Production Ongoing Operations (MBOE) 559 561 Operations Sold, Exited and Exiting 25 96 Total Production Volumes (MBOE) (a) 584 657 Three months ended March 31 Sales Volumes per Day 2017 2016 Oil (MBBL) United States (b) 190 194 Middle East (c) 152 160 Latin America 27 34 NGLs (MBBL) United States (b) 47 47 Middle East 26 22 Natural Gas (MMCF) United States (b) 244 222 Middle East (c) 444 358 Latin America 8 8 Total Sales Ongoing Operations (MBOE) 558 555 Operations Sold, Exited and Exiting 25 96 Total Sales Volumes (MBOE) (a) 583 651  Note: MBBL represents thousand barrels. MMCF represents million cubic feet.  Total average daily production volumes were 584,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 657,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2016. In 2017, Occidental entered into a sales agreement to sell its non-core South Texas operations; this transaction closed in April 2017. In 2016, Occidental completed the sale of the Piceance Basin operations and exited Bahrain and Iraq. These non-core domestic and international operations produced average daily volumes of 25,000 BOE and 96,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the first quarter of 2017, total company average daily oil and gas production volumes for ongoing operations decreased by 2,000  BOE to 559,000 BOE from 561,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2016. Domestic average daily production for ongoing operations remained unchanged at 278,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2017, compared to the same prior-year period. International average daily production for ongoing operations decreased to 281,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2017 from 283,000 BOE in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in international production is primarily attributable to pipeline disruptions in Colombia and planned maintenance at Dolphin, which were partially offset by an increase in production at Al Hosn Gas.  The following tables present information about Occidental's average realized prices and index prices for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016:   Three months ended March 31 Average Realized Prices 2017 2016 Oil ($/BBL) United States $ 48.67 $ 29.48 Middle East $ 49.63 $ 29.68 Latin America $ 48.26 $ 27.63 Total Worldwide $ 49.04 $ 29.42 NGLs ($/BBL) United States $ 23.07 $ 9.91 Middle East $ 18.64 $ 13.25 Total Worldwide $ 21.59 $ 10.86 Natural Gas ($/MCF) United States $ 2.68 $ 1.50 Latin America $ 4.77 $ 4.19 Total Worldwide $ 2.07 $ 1.25 Three months ended March 31 Average Index Prices 2017 2016 WTI oil ($/BBL) $ 51.91 $ 33.45 Brent oil ($/BBL) $ 54.66 $ 35.08 NYMEX gas ($/MCF) $ 3.26 $ 2.07 Three months ended March 31 Average Realized Prices as Percentage of Average Index Prices 2017 2016 Worldwide oil as a percentage of average WTI 94 % 88 % Worldwide oil as a percentage of average Brent 90 % 84 % Worldwide NGLs as a percentage of average WTI 42 % 32 % Domestic natural gas as a percentage of average NYMEX 82 % 73 %  Worldwide commodity prices for the first quarter of 2017 were higher than the first quarter of 2016. The average quarterly WTI and Brent prices increased to $51.91 per barrel and $54.66 per barrel, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $33.45 per barrel and $35.08 per barrel, respectively, for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide realized crude oil prices increased by 67 percent to $49.04 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $29.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide realized NGLs prices increased by 99 percent to $21.59 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $10.86 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. Domestic realized natural gas prices increased by 79 percent in the first quarter of 2017 to $2.68 per MCF, compared to $1.50 per MCF in the first quarter of 2016.  Occidental's financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products. Significant declines in commodity prices may result in impairments to reduce the carrying value of Occidental's oil and gas properties, while also reducing the amount of volumes that can be produced economically and the quantity and present value of proved reserves.  Chemical Segment  Chemical segment earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were $170 million, compared to $214 million for the same period in 2016. Excluding the 2016 gains of $88 million for the sale of chemical assets, the higher earnings in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reflected significant improvements in caustic soda price and volume. In addition to caustic soda, margin improvements were seen in a majority of core products, despite increases in both ethylene and natural gas costs.  In February, OxyChem and its joint venture partner, Mexichem, began operations of an ethylene cracker in Ingleside, Texas. The project was completed on schedule and on budget. The cracker, which is operated by OxyChem, has the capacity to produce 1.2 billion pounds of ethylene per year and provide OxyChem with an ongoing source of ethylene for manufacturing vinyl chloride monomer, which Mexichem will use to produce polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin and PVC piping systems. The companies have a 20-year supply agreement.  Midstream and Marketing Segment  Midstream and marketing losses were $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with losses of $95 million for the same period 2016. The decrease in midstream and marketing losses reflected higher marketing margins, higher NGLs prices impacting the gas processing business and higher transportation income from the new Ingleside Crude Oil Terminal.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  At March 31, 2017, Occidental had $1.5 billion in cash. Income and cash flows are largely dependent on the oil and gas segment's realized prices, sales volumes and operating costs. With a continued focus on capital efficiency and operational efficiency, Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments, future borrowings, and, if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 billion for both the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Cash flows were positively impacted by higher oil prices in the first three months of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Cash flows in the first quarter of 2016 included $0.6 billion in operating cash flows from discontinued operations related to the Ecuador settlement. The impact of the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is typically less significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because these segments are significantly smaller. The usage of working capital of approximately $380 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly reflected higher receivables that were the result of higher oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2017, compared to the year-end of 2016.  Occidental's net cash used by investing activities was $0.8 billion for the first three months of 2017, compared to $0.6 billion for the same period of 2016. Capital expenditures for the first three months of 2017 were $0.7 billion of which $0.6 billion was for the oil and gas segment, compared to $0.6 billion for the first three months of 2016 of which $0.5 billion was for the oil and gas segment. The change in capital accrual for the first three months of 2017 and 2016 primarily reflected amounts paid in those periods for capital expenditures incurred and accrued in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. The first quarter of 2016 also reflected $0.3 billion of cash received from the sale of assets.  Occidental's net cash used by financing activities was $0.6 billion for the first three months of 2017, compared to net cash used by financing activities of $77 million for the same period of 2016. Cash used by financing activities for the first quarter of 2017 reflected the first quarter dividend payment. Restricted cash of $1.2 billion was used to pay dividends and repay $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes in February of 2016.  As of March 31, 2017, Occidental was in compliance with all covenants of its financing agreements and had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.  Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures  Occidental's operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. Occidental's environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.  The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.  Refer to Note 6, Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and to the Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2016 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Occidental's environmental expenditures.  Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies  Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters. Reserve balances for other matters as of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, were not material to Occidental's consolidated . . .  May 04, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

 

On July 13,
2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board changed the Return on
Equity Incentive (“ROEI”) awards issued in 2008 to Dr.
Ray R. Irani and Stephen I. Chazen to provide for the amounts
payable upon certification of the level of achievement of the
Performance Goal to be settled 50% in cash and 50% in shares,
instead of 100% in cash.  The recipients will retain
shares equivalent to the number of net after-tax shares
received for at least three years.  The form of amendment
to the 2008 ROEI grant agreement is attached as Exhibit
10.1.

 

Additionally,
on July 13, 2011, the Compensation Committee authorized grants of
incentive awards under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive
Plan.  Dr. Irani and Messrs. Chazen, de Brier, Lienert,
Albrecht and Lowe received Total Shareholder Return Incentive
(“TSRI”) awards of a maximum number of performance
shares of 174,809, 194,232, 62,155, 38,847, 62,155 and 62,155,
respectively, and Restricted Stock Incentive awards of 48,558,
48,558, 15,539, 9,712, 15,539 and 15,539 shares,
respectively.  The new grant for Mr. Chazen was increased
from last year’s grant to reflect his new role as Chief
Executive Officer.  The forms of award agreements are
attached as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3.  The forms are
substantially the same as last year’s except that for both
awards, the date of the performance periods have been revised and
for the TSRI, the peer group was modified.

ON EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARD

GRANT
AGREEMENT

 

1.           Section
2 of the Grant Agreement is amended by adding the following after
the end of the paragraph:

 

“
Further,
Grantee shall retain Beneficial Ownership of Shares equal to not
less than 100% of the net after-tax Shares received under this
Agreement until the third anniversary date of the vesting of the
Shares under this Award (the “Beneficial Ownership
Period”). Compliance with the foregoing requirement shall be
determined by reference to the reports filed by the Grantee on
Forms 3, 4, and 5, as applicable, pursuant to Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)
and the aggregate number of Shares reported as Beneficially Owned
during the Beneficial Ownership Period shall be not less than the
sum of the number of Shares then required to be so owned pursuant
to this Grant Agreement and any other Grant Agreement containing
this or a similar requirement.  For purposes of this
Agreement, “Beneficial Ownership” has the meaning
ascribed in Rule 16a-1(2) under the Exchange Act.”

 

 

2.           Section
5 of the Grant Agreement is deleted in its entirety and the
following is substituted in its stead:

 

“1.           
Payment of
Awards.   Up to and including 200% of the
Target Incentive Amount, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 6
of this Agreement, will be settled 50% in cash and 50% in
Shares.  The number of Shares shall be determined by
dividing the amount to be settled in Shares by the last reported
sale price of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transactions on the date the Administrator
certifies attainment of the Performance Goal.  Payment
will be made to the Grantee as promptly as practicable after the
Administrator's certification of the attainment of the Performance
Goal or the Change in Control Event, as the case may be, which, in
the case of payment upon attainment of the Performance Goal, shall
be made no later than the 15 th
day of the
third month following the end of the first taxable year in which
the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture.”

 

 

3.           Section
8 of the Grant Agreement is amended by deleting the second sentence
in its entirety and substituting the following in its
stead:

 

“If the
Company must withhold any tax in connection with granting or
vesting of this Return on Equity Incentive Award, the Grantee by
acknowledging this Agreement agrees that, so long as the Grantee is
an employee of the Company for tax purposes, all or any part of any
such withholding obligation shall be deducted 50% from any cash
amount payable under this Agreement and 50% from the amount to be
paid in Shares by deducting an appropriate number of shares
corresponding to the tax withholding from the number of Shares to
be issued or transferred to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement,
unless the Grantee otherwise instructs the Company in writing not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Performance
Period, to satisfy such tax withholding by deducting a specified
percentage, greater than 50%, from any cash amount payable under
this Agreement and the remaining amount from the Shares portion to
be issued or transferred to the Grantee pursuant to this
Agreement.”

 

4.           Except
as provided herein, all other terms and conditions of the Grant
Agreement remain in full force and effect.

PERFORMANCE
PERIOD:



July 1, 2011
through June 30, 2014




 

 

The following
Terms and Conditions (these “Terms and
Conditions”) are set forth as of the Date of Grant between
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
(“Occidental” and, with its subsidiaries, the
“Company”), and the Eligible Employee receiving this
award (the “Grantee”).

 

1.           
Grant of Performance
Shares .   In accordance with these
Terms and Conditions and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation 2005
Long-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to
time (the “Plan”), Occidental grants to the Grantee as
of the Date of Grant, the right to receive 50% in Shares and 50% in
cash up to the number/value of Performance Shares.  For
the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Performance
Shares” means a bookkeeping entry that records the equivalent
of Shares awarded pursuant to Sections 4.2 and, to the extent
applicable, 5.2 of the Plan that is payable upon the achievement of
the Performance Goal. Performance Shares are not Shares and have no
voting rights or, except as stated in Section 6, dividend
rights.

 

2.           
Restrictions on
Transfer .   (a) Neither these Terms
and Conditions nor any right to receive Shares or cash pursuant to
these Terms and Conditions may be transferred or assigned by the
Grantee other than (i) to a beneficiary designated on a form
approved by the Company (if enforceable under local law), by will
or, if the Grantee dies without designating a beneficiary of a
valid will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii)
pursuant to a domestic relations order, if applicable, (if approved
or ratified by the Committee).

 

 (b) Further,
if the Grantee was a Named Executive Officer during the last
completed fiscal year prior to vesting, then such Grantee shall
retain Beneficial Ownership of Shares equal to not less than 50% of
the net after-tax Shares received under these Terms and Conditions
until the third anniversary date of the vesting of the Shares under
this Award (the “Beneficial Ownership Period”).
Compliance with the foregoing requirement shall be determined by
reference to the reports filed by the Grantee on Forms 3, 4, and 5,
as applicable, pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the aggregate
number of Shares reported as Beneficially Owned during the
Beneficial Ownership Period shall be not less than the sum of the
number of Shares then required to be so owned pursuant to these
Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions of any other
grant containing this or a similar requirement.  For
purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Beneficial
Ownership” has the meaning ascribed in Rule 16a-1(2) under
the Exchange Act and “Named Executive Officer” has the
meaning ascribed thereto pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act.

 

 

1 of 11

 

 

 


 

3.           
Performance
Goal .   The Performance Goal for the
Performance Period is based on Total Shareholder Return (defined as
Total Stockholder Return in the Plan) of the Peer Companies listed
below and the S&P 500 Index, as set forth on Exhibit
1.  Total Shareholder Return shall be calculated for each
Peer Company using the average of its last reported sale price per
share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite
Transactions for the last ten trading days preceding July 1, 2011
and the average of its last reported sale price per share of common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions for
the last ten trading days ending with June 30, 2014.  In
addition to Occidental, the Peer Companies are: Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation, Apache Corporation, Canadian Natural Resources
Limited, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy
Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., ExxonMobil Corporation, Hess
Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, and Total S.A. (collectively,
the “Peer Companies” and individually, a “Peer
Company”); provided however, that consistent with Section
162(m), if at any time during the Performance Period, a Peer
Company is acquired, ceases to exist, ceases to be a
publicly-traded company, files for bankruptcy, spins off 25 percent
or more of its assets, or sells all, or substantially all, of its
assets, then such company will be removed and treated as if it had
never been a Peer Company and the achievement of the Performance
Goal will be determined with respect to the remaining Peer
Companies as set forth on Exhibit 1.

 

4.           
Vesting And Forfeiture of
Performance Shares .    ( a) If the Grantee fails to
accept this award prior to the next record date for the payment of
dividends on the Common Stock subsequent to the Date of Grant,
then, notwithstanding any other provision of this award, the
Grantee shall forfeit all rights under this award and this award
will become null and void.  For purposes of this section,
acceptance of the award shall occur on the date the Grantee accepts
this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award through Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney Benefit Access or any replacement online
system designated by the Company.

 

(b) The Grantee must
remain in the continuous employ of the Company through the last day
of the Performance Period to receive payment of this
award.  The continuous employment of the Grantee will not
be deemed to have been interrupted by reason of the transfer of the
Grantee’s employment among the Company and its affiliates or
an approved leave of absence.  However, if, prior to the
end of the Performance Period, the Grantee dies or becomes
permanently disabled while in the employ of the Company and
terminates as a result thereof, retires with the consent of the
Company, or terminates employment for the convenience of the
Company (each of the foregoing, a “Forfeiture Event”),
then the number of Performance Shares  upon which the
Grantee's award is based will be reduced on a pro rata basis based
upon the number of days remaining in the Performance Period
following the date of the Forfeiture Event.  If the
Grantee terminates employment voluntarily or is terminated for
cause before the end of the Performance Period, then these Terms
and Conditions will terminate automatically on the date of
Grantee’s termination and Grantee shall forfeit the right to
receive any Shares or cash hereunder.

 

(c) The Grantee's
right to receive payment of this award in an amount not to exceed
the Performance Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole share, will
be based on, and become nonforfeitable upon the Committee’s
certification of, the attainment of the Performance
Goal.

 

(d) Notwithstanding
Section 4(c), if a Change in Control event occurs prior to the end
of the Performance Period, the Grantee's right to receive payment
at 50% of the Performance Share level (as adjusted for any
Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(b)) will become
nonforfeitable.  The right to receive Shares and cash in
excess of 50% of the Performance

 

 

2 of 11

 

 

 


 

Share level (as
adjusted for any Forfeiture Event pursuant to Section 4(b)) will be
forfeited.

 

(e) Notwithstanding
Section 4(c), if Occidental’s Total Shareholder Return does
not exceed the Total Shareholder Return of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Stock Index (S&P 500 Index) for the same
period, the Grantee’s right to receive Shares and cash in
excess of 50% of the Performance Share level will be
forfeited.  This comparison shall be calculated using
Occidental’s Total Shareholder Return as defined under
Section 3, and by using the average of the closing S&P 500
Index value for the last ten trading days preceding July 1, 2011
and the average of the closing S&P 500 Index value for the last
ten trading days ending with June 30, 2014 to calculate the Total
Shareholder Return for the S&P 500 Index.

 

5.           
Payment of
Awards .   The Performance Shares as
adjusted pursuant to Sections 4 and 7 of these Terms and Conditions
will be settled 50% in Shares and 50% in cash.  The cash
payment will equal the closing price of the Shares on the New York
Stock Exchange on the date of the Committee’s certification
(the “Certification Date Value”) of the attainment of
the Performance Goal multiplied by 50% of the Performance Shares
earned at the Performance Goal level attained and will be paid as
promptly as practicable after such date.  The Shares
covered by these Terms and Conditions or any prorated portion
thereof shall be issued to the Grantee as promptly as practicable
after the Committee's certification of the attainment of the
Performance Goal or the Change in Control event, as the case may
be.  Each of the cash payment and the Share issuance
shall in any event be made no later than the 15 th
day of the third
month following the end of the first taxable year in which the
award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture.

 

6.           
Crediting and Payment of
Dividend Equivalents .   With respect
to the number of Performance Shares listed above, the Grantee will
be credited on the books and records of Occidental with an amount
(the “Dividend Equivalent”) equal to the amount per
share of any cash dividends declared by the Board on the
outstanding Shares as and when declared with a record date during
the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending with respect
to any portion of the Performance Shares covered by these Terms and
Conditions on the date on which the Committee certifies the
attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event,
as the case may be, or, if earlier, the date on which the Grantee
forfeits the right to receive such portion.  Occidental
will pay in cash to the Grantee an amount equal to the Dividend
Equivalents credited to such Grantee, adjusted, if appropriate, to
reflect the same payment percentage that is used to determine the
payment of the Performance Shares following certification of the
attainment of the Performance Goal or the Change in Control event,
as the case may be, as promptly as may be practicable following
such certification or Change in Control event, but, in any event,
no later than the 15 th
day of the third
month following the end of the first taxable year in which the
award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture.

 

7.           
Adjustments
.   (a) The number of Performance Shares or kind
of shares of stock covered by these Terms and Conditions shall be
adjusted as the Committee determines pursuant to Section 7.2 of the
Plan in order to prevent dilution or expansion of the Grantee's
rights under these Terms and Conditions as a result of events such
as stock dividends, stock splits or other changes in the capital
structure of Occidental, or any merger, consolidation, spin-off,
liquidation or other corporate transaction having a similar
effect.  If any such adjustment occurs, the Company will
give the Grantee written notice of the adjustment.

 

(b) In addition, the
Committee may adjust the Performance Goal or other features of this
Grant as permitted by Section 5.2.3 of the Plan.

 

 

3 of 11

 

 

 


 

8.           
No Employment
Contract .   Nothing in these Terms and
Conditions confers upon the Grantee any right with respect to
continued employment by the Company, nor limits in any manner the
right of the Company to terminate the employment or adjust the
compensation of the Grantee.  Unless otherwise agreed in
a writing signed by the Grantee and an authorized representative of
the Company, the Grantee’s employment with the Company is at
will and may be terminated at any time by the Grantee or the
Company.

 

9.           
Taxes and
Withholding .   Regardless of any
action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax
(including U.S. federal, state and local tax and non-U.S. tax),
social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other
tax-related items related to the Grantee’s participation in
the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (“Tax-Related
Items”), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability
for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the
Company.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the
Company (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the
treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of
this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award, including the grant
or vesting of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award and the
receipt of Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) does not commit to and is
under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any
aspect of the Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award to reduce or
eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the
Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction
between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable
event, the Grantee acknowledges that the Company may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction.

 

Prior to the
relevant taxable event, the Grantee shall pay or make adequate
arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy all Tax-Related
Items.  In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the
Company to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally
payable by the Grantee (A) in connection with the issuance of any
Shares or the payment of cash or any other consideration pursuant
to this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award (other than the
payment of Dividend Equivalents), from any cash and Shares that are
to be paid or issued to the Grantee pursuant to these Terms and
Conditions, in any combination as determined by the Committee at
the time of Certification, or (B) in connection with the granting
of Performance Shares or the payment of Dividend Equivalents
pursuant to this grant of Performance Shares, from the
Grantee’s wages or other cash compensation (including
Dividend Equivalents).  The Grantee shall pay to the
Company any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company may be
required to withhold as a result of the Grantee’s receipt of
this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award that cannot be
satisfied by the means previously described.

 

10.           
Compliance with
Law .   The Company will make
reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable federal, state and
non-U.S. securities laws; however, the Company will not issue any
Shares or other securities pursuant to these Terms and Conditions
if their issuance would result in a violation of any such
law.  However, if it is not feasible for the Company to
comply with such laws with respect to the grant or settlement of
these awards, then the awards may be cancelled without any
compensation or additional benefits provided to Grantee as a result
of the cancellation.

 

11.           
Relation to Other
Benefits .   The benefits received by
the Grantee under these Terms and Conditions will not be taken into
account in determining any benefits to which the Grantee may be
entitled under any profit sharing, retirement or other benefit or
compensation plan maintained by the Company, including the amount
of any life insurance coverage available to any beneficiary of the
Grantee under any life insurance plan covering employees of
the

 

 

4 of 11

 

 

 


 

Company.  Additionally,
the Performance Shares are not part of normal or expected
compensation or salary for any purposes, including, but not limited
to calculation of any severance, resignation, termination,
redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses or long-service
awards.  This grant of Performance Shares does not create
any contractual or other right to receive future grants of
Performance Shares, or benefits in lieu of Performance Shares, even
if Grantee has a history of receiving Performance Shares or other
stock or cash awards.

 

12.           
Amendments
.   The Plan may be modified, amended, suspended
or terminated by the Board at any time, as provided in the
Plan.  Any amendment to the Plan will be deemed to be an
amendment to these Terms and Conditions to the extent it is
applicable to these Terms and Conditions; however, no amendment
will adversely affect the rights of the Grantee under these Terms
and Conditions without the Grantee's consent.

 

13.           
Severability
.   If one or more of the provisions of these
Terms and Conditions is invalidated for any reason by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the invalidated provisions shall be deemed
to be separable from the other provisions of these Terms and
Conditions, and the remaining provisions of these Terms and
Conditions will continue to be valid and fully
enforceable.

 

14.           
Entire
Agreement ;
Relation to Plan;
Interpretation .   Except as
specifically provided in this Section, these Terms and Conditions,
the Exhibit and the Attachments incorporated in these Terms and
Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the Company and
the Grantee with respect to this Total Shareholder Return Incentive
Award.  These Terms and Conditions are subject to the
terms and conditions of the Plan.  In the event of any
inconsistent provisions between these Terms and Conditions and the
Plan, the provisions of the Plan control.  Capitalized
terms used in these Terms and Conditions without definition have
the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.  References to
Sections, Exhibits and Attachments are to Sections and Exhibits of,
and Attachments incorporated in, these Terms and Conditions unless
otherwise noted.

 

15.           
Successors and
Assigns .   Subject to Sections 2 and
4, the provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall be for the
benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors, administrators,
heirs, legal representatives and assigns of the Grantee, and the
successors and assigns of the Company.

 

16.           
Governing Law
.   The laws of the State of Delaware govern the
interpretation, performance, and enforcement of these Terms and
Conditions.

 

17.           
Privacy Rights

Incentive Award, the Grantee explicitly and unambiguously consents
to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form,
of the Grantee’s personal data as described in these Terms
and Conditions by and among, as applicable, the Company and its
affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering
and managing the Grantee’s participation in the
Plan.  The Grantee understands that the Company holds or
may receive from any agent designated by the Company certain
personal information about the Grantee, including, but not limited
to, the Grantee’s name, home address and telephone number,
date of birth, social insurance number or other identification
number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or
directorships held in the Company, details of this Total
Shareholder Return Incentive Award or any other entitlement to
shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or
outstanding in the Grantee’s favor, for the purpose of
implementing, administering and managing the Plan, including

(“Data”).  Data may be transferred

any third parties
assisting in the implementation, administration and management of
the Plan.  These recipients may be located in the
Grantee’s country or elsewhere, and may have different data
privacy laws and protections than the Grantee’s
country.  By accepting these Terms and Conditions, the
Grantee authorizes the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain
and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the
purposes described above.  The Grantee may, at any time,
view Data, request additional information about the storage and

sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to this
Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award granted under the Plan or

participate in the Plan by electronic means.  The Grantee
hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery
and, if requested, to participate in the Plan through an on-line or
electronic system established and maintained by the Company or
another third party designated by the Company.

 

19.           
Grantee’s
Representations and Releases .   By
accepting this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award, the
Grantee acknowledges that the Grantee has read these Terms and
Conditions and understands that (i) the grant of this Total
Shareholder Return Incentive Award is made voluntarily by
Occidental in its discretion with no liability on the part of any
of its direct or indirect subsidiaries and that, if the Grantee is
not an employee of Occidental, the Grantee is not, and will not be
considered, an employee of Occidental but the Grantee is a third
party (employee of a subsidiary) to whom this Total Shareholder
Return Incentive Award is granted; (ii) all decisions with respect
to future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of
Occidental; (iii) the Grantee’s participation in the Plan is
voluntary; (iv) this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award is an
extraordinary item that does not constitute a regular and recurring
item of base compensation; (v) the future value of any Shares
issued pursuant to this Total Shareholder Return Incentive Award
cannot be predicted and Occidental does not assume liability in the
event such Shares have no value in the future; (vi) subject to the
terms of any tax equalization agreement between the Grantee and the
entity employing the Grantee, the Grantee will be solely
