Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space.

Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank.

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream. 



View More



 

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants. 



View More



 

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.

                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

                                or non-qualified retirement plan assets.

Short and Sharp: The twisted relationship between central banks and inflation

Investors currently face the challenge of the Federal Reserve’s belief that monetary policy needs to be tightened, despite missing inflationary pressures. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it’s a global one. In the euro-area, core inflation remains stubbornly low, yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely gearing up to announce its tapering plans.

Back to Litigation Tracker







SummaryDocumentsCommentsBlog Entries


 A shareholder in the Principal Funds initiated a lawsuit against the Funds’ adviser (Principal Management Corporation) and distributor (Principal Funds Distributor). The Complaint seeks to rescind the investment advisory agreements and distribution plans and recover fees charges by the defendants. The Complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the Funds by using multiple layers of advisory fees that the plaintiff believes are excessive. The Complaint also alleges that Rule 12b-1 fees for sales and distribution activities are also excessive. This case was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. On June 8, 2010, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. The case may proceed on the counts of excessive advisory fees and excessive distribution fees. On October 28, 2011, the plaintiff filed a new complaint with the Court. Motions for Summary Judgment were filed by both parties in February and March of 2013. In June 2013, the case was settled and a stipulation of dismissal was filed with the Court by the parties.  The terms of settlement were not disclosed.  




  
 Order of Dismissal with Prejudice 
 On June 12, 2013, the Court issued an Order accepting a confidential settlement of the case, through a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice by the parties.

 Defendants File Motion for Summary Judgment 
 On March 19, 2013, the defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.  The Motion states that the plaintiffs cannot establish any genuine disputed issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.  The defendants allege that the plaintiffs cannot establish that the fees paid by the SAM Funds were so disproprtionately large that they bore no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length barganing.

 Plaintiffs File Motion for Partial Summary Judgment 
 On February 22, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on one issue in this litigation.  The issue involves whether the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits recovery of damages to those incurred during the period one year before the lawsuit was filed.  The plaintiffs believe that the plain language of Section 36(b)(3) of the Investment Company Act only prohibits the recovery of damages that are incurred prior to one year before a lawsuit is initiated.  Thus, the plaintiffs argue that the Act permits the recovery of damages from one year prior to the filing of a complaint and continuing through the date of trial.

 Plaintiff Files Second Anniversary Complaint  
 On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a new complaint on the two year anniversary of the filing of the original case.

 Court Decides to Grant In Part and Deny In Part the Motion to Dismiss  
 On June 8, 2010, the Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in part. In its decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiff’s allegation regarding the existence of excess profits from economies of scale, but permitted the case to continue regarding the allegations of excessive layers of advisory fees and the charging of excessive distribution fees. The Court stated that the plaintiffs’ allegations all support a reasonable inference that the investment adviser collected excessive fees for advising the Principal Funds. The Court also stated that the plaintiffs have met their burden by alleging that fees collected by the distributor for its distribution services surpassed the value of those services, and the manner in which those fees were assessed did not correspond to the type of services performed but, rather, resemble fees collected for advisory services.

 Defendants File Motion to Dismiss the Case 
 On January 29, 2010, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. In their Motion, the defendants argued that the fees charged met the Gartenberg standard of not being “so disproportionately large that it bears no relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm’s length bargaining.”

 Shareholders File Amended Complaint on Behalf of the Principal Funds 
 On January 15, 2010, two shareholders filed an Amended Complaint on behalf of the Principal Funds and against the Funds’ investment adviser and distributor.

The Motion states that the plaintiffs cannot establish any genuine disputed issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.  The defendants allege that the plaintiffs cannot establish that the fees paid by the SAM Funds were so disproprtionately large that they bore no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length barganing.

Document Title: 


                    Plaintiffs File Motion for Partial Summary Judgment        



Document Desc: 


                    On February 22, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on one issue in this litigation.  The issue involves whether the Investment Company Act of 1940 limits recovery of damages to those incurred during the period one year before the lawsuit was filed.  The plaintiffs believe that the plain language of Section 36(b)(3) of the Investment Company Act only prohibits the recovery of damages that are incurred prior to one year before a lawsuit is initiated.  Thus, the plaintiffs argue that the Act permits the recovery of damages from one year prior to the filing of a complaint and continuing through the date of trial.

Document Desc: 


                    On June 8, 2010, the Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in part. In its decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiff’s allegation regarding the existence of excess profits from economies of scale, but permitted the case to continue regarding the allegations of excessive layers of advisory fees and the charging of excessive distribution fees. The Court stated that the plaintiffs’ allegations all support a reasonable inference that the investment adviser collected excessive fees for advising the Principal Funds. The Court also stated that the plaintiffs have met their burden by alleging that fees collected by the distributor for its distribution services surpassed the value of those services, and the manner in which those fees were assessed did not correspond to the type of services performed but, rather, resemble fees collected for advisory services.

Document Desc: 


                    On January 29, 2010, the defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. In their Motion, the defendants argued that the fees charged met the Gartenberg standard of not being “so disproportionately large that it bears no relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm’s length bargaining.”

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream. 



View More



 

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants. 



View More



 

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

How can I find an HOA management company?

Please keep in mind that selecting a firm is a long term decision and changeover costs can be high, so make sure you review candidates thoroughly before making a final decision.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions.
