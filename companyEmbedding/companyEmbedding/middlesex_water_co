Water Quality
Middlesex Water Company has a stringent water quality monitoring and testing program to ensure drinking water that meets and consistently exceeds state and federal water quality standards. The Company provides information on its water quality results to customers through Annual Water Quality Reports to customers.
To view our latest water quality report, please click here.
To view the Bayview System water quality report, please click here.

Middlesex System
Retail Customers
The Middlesex System in New Jersey provides water services to approximately 60,000 retail customers, primarily in eastern Middlesex County, New Jersey. Areas served on a retail basis include: The Township of Woodbridge, the Boroughs of Carteret and Metuchen, portions of the Township of Edison and the Borough of South Plainfield and a small portion of the Township of Clark in Union County. These retail customers include a mix of residential customers, large industrial concerns, commercial and light industrial facilities.
Contract Customers
The Middlesex System also provides water under wholesale contracts to the City of Rahway, the Townships of Edison and Marlboro, the Boroughs of Highland Park and Sayreville and the Old Bridge Municipal Utilities Authority. Water treatment and pumping services are provided to the Township of East Brunswick under contract. Contract customers of the Middlesex System comprise an area of about 146 square miles with a population of approximately 300,000.  Contracts sales to Edison, Sayreville, Old Bridge, Marlboro and Rahway are supplemental to the existing water systems of these customers.
The Middlesex system utilizes both surface and groundwater supplies during various times of the year and customers may receive either or a blend of both sources depending upon location and demands. Surface water is obtained from the Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R Canal), which is owned by the State of New Jersey and operated by the New Jersey Water Supply Authority. Surface water sources provide approximately 74 percent of the Middlesex system's supply.  Groundwater sources provide approximately 19% of supply from 31 wells and the balance (7 percent) is purchased water from a non-affiliated water utility.
The Company obtains groundwater from its Wellfields in South Plainfield in North and South Edison. Groundwater comes from an underground source of water known as the Brunswick Aquifer. Middlesex Water's rates are regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. The Company is also subject to various Federal and State regulatory agencies concerning water quality standards.
Bayview System
Middlesex Water provides water service to approximately 300 customers in Cumberland County, NJ. This system is not physically interconnected with the Middlesex System. Water supply to Bayview system customers is derived solely from groundwater from an artesian aquifer known as the Lower Kirkwood Formation.

Real Homeowners Real Stories
 
Calvetta Williams, a 41-year old single mother of three, found out that she had a leak in her water service line just three months after moving into her home in Des Moines, Iowa. The leak was discovered by the local water company, Des Moines Water Works, who sent a crew to the neighborhood to check the water connections before the city began curb work. The water line had a break between the street and the meter at Williams' house, and was pouring water into the ground.

Ms. Williams, who owns an in-home child care business for several families in the community, was unprepared to pay thousands of dollars to fix the leak. In April 2013, she was presented with a $6,700 bill for the repairs, followed by a threat from the city that the leak needed to be fixed by May 6 or the water to her home and business would be shut off.

Water service line repairs in the Des Moines area cost between $3,000-$8,000, according to Des Moines Water Works. HomeServe provides home emergency repair contracts that cost as little as $4* per month to cover water line breaks. The company learned of Ms. Williams's situation via a story in the local newspaper. Wanting to give back to the woman who has done so much for her local community, HomeServe repaired her water line free of charge, keeping her home and business running.

Exterior Water Service Line Information
 


Your exterior water service line is the underground pipe that carries water from the main connection, located near the street, to the foundation of your home. Over time, environmental conditions and aging can break down sections of pipe, causing deterioration and cracks. As the homeowner, it’s likely your responsibility for repairing any damage to the water service line that’s on your property.

What is an exterior water service line?

Water mains are the pipes delivering the water supply throughout most towns. This network of pipes is usually installed below the town’s streets. A water service line is what connects your home with the water main.  

Most homeowners have a water service line that stems from the water main beneath the street. From there, it extends below the front yard and runs into your home at the point of the foundation. Once your water service line reaches the inside of your house, it’s referred to as a “water distribution pipe.”

Usually your water service line is ¾” to 2″ in diameter and rests at a depth determined by the building code in your community. Gaining access to the buried water service line makes repairs and replacement of the pipe difficult. The job often involves heavy machinery such as a backhoe and industrial grade pipe cutters and the cost of the machinery plus the materials for the repairs can be over $2,000. 1

Common Symptoms of a Water Service Line Problem
It is easy to ignore a problem that is literally buried underground. Even when aged water and sewer mains in cities and towns are replaced, the lines that connect a private home to the public mains will continue to age, representing an increased risk to the homeowner.

Some symptoms are more visible than others. These are some indicators that your home might have a potential water service line failure

 Visible water leak
High water bill
Damp areas in yard, lush section of grass
Damp sidewalk or driveway
Sunken or eroded areas of ground
Water leaking into basement or crawlspace
Low water pressureDirt/sand coming out of fixtures

Causes of Damage to a Water Service Line

According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, water mains are aging rapidly and pose one of the most serious challenges to our nation’s infrastructure. Water infrastructure continues to deteriorate and it will take tremendous time and investment to revitalize the amount of infrastructure that requires fixing today. With this in mind, homeowners should understand the consequences of failing water and sewer infrastructure has on them and their community and what they can do to stay safe, secure, and avoid financial surprises in the meantime.

Common causes of an exterior water service line failure:

Aging of pipes
Corrosion
Expansion and contraction due to temperature changes
Freezing due to extreme cold
Tree roots
Ground settling
Rocky soil pushing or settling on a pipe
Pressure

Solutions for Repairing a Water Service Line

The number of burst pipes in the front yard of American homeowners will likely climb higher as existing pipes age - and often it is those who are least able to afford it who will struggle to pay the price.  Service repair plan providers give homeowners a way to protect themselves.

Homeowners and their families need to know that water infrastructure is a crucial part of their daily lives and a significant threat to their individual safety and finances.  The increasing risks of burst water and waste pipes on a homeowner’s property are very real and can be managed while our country focuses our infrastructure for the future.

With a repair plan from HomeServe, you can get protection from the high cost of repairs. If your water service line leaks or breaks, we can repair or replace the line on your property using the following methods:

Spot repair – replace a fitting or coupling due to a single isolated leak.
Section repair – replace a larger section of the water service line.
Re-route a section or all of the water service line around an obstacle.
Bore a section or all of the water service line to minimize disturbance to surface obstacles (concrete, landscaping, structures).Replace the entire water service line by digging an open trench.

Homeowner Responsibility

One of the most common misconceptions regarding water infrastructure is that the utility provider or the government will take care of the problem if there is a leak on private property. Unfortunately, while local utilities and municipalities foot the bill for repairs to much of our declining infrastructure on city/state property, the homeowner is primarily responsible for the service line that brings fresh water to their home as well as the sewer/septic line on their property.

The majority of basic homeowners insurance policies also do not cover repair or replacement of the water service lines on your property. And, most home inspectors are not required to check the condition of your exterior water systems when you purchase your home.

Does Your Homeowners Insurance Cover Exterior Water or Sewer Line Breaks?
Buying or building a home is one of the biggest investments a family will make and homeowners insure their homes to protect from unanticipated home emergencies.  However, many homeowners don’t know where their insurance plan ends and their liabilities begin. They are often surprised to find out they are typically responsible for repairs to the pipes and wires in and around their home.

See the chart below to find out if your basic insurance policy covers water or sewer/septic line breaks.

Water Service Line Quick Facts

 An exterior water service line is the pipe that originates from the water main beneath the street and travels into your foundation, providing the water supply for your home.
Typically, older water service lines are made of cast iron or galvanized steel, while most water service lines installed after 1980 are PVC or copper.
While only two inches in diameter, water service lines deliver water to your home at high pressure, often 300 psi or more.
The depth at which your water service line is buried on your property is commonly determined by local building codes or ordinances. Usually your water line is set below the average frost line to ensure it doesn’t freeze during the winter.
Settling of the ground around the water service line, calcification, mineralization due to hard water, rust, seasonal changes, kinking, and pitting are just a few examples of the types of damage that cause water service lines to fail.
It is estimated that 1,100,000 homeowners will suffer a water service line emergency in 2014.1

America's Infrastructure
 
An abstract national issue or a real threat to homeowners?

America’s infrastructure – roads, bridges, and water and wastewater systems – are an integral part of what made our nation great. As recently as 2006, America’s infrastructure ranked in the top ten for overall quality. Today, we are ranked 25th, below many of our biggest trading partners and even some developing nations.

How did our infrastructure – the backbone of a modern economy and lifestyle – become so fragile? Infrastructure is complicated and expensive, but the truth is that America has not been vigilant about the shared burden of infrastructure upkeep. Our bridges and water mains are getting older, and instead of investing to keep them updated, we collectively hope the structures serving us will keep working.

The decay of America’s critical infrastructure isn’t new, but there is a crucial untold story that American families need to hear today. Infrastructure can be a big, abstract concept, despite the fact that we use it every day, but failing water and wastewater systems, including the piping that connects these municipal systems to the home, can quickly become a very real threat to individual homeowners.

HomeServe aims to bring a focus to the impact that deteriorating water and wastewater systems are having today on municipalities around the country, and also the hidden danger facing individual American families with the infrastructure serving their homes. The bottom line is that American homeowners should take steps today to prepare themselves and protect their families, homes, and finances from the costs and damages of water infrastructure-related home emergencies.
