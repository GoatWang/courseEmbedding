1920

A LEGEND IS BORN
The Smith's story begins in 1920, when Smith's Crisps Ltd is founded by Frank Smith in the UK. In 1931, the first Australian made Smith's Crisps were manufactured by Frank Smith and George Ensor. 














1950s

NIBBLE NOBBY'S NUTS!
Nobby's Nuts were founded in the 1950s by Max 'Nobby' Noblet, who started Nobbys as a one-man business, manufacturing and selling nuts .















1961

AUSTRALIA'S FIRST  FLAVOURED CRISP
The original and the best potato chips delighted Aussie consumers with the introduction of the first flavoured chip – chicken in 1961. 




















1964

TWISTIES JOINS  THE FAMILY
Who would have thought Twisties would become the Aussie snack icon it is today when the brand was purchased back in 1964? We all know life's pretty straight without Twisties!















1974

BURGER RINGS BITE !
Aussie tastebuds were delivered another snacking sensation in 1974 with the launch of the unique  burger taste that  is  Burger Rings 




















1983

DORITOS COMES  TO AUSTRALIA
When Herman Cortez conquered Mexico in 1521, he captured the vast wealth of Aztec gold, and also introduced the world to the perfect snack – the tortilla. Doritos are tortilla corn chips. These "little bits of gold" ("Doritos" translated from Spanish) arrived in Australia in 1983.













1987

CHIPPIE , CHIPPIE , CHIPPIE
Travelling from the planet Dok, the infamous Gobbledok began his search for the original and the best potato chip, Smith's, in 1987. Reflecting his absolute delight for Smith's, he was often heard to scream "Chippie, chippie, chippies" as he raced away with packs of Smith's to take back home!










1996

PARKER'S  PRETZELS  INCREASE  AUSSIE  SNACK  CHOICES
Legend has it pretzels were developed by an unknown French monk who fashioned the design (symbolic of arms folded in prayer) from left over dough. A baker fell asleep while they were baking and the "hard" pretzel was created.










2005

SA..KA..TA THE AUSTRALIAN  MADE RICE CRACKER  
Sakata originated in Japan where two brothers developed the delicious usu-yaki rice cracker. 
      Sakata, the iconic Australian made rice cracker, has one of the most loved jingles in Aussie history and joined the family in 2005.

















2009

SUNBITES GRAINWAVES WHOLEGRAIN SNACK INTRODUCED
In 2009 Sunbites Grain Waves, the delicious snack made with the goodness of wholegrain, were introduced to Aussies across the nation. Seasoned with natural colours and flavours, Sunbites Grain Waves quickly became Australia's favourite wholegrain chip!



















2014

SUNBITES POPCORN - SNACKS YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT 
Bursting on to the market in 2014, came Sunbites Popcorn, made with the goodness of tasty wholegrain corn kernels, cooked in hot air not oil, and then lightly seasoned. The result was a  truly scrumptious popcorn that also happens to be 25% lower in fat and salt than oil popped popcorn.





















2015

SMITH'S 'FOR ALL FANS'  CAMPAIGN
There is nothing more Aussie than coming together around sport and at Smith’s we are ‘For all Fans’!
                The Smith’s “For All Fans” campaign held up a mirror to the nation and celebrated the unsung heroes of sport – the fans. In doing so, it aimed to remind the nation that sport just isn’t sport without your mates and your Smith’s.
              






















2016

SMITH'S BRAND REFRESH 2016 
Smith’s has launched a fresh new look for our packaging across both Smith’s Crinkle and Smith’s Thinly Cut chips ranges, in all pack formats, along with a modernisation of the Smith’s logo itself. Since first produced in Australia back in 1931, the Smith’s logo has had a number of gradual changes, to ensure the brand has evolved with the times.  The new logo has a more dynamic and contemporary feel, with the main change being the red Smith's banner breaking out of diamond and wrapping around it to create a more 3D effect.

The Smith's Snackfood Company is a British-Australian manufacturing company best known for its potato crisps. It is owned by the American multinational corporation, PepsiCo. The company produces and markets various snack foods.[1] Smith's Snackvend Stand is the branch of the company that operates vending machines.[2]

Smiths by country[edit]
United Kingdom[edit]
Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd. was formed by Frank Smith and Jim Viney in the United Kingdom after World War I. The firm started in Cricklewood, London, reputedly in Smith's garage. In 1927, after buying Jim Viney's share of the business, the company expanded into a factory in Brentford, London, which was enlarged in 1930. During the depression, Smith travelled to Australia to expand the business. The company nearly went under during this time and had to be propped back up by a small number of visitors and investors. The company bounced back and expanded its brands, aided with the help of advancing technology.[3] Smiths was later owned by biscuit company Nabisco, BSN and finally sold to American company PepsiCo in the 1990s. Subsequently, Pepsico withdrew the brand, in favour of popular British brand Walkers, which had been heavily marketed in a campaign using ex-footballer turned television presenter Gary Lineker. Many of the products previously owned by Smith's became labelled as Walkers, although there are still several Smith's branded crisps sold by Walkers, mainly ones sold at a budget price such as Snaps (originally sold by Walkers), Wafflers and Twisted.
Australia[edit]
After establishing the product and name in the UK, Frank Smith moved to Australia to set up the business there.[4] Smith's Crisps were first manufactured in Australia in 1931 with an associate, George Ensor, in leased premises in Sydney's Surry Hills. They were originally made in 20 gas fired cooking pots, then packed by hand and distributed by Nestle confectionery vans.[5]
Smith's Potato Crisps sold its early crisps in three penny packets, 24 to a tin. "Twist of salt" sachets were included before pre-salting had been introduced. In March 1932, Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd. went into voluntary liquidation as a result of the Great Depression. However, three months later, George Ensor tendered for the business put up for sale by the liquidators, and on 13 May 1932, Smith's Potato Crisps (Australia) was formed with the UK Smith's Company holding a majority interest over minor shareholders. Growth after World War II was rapid, so a continuous cooker process was introduced to replace the individual cooking pots and in 1960 the production of a one shilling pack for cinemas and a box pack for four shillings was initiated. In 1961, Smith's introduced its first flavoured crisp - chicken. It was a very popular flavour, influencing most competitors at the time to adopt a Chicken variation. Other flavours released were Original (Pre-Salted) and Salt & Vinegar. Later, in the 1970s, Barbecue was added as a flavour for Smiths crinkle cut crisps, and in the 1980s Cheese & Onion was added. These five flavours - Original Salted (blue packet), Salt & Vinegar (magenta packet), Chicken (green packet), Barbecue (orange packet) and Cheese & Onion (yellow packet) have remained the mainstay flavours of the brand since the 1980s. Many other 'limited edition' variants have also been tried over the years.
Seven years later, Associated Products and Distribution Pty Ltd (APD), partnered with PepsiCo beverages Ltd, which had built up a significant snack food company that sold chips and nuts and bought a 41.5% share of Smith's Potato Crisps (Australia)'s parent company. Over the next 20 years, other takeovers and new products (including Twisties and Burger Rings brands) drove growth. PepsiCo took over the company in 1998. In 1990, the APD name was replaced by CCA Snackfoods.
In 1998, the Smiths Snackfood company was Australia's largest producer of salty snack foods. It was acquired in August of that year, by Frito-Lay the second largest producer of salt snack foods in Australia, which is owned by PepsiCo. To prevent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) from intervening for unfair trading practices Frito-Lay divested a range of brands, manufacturing facilities, including plants in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. The package was named Snack Brands Australia and was sold to Dollar Sweets Holdings. In that package included the brands sold were CC's, Cheezels, Thins and Samboy.
Despite Australians using the term "chips" for crisps, Smith's called their product crisps until as late as 2003. They are now labelled as Smith's Chips.[6] As of 2010-2011, portions contained in "large" bags of Smith's Snackfood products have diminished, down from 200g to 175g.[7]

Smiths by country[edit]
United Kingdom[edit]
Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd. was formed by Frank Smith and Jim Viney in the United Kingdom after World War I. The firm started in Cricklewood, London, reputedly in Smith's garage. In 1927, after buying Jim Viney's share of the business, the company expanded into a factory in Brentford, London, which was enlarged in 1930. During the depression, Smith travelled to Australia to expand the business. The company nearly went under during this time and had to be propped back up by a small number of visitors and investors. The company bounced back and expanded its brands, aided with the help of advancing technology.[3] Smiths was later owned by biscuit company Nabisco, BSN and finally sold to American company PepsiCo in the 1990s. Subsequently, Pepsico withdrew the brand, in favour of popular British brand Walkers, which had been heavily marketed in a campaign using ex-footballer turned television presenter Gary Lineker. Many of the products previously owned by Smith's became labelled as Walkers, although there are still several Smith's branded crisps sold by Walkers, mainly ones sold at a budget price such as Snaps (originally sold by Walkers), Wafflers and Twisted.
Australia[edit]
After establishing the product and name in the UK, Frank Smith moved to Australia to set up the business there.[4] Smith's Crisps were first manufactured in Australia in 1931 with an associate, George Ensor, in leased premises in Sydney's Surry Hills. They were originally made in 20 gas fired cooking pots, then packed by hand and distributed by Nestle confectionery vans.[5]
Smith's Potato Crisps sold its early crisps in three penny packets, 24 to a tin. "Twist of salt" sachets were included before pre-salting had been introduced. In March 1932, Smith's Potato Crisps Ltd. went into voluntary liquidation as a result of the Great Depression. However, three months later, George Ensor tendered for the business put up for sale by the liquidators, and on 13 May 1932, Smith's Potato Crisps (Australia) was formed with the UK Smith's Company holding a majority interest over minor shareholders. Growth after World War II was rapid, so a continuous cooker process was introduced to replace the individual cooking pots and in 1960 the production of a one shilling pack for cinemas and a box pack for four shillings was initiated. In 1961, Smith's introduced its first flavoured crisp - chicken. It was a very popular flavour, influencing most competitors at the time to adopt a Chicken variation. Other flavours released were Original (Pre-Salted) and Salt & Vinegar. Later, in the 1970s, Barbecue was added as a flavour for Smiths crinkle cut crisps, and in the 1980s Cheese & Onion was added. These five flavours - Original Salted (blue packet), Salt & Vinegar (magenta packet), Chicken (green packet), Barbecue (orange packet) and Cheese & Onion (yellow packet) have remained the mainstay flavours of the brand since the 1980s. Many other 'limited edition' variants have also been tried over the years.
Seven years later, Associated Products and Distribution Pty Ltd (APD), partnered with PepsiCo beverages Ltd, which had built up a significant snack food company that sold chips and nuts and bought a 41.5% share of Smith's Potato Crisps (Australia)'s parent company. Over the next 20 years, other takeovers and new products (including Twisties and Burger Rings brands) drove growth. PepsiCo took over the company in 1998. In 1990, the APD name was replaced by CCA Snackfoods.
In 1998, the Smiths Snackfood company was Australia's largest producer of salty snack foods. It was acquired in August of that year, by Frito-Lay the second largest producer of salt snack foods in Australia, which is owned by PepsiCo. To prevent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) from intervening for unfair trading practices Frito-Lay divested a range of brands, manufacturing facilities, including plants in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. The package was named Snack Brands Australia and was sold to Dollar Sweets Holdings. In that package included the brands sold were CC's, Cheezels, Thins and Samboy.
Despite Australians using the term "chips" for crisps, Smith's called their product crisps until as late as 2003. They are now labelled as Smith's Chips.[6] As of 2010-2011, portions contained in "large" bags of Smith's Snackfood products have diminished, down from 200g to 175g.[7]
