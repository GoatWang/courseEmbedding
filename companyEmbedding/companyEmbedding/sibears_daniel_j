Daniel J. Rice III step down from his money-spinning position with BlackRock Inc. five years back due to pressure from the board of directors for running a parallel business with his sons under the name of Rice Energy Inc. But no one thought that the decision would be so profitable for him in today’s time where that business got sold for $6.7 billion to EQT Corp. After the takeover announcement on Monday, EQT Corp Inc. becomes the largest natural gas producing firm in the US exceeding to Exxon Mobil Corp. Daniel Rice III seems to be very happy with the performance of all three sons who are currently the executives of the company.
According to the deal, they would receive $1 billion as a share of a deal for their family’s stake in the Rice energy Inc. Shale production is in high demand in the US and this future prediction of Mr. Rice a decade ago benefited him in the long run. He risked his high profile position and money to enter the shale production sector and sowed the seed of Rice Energy Inc. with the help of his three sons. Daniel J. Rice IV, 36, Toby, 35, and Derek, 32 contributed and supported the dream of Mr. Rice and got that dream come true by converting it into a billion dollar company. Separation from BlackRock Inc. didn’t harm Mr. Rice professionally or financially and proved to be a good decision in his favour. But it didn’t work well for BlackRock Inc. for $12 million. Because they were fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for not informing or disclosing Rice’s participation in Rice Energy Inc.
But it was too late to catch hold of Rice because he already was on the verge of becoming a billionaire and got his company listed on the stock exchange in January 2014. Rice Energy Inc’s addition to the EQT Corp Inc is going to set the foot print for the company to enhance their skill sets to explore their opportunities to get much ahead of other competitors in the production of shale gas. Their aggressive approach helped them to get deeper to 1 billion cubic feet production of shale gas on a daily basis. They were the first one to utilize high end technology and big data analytics to predict the demand and supply of the shale gas which ensured they always stayed ahead of their competitors in the race.

Because of this, it is recommended that all children, including those with no symptoms, have a comprehensive eye examination by the age of three and sooner if there is a family history of any eye condition or disease. If you suspect a problem, or need to set up your child’s first eye examination, contact Tulman Eye Group to set up an appointment.GlaucomaOften called “the silent thief of sight,” glaucoma is an increase in the intraocular pressure of the eyes, which causes damage to the optic nerve with no signs or symptoms in the early stages of the disease. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to a decrease in peripheral vision and eventually blindness.OphthalmologyMacular DegenerationMacular degeneration is a chronic, progressive disease that gradually destroys sharp central vision due to a deterioration of the macula, a tiny spot in the central portion of your retina comprised of millions of light-sensing cells. Because it is so commonly associated with aging, it is also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). There are two forms of AMD called “dry,” most common and with no known treatment, and “wet,” less common and treated with laser procedures. Genetic testing is now available to help identify those most likely to develop “wet” macular degeneration.Laser Eye SurgeryIn reality, most people have some degree of astigmatism, which is usually present at birth and is believed to be hereditary. In minor cases, treatment may not be required but is certainly beneficial. Moderate to severe astigmatism can be treated with corrective eyewear or LASIK surgery.CataractsA cataract is a clouding of the eye’s normally clear lens, which leads to a progressive blurring or dimming of vision. It is the world’s leading cause of blindness and among the most common conditions related to aging – by age 65, you have a 50 percent chance of developing a cataract, and, by age 75, it jumps to 70 percent.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyDiabetic eye disease is a general term for a group of eye problems that can result from having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma.General PractitionersPediatric CareDr. Pamela Shepard grew up in Collinsville, Alabama.

She also was a member of SVOSH, a volunteer organization that served the needs of underprivileged patients in the United States and abroad. While a student at UAB, Dr. Shepard completed rotations at Veteran’s Affairs hospitals and an ophthalmology practice that specialized in refractive surgery. She also received extensive training in primary care, pediatrics, and contact lens fittings.Primary CareUpon completion of her residency, Dr. Shepard began working full time at Tulman Eye Group. She is an active member of the American Optometric Association and the Georgia Optometric Association.
