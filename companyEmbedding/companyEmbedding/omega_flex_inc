Product 
        Specifications > Specification 
        Chart Headings
 Select from the Product list at left 
        to see Specifications for Particular Products.
 Hose Nominal Size 
The nominal inside 
        diameter of the hose. 
Number 
        of Braid Layers 
        Indicated the number of braid layers required to achieve the pressure 
        ratings listed.
 Nominal 
        Outside Diameter
        Nominal outside diameter of the hose or the hose and indicated number 
        of braid layers. This column is usually used to determine the proper braid 
        sleeve/ferrule or the cover dimensions.
 Minimum 
        Centerline Bend Radius
        The hose may be bent to a radius not less than the indicated amount without 
        permanent deformation. The type of flexing can be static or dynamic. Hose 
        in a static bend is in a non-moving application. The dynamic application 
        allows for random or intermittent flexing.
 Pressure 
        Ratings
        Pressure ratings are shown in three categories: 

Maximum Rated 
          Working pressure is the maximum pressure the hose should be subjected 
          to on a continuous basis. 
Maximum Rated 
          Test pressure is the maximum amount of pressure the hose can be 
          subjected to during testing without possible deformation of the hose 
          corrugations. 
 Nominal Rated 
          Burst pressure is the pressure at which the hose assembly can be 
          expected to fail.

 Safety Factor 
        of 4:1 is maintained by OmegaFlex on all published pressures. 
        Published pressures are shown in psig at 70°F. Reduction of pressure 
        ratings should be used by the proper application of temperature correction 
        factors. See Temperature 
        Correction Factors for more information.

Kevin R. Hoben, President and CEO, announced that the Company's Net Sales for the first six months of 2017 were 11.1% higher than last year, increasing to $49,412,000 from $44,466,000 for the periods ending June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Net Sales for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were largely consistent with the second quarter of 2016.  Net Sales for the second quarter of 2017 were diminished primarily by an increase in customer promotional incentives.   
The Company's Net Income for the first six months of 2017 was $7,172,000, compared to $6,356,000 during the same period last year, increasing 12.8%.  For the quarter, Net Income was however 18.3% below last year.  The Company incurred higher raw material costs in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, which have been addressed though our own pricing actions to offset the imbalance.  There were also additional expenses accrued related to the Company's phantom stock plan, resulting primarily from the recent increase in the Company's stock price.

Omega Flex, Inc. Announces Intention to Launch New Product
New Changes to Health Care Facilities Code Paves Way for Commercialization of MediTrac® Corrugated Medical Gas Tubing



















June 12, 2017 16:30 ET

 | Source: Omega Flex, Inc.






MIDDLETOWN, Conn., June  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Omega Flex, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:OFLX) today announced that the National Fire Protection Association has adopted revisions to the Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99) to permit the use of corrugated medical gas tubing (“CMT”) to convey medical gases in health care facilities in the United States.  These changes to NFPA 99 will become effective in January 2018.  OmegaFlex is working to qualify its CMT product, MediTrac®, to demonstrate compliance with the new NFPA 99 requirements, with product commercialization expected in 2018.  This news release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to inherent uncertainties which are difficult to predict, and may be beyond the ability of our control. Certain statements in this news release constitute forward-looking statements with the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform act of 1995, that are not historical facts but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events.  The words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “hopes,” “likely,” “will,” and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) or industry results, to differ materially from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which reflect management’s view only as of the date of this news release.  We undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, conditions or circumstances.Contact:

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.
