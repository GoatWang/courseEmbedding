Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

                                            GEICO needs in depth review by AG's nationwide. Highly recommend that you shop around and take time to review each company. GEICO will let you down 100% You work hard for your money, Invest your time to find a real insurance company. Good luck.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Pembroke Management Ltd. is a privately held Canadian investment management firm that manages investment portfolios and separately managed accounts for Canadian pension funds, foundations, endowments, wealthy families and individuals, in addition to the GBC family of mutual funds.[1] Since Pembroke's founding in 1968, the portfolio management team has applied fundamental analysis and conducted ongoing executive level interviews in order to identify high quality companies with compelling growth prospects, unrecognized intrinsic value and strong entrepreneurial leadership.





This article appears to contain a large number of buzzwords. There might be a discussion about this on the talk page. Please help improve this article if you can. (July 2017)


Pembroke has offices in Montreal and Toronto.[1]
History[edit]

1968 - Pembroke Management Ltd. was founded[2] in September by Neil B. Ivory, Clifford L. Larock, A. Scott Taylor and Ian A. Soutar[3][4] to manage some of the funds previously managed by Arbuckle Govett. The firm’s name is a reference to Pembroke College, Cambridge.
1970 - The Pembroke Fund Ltd. was launched.
1988 - GBC North America converted from a closed end fund to a mutual fund. Ivory & Sime Pembroke was formed by Pembroke Management and Ivory & Sime PLC. to market the GBC family of mutual funds in Canada and the UK. The funds were launched on November 1.
