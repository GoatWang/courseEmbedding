      Commercial Case Studies    

Commercial Success
Achieving your business goals through informed design
“It’s not about the building. It’s about what the building enables you to do.” Spend any amount of time with the employees (we call them “archistructors”) at Neenan, and you’ll hear that phrase come up in conversation. The unwavering belief that our primary job is to help you achieve your business outcomes is built into the Neenan DNA. Before we begin work on a project – whether it’s a small tenant finish, a large conference center or manufacturing facility , or anything in between – you establish the guiding principles that will steer the plan from rough sketches to ribbon cutting. These Conditions of Satisfaction define the business outcomes you want to achieve; we design the Archistructure® to help your reach them. Your business is distinctive. Your aspirations are unique. Your building shouldn’t just reflect your goals – it should realize them.
