Purser Tax of Mercer Island
I owe the IRS $45,000 and found these people on the internet. I am extremely glad that I selected them. It's been several years since I had filed a tax return and did all of that for my part. I donÂt have to worry about the IRS any longer and now I've got the relief I was looking for. I never would have been able to do this by myself. I had no idea where to even begin. They are a true blessing to me and my family.
