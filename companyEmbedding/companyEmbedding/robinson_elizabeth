Three Novels revisits the terrain of the Victorian novel, entering that world with a particular affinity for the feminine within its social and physical landscape. Taking cues from three different novels, these poems show the intimacies that make “adhesive relation” through troth, kin or links to landscape. Who owns this body, this estate? Where does the woman hide and what is the empowering eros of her role? Three Novels proposes “disguise as clairvoyant,” and here the wily female body is resistant to ownership as it slips through the hidden paths and plot twists, through the downy lawns, the nocturnal byways, and the gritty train stations into the “accounts most accurate to the invention.


Elizabeth Robinson’s new and original collection recasts three mysterious novels into poetic prose fragments each of which underscores questions also raised in the novels: what is to be believed, which clues should be followed, which layer of meaning represents any form of truth.... this original and intriguing exploration also urges reading itself as a way to grasp our lives.


Martha Ronk


Part lyrical investigation, part investigative evocation, always insightful and original, Elizabeth Robinson’s Three Novels is a poetic journey into the prose delectations of the ever-wonderful Wilkie Collins and George Gissing. Just as Susan Howe’s exploration of Emily Dickinson offered readers a fresh path into her works and days, so now has Robinson traveled back into nineteenth-century England to rediscover masterpieces by two of its most quirky, unconventional giants. A real jewel, Three Novels recalls the ineffable one that Wilkie Collins conjured in The Moonstone, the mystery that T. S. Eliot referred to as “the first...and the best of the modern English detective novels.” And Robinson’s achievement of bringing fresh life to these classics, already bursting with life themselves, is a feat that deserves our gratitude and admiration.

An Interview with Elizabeth Robinson
(conducted by Rusty Morrison)
What is your personal relationship to these three Victorian novels: Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone and The Woman in White and George Gissing's Eve's Ransom? Why did you choose them as your source material?
I chose these three novels because my father read the Collins novels to me when I was a child (early through late grade school). The (to me) beautiful diction of Victorian prose and the pleasure of hearing my father’s fluent reading certainly impacted my sense that I had to become a writer.  Later, as my father and I shared books as ardent adult readers, we read the Gissing novella, Eve’s Ransom, at around the same time.
I wrote these poems shortly after my father’s death, so the book is both a tribute to him and his generosity to me, and a way of integrating the material into my life in a new way.  As you could imagine, I didn’t really understand some of the content of these complex novels when I was a child.  Illegitimacy?  Victorian inheritance laws?  Victorian etiquette?  But the three novels are powerful to me as forms of memory, as a primary interaction with language, and particular lenses on the world.
You’ve described this collection of poems as a project in which you consider the meanings of ownership, with respect to the female body in its social and its physical landscapes. Were you aware of this intention when you began writing the poems? Or did it grow out of the process of writing? Did your relationship to these issues evolve in the process?
One way that I felt I could make this material new to myself was by looking at the role of women in these books.  I first heard them, after all, as the passive listening daughter.  Now I was bereft of that role and in a sense that liberated me to a new perspective.  As readers of Victorian novels know, much of the plot is built around the obstacles that Victorian etiquette throws in the way of direct action and communication.  This seems particularly true of the women characters who are constrained in so many ways.  Yet I feel that both Collins and Gissing show real sympathy and insight into the difficulties that their female characters face.  In any event, we still live in a world where women earn less than their male counterparts.  More often than we acknowledge, or perhaps even register, women’s bodies and activities are monitored and hemmed in.  Not long ago, a man stopped me to the street to praise me because I was dressed “modestly”!
Because of the place I found myself in vocationally and personally when I wrote these poems, I was interested in considering how a woman might, so to speak, be an agent of her own destiny while wandering through a maze.
Each of the three poem series has markedly different approach to the source material. Did you find yourself more in sympathy with one novel over another? Did you find one of the novels more difficult, or more satisfying to engage with? Did you feel there were more risks you needed to take with one over another? Did any of this impact the order you placed them in?
I wanted to make distinct formal decisions in shaping these poems so that the particularities of the books would be more evident.  The Moonstone is said to be the first detective novel and so, in the poem of the same name, I wanted to alternate quasi-prose blocks that had a kind of prose-like orderliness with more open passages that addressed what I saw as the affective undercurrent of the book.  Collins was also a very witty writer, and I felt that I could use the prose shape to convey some of that.  “Romance” works off of Gissing’s Eve’s Ransom which is a strange little novella; it leaves the reader is a state of irresolution that is unusual for books of its era.  The predicament of the heroine causes her to behave in ways that seem equivocal, perhaps not admirable, while the hero is also struggling in various ways.  What interested me is that Gissing conveyed both characters with insight and a relative lack of judgement.  So I began that poem trying to make the characters interchangeable, by using gender neutral pronouns, though I permitted that to shift in the end.  In this era of economic difficulty (which I’ve felt personally and keenly over the past seven years), I wanted to keep a sort of open lyric structure that would consider the ways the press of social and economic constraints shape, even warp, the individual.  “The Woman in White” was by far the most difficult poem for me to write because it is emotionally the most charged for me.  The novel is perhaps my favorite of all novels. I find it so haunting.  I wanted to create the page as a visual landscape to show the sensuous undulations of place in the novel, but also a landscape in which characters were evasive, hid, sought, preyed upon, or engaged with each other.  The poem is for me full of ghosts, not just the various characters of the novel, but the active presence and voice of my father in this work.  I wrote it very consciously as a way of mourning his death.  That poem, then, still remains a site of vulnerability for me, and I feel I have least control over it.
Are there poets from your past, whom you have read and revered, who have influenced your work on this project?
Obviously, Collins and Gissing were the models and sources I was working off here, but Martha Ronk and Cole Swensen come to mind as extremely intelligent writers who often embark upon a book as a kind of research project that entails some element of study as well as poetic interpretation.  I admire both enormously.  In a different way, I would site Kristin Prevallet’s work.  Her I, Afterlife, which she subtitles “an essay in mourning time” gave me permission to work through this material as both a personal and (more obscurely than in her book) political exploration.
Each of your books of poetry is very different from the last. Can you talk about your thinking about the composition of a book as a unified or complicating project? and/or can you talk about how you’ve moved from one project to the next? Are there aspects of a past project that seeded the challenges, or inspired the risks you wanted to take in a subsequent project?
Restlessness and a desire to overleap my own personal clichés influences different decisions about how to bring together a collection of poems.  On the other hand, I admit that I’m an obsessive person and so some preoccupation will get under my skin and it’s sort of like scratching a poison ivy rash: you know you shouldn’t, but you can’t help it.  It feels so good for about 4 seconds and then the rash just spreads.
In my first books, I was just a flailing-around-writer who wrote poems without any sense of the arc of a book.  Working with Keith Waldrop as a graduate student helped me to begin to perceive the ways that poems talk productively to each other.  He is truly a master of shaping discrete poems into a meaningful larger entity.  Since then, I’ve thought a lot about how the act of making poems is an act of attention and so, how might a book-length project stretch attention to new dimensions?  I like the idea of circumambulating an idea and teasing it from varying directions.
As for how I hit upon particular projects, how does that occur for anyone?  A lot of it seems chance—something a student says, the sheer repetition of reading fairy tales to my children, idly wondering if one modernist painter I admired had talked to another.  During the past several years, I have experienced a lot of loss and difficulty, and at a certain point I just gave myself permission to use poetry as a recuperative project, a way of reconstituting myself and my energies in a world that has seemed fundamentally inhospitable. Much of that work is still hidden away, but overall I think that any permission is worth seizing and excavating.
You chose the art used for the cover design. Can you talk a bit about that choice? and about the artist, Fran Herndon?
I hoped that the cover would have a little bit of a feel of being Victorian, but I wanted it to be nonrepresentational so that it didn’t overdetermine the content of the book.  The book exists in multiple time dimensions—a different century entirely, as with the settings of the books, my childhood, and my present. Fran’s artwork seems to me beautiful and suggestive.  There’s a delicacy to the pattern that she created that I hope my poems might also have.  As for Fran, she is my dear friend.  I lived on the 3rd floor of her house in San Francisco, after having been told by Norma Cole that Fran was looking for a tenant.  Only after I moved in did I realize that I already knew of Fran and her work, because a friend (David Abel) had given me a book, Everything as Expected, that details Fran’s collaborations with Jack Spicer.  I recently completed an interview with Fran about her life, her art, and her friendships with Spicer, Duncan, Blaser that will be published in Fact-Simile.
When you read other poets, what are you looking for? What stimulates your interest? and what sustains your interest? Who are the writers you are reading currently for kinship? Who are the writers you are reading currently to be challenged?
I guess I go to different writers for different things in the same way that I enjoy different traits in different friends.  Pretty much every year I spend some time reading Niedecker, Guest, Creeley, and Spicer.  You could say that they constitute a poetic ground of being for me.  Lately I’ve been rereading Chaucer and Robert Kelly’s work with enormous pleasure.  Robert was my teacher as an undergraduate and revisiting his work has shown me what a debt I owe him.  One thing that is significant to me is the way that Barbara Guest, Jack Spicer, and Robert Kelly address the place of spirit, of the unknown, in their work and how they register this as the proper work of poetry.  Fanny Howe is also a mainstay for me in this respect.
Overall, I think I look in poems for a curiosity that leads the poem in new or unexpected directions.  Poetry seems as much inflected with the desire to be fashionable as any other medium, and that results in poetry that doesn’t much interest me.  But as a reader I feel I need to try to leap out of my own proclivities as well.  One thing that has helped me with that has been writing a lot of reviews in the past several years.  Books that come to mind as particularly exciting are Rosa Alcala’s Undocumentaries, Jane Sprague’s Port of Los Angeles, Robert Fernandez’s I am Pharoah, Karin Lessing’s Collected Poems, Craig Watson’s Sleepwalking with Orpheus.  I had a good time looking at the ways erasure projects can turn and relocate the poem with work by Janet Holmes and Travis Macdonald.  And it’s been fun to study the ways mature poets continue to explore and stretch what poetry can do, looking at the work of the ever-delightful Jack Collom, and at poetry by Margo Lockwood and Mary Ferrari.    Come to think of it, I tend to read all poetry as exemplary, as possibility that can extend to my own practice.



Robinson’s poems, at their best, speak at once to an earlier age, and to our own: “The land’s grace incarcerates, redouble’s itself,” notes one line, while “There is no secrecy, only swathing—” quips another. These are darkly pleasant, revealing forays into another era’s mind. When “Pariah” ends “Yet in the eyes of the world, vindication bears little relation to mercy,” one hears all sorts of ghosts and echoes.


Publishers Weekly


Robinson's latest book of poems is a journey through three Victorian novels: Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone and The Woman in White, and George Gissing's Eve's Ransom. In Robinson's deft hands, these three texts come to life with layered evocations of the feminine


American Poet


Robinson rewrites a body and a loss, a descriptive allusion of a woman we might never actually know, from Collins' The Moonstone, considered by many to be the first detective novel, described by poet and critic T. S. Eliot as “the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels […] in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe.” In Robinson's second section, the woman, and what exactly the mystery might be, becomes elusive, and perhaps, secondary to the point of the poems. Writing predominantly in prose poems, she blocks out text, each another step to a mystery that may never be solved.


Eileen Tabios, Galatea Resurrects




Pariah
Think of the self as a locket in which one must carry something foul: a secret innocence. One outcast strolls with another along the country road where they share confidences. A third, the party whose memory has been ruined by his own illness, imparts vindication in fragments and from a distance. This is experimental theory: piecemeal, made of an unconvincing rationality. The culprits are not really culprits. Yet in the eyes of the world, vindication bears little relation to mercy.

Counterpart
Elizabeth Robinson
“For twenty years Robinson has been making language do new things, and for a wonder she’s never afraid of that shadow of words we call affect. In this new collection her precise ear and sense of line sustain a poignant austerity of gesture. She knows that the real dark is the one we keep inside, and her lines scratch at the shell. Her exuberant imagery is chastened here, focused—image names meaning. She probes macabre spaces, golems and hells and devils, but not the ones our culture knows—these are the proper monsters of her self-encounters. The book is exciting in its silverpoint tracing of the complexity of our ‘dubious desires.’” —Robert Kelly

Sanctuary
 
Do you mind, she asked,
if I steal a bit from you. This
she asked again and again until
I discerned that the mere—
the mere asking
got her what she wanted.
 
Do you mind if I steal
a bit from you, I murmured
to myself, forgetting she stood by.
 
Echo like a candle in a cathedral.
Bit as in bite.
 
As she repeated and then
repeated herself, I felt the uneven
 
light, smelled
the warm wax, rising,
as heat does, to the face.
 
I felt her bite the echo from me,
from the great, arcing rose window face of me,
bought and stolen from
me, irregular
with rising warmth.

“In Robinson's most recent collection, ‘identical merges with identity.’ Written in airy, magnetic language, the poet explores ‘bifurcations of the self,’ layers of self and language that we fear to confront because of their sinister, unpredictable traits. The collection's eight sections are separated by epigraph-like fragments from other voices that reverberate in Robinson's own poems. ‘Sanctuary,’ blurs two selves. The thief and the victim become the same: ‘do you mind, she asked,/ if I steal a bit from you.’ This phrase changes, becomes ‘murmured to myself, and then the meanings of the words shift: ‘bit as in bite,’ pulling the rug of meaning from under our feet. Language, in Robinson's hands, is unstable, warped, and deceptive. Her poems roll over and over in quickly changing permutations: ‘the frail opening from/ ration to rational.’ Like Narcissus crashing into the lake to capture his other self, ‘how better to translate,’ Robinson writes, ‘than to destroy.’”—Publishers Weekly, 08/20/2012
 
“Map the themes/ground covered between Hell & Heaven . . . whitespace, the all-steady-hand. The copy / the double / the reflection: as the ‘identical merges with identity’ we look inward for/to the self. Robinson’s lyricism functions as guide & delusion; as to find the self is both necessary and unachievable. Must read.” —Ostrich Review, Fifty-Word Saturday
 
“Despite the desire for ‘pronouns to take on the corporeal,’ to accurately name and give shape to the uncanny, they resist such easy definitions for ‘they are like the static of a sick-dream, / almost amenable and at the same time, / frizzy, off their marks.’ Readers are confronted with an uncanny other, one who is like and unlike us, a macabre Narcissus ‘fascinated with its own blood.’ In exploring this other, the speaker envisions flesh as a possible point of entry: ‘Here’s a fleshy zipper / that opens in my belly, and I unzip and open and then / there I go. Inside and down the path.’” —Aromi Lee, Verse Online
 
“Robinson’s terse, minimalist idiom recalls the work of Niedecker and Oppen, Barbara Guest and Michael Palmer, but it’s an idiom she has made entirely her own through a subtle and exacting deployment of measure and a provocative confrontation with postmodern theology. The scrupulous and tender inquisitions of her earlier work, from In the Sequence of Falling Things to Pure Descent, place her in a small group of contemporary poets (Pam Rehm, Peter O’Leary, Liz Willis, Andrew Joron, Lissa Wolsak, Joseph Donahue, Claudia Keelan and David Miller are a few names that come to mind) whose engagement with the recovery of a radical ontology marks them as some of the most daring poets now writing. By daring, I don’t mean the kind of typographical quirkiness or archly bloviated theory-sprach associated with so much work currently lauded as vanguard. . . . The kind of daring found in Robinson’s poetry evinces a spiritual courage and moral acuity that recalls Simone Weil and Abraham Joshua Heschel. Her deeply informed suspicion of language has not robbed her of an underlying assurance in the hermeneutical circle of meaning. There’s a willingness in her poems to grapple with the aporia of faith and doubt that places her in a line extending from Hadewijch of Brabant and Julian of Norwich to H.D., Robert Duncan and Fanny Howe.” —Patrick Pritchett, writing in Jacket
 
“In an age when identity theft and the appropriation of personae via the Internet run rampant, Elizabeth Robinson’s poems are surprisingly timely. Janus-like, they manage to attend to our oldest and newest questions and fears, simultaneously looking back at philosophical questions of identity that have long concerned mankind, as well as more modern quandaries pertaining to literary collaboration and appropriation. Are we the same people we were yesterday?” —Eric Weinstein, reviewing Also Known As
 
“The problem of how we understand the words of others—or of ourselves—is poignantly explored in Robinson’s poetry. And yet, even now I feel that I am over simplifying the case and reducing Robinson’s work to something not altogether accurate either. It is, after all, here, a conversation—Robinson to Robinson—but any attempt to listen through the poem guides her readers toward new possibilities of meaning. —Dale Smith, writing in Bookslut
 
“Elizabeth Robinson is a poet who, over the span of several books, has created a language that is uniquely her own. Sparse without nearing empty, pared down without ever feeling over-edited or contrived, Robinson’s work belongs to a school of writing all its own. Certainly a part of the lyric tradition but also influenced by a spirit definitively experimental in its nature, Robinson’s poems are both studies in intensely felt human emotion and in the alternatively slippery and concrete ways in which words can function.”  —Reviewed by Marisa Siegel in The Rumpus
 
“Counterpart plays with what the title suggests, composing pieces that explore comparisons as a study of motion, counterparts, counterpoints, doppelgangers, Golem, twins, the repeated binary and what else the mirror holds. . . . Whatever its name, the “other,” her poems suggest, is never as far away as one might hope, and close enough to perhaps have quite an impact. Or, as she writes in the poem “WANDER”: ‘And so all matter is made of words.’  There is such a vibrant energy to Robinson’s lines, composing straight phrases with linebreaks that sparkle and spark across meaning and speed with such an ease as to make any other writer jealous. Elizabeth Robinson is easily becoming one of my favourite American poets.” —Reviewed by Rob McLennan

Elizabeth Robinson was born December 3, 1961 in Denver, Colorado, but grew up mostly in Southern California. She spent her first year of college at UC Davis, where she worked in a crisis counseling center and took poetry workshops with Karl Shapiro. After a year, she transferred to Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where she did a double major in creative writing and psychology, writing her psychology thesis on universal sound symbolism. (She has always understood herself as working at the intersection of multiple disciplines.) While at Bard, she studied with poet Robert Kelly, and also with Ed Sanders and Robert Duncan.
Robinson later did a master’s degree in creative writing at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, where she studied with Keith Waldrop and was an intern with Burning Deck Press. She also worked with C.D. Wright. Visiting writers at Brown, including Robert Creeley, Barbara Guest, and Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge were generous to her and had a lasting impact on her work. During the time she lived in Providence, Robinson worked with autistic people, both as a staff person in a learning center and as a respite care provider.
Following her time at Brown, Robinson moved to Los Angeles, where she worked in an inner city intentional community devoted to community building and racial reconciliation. After a year there, she lived in Oklahoma for three years, first as visiting faculty at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and then as an interim university chaplain.
During the 1990s through the early part of the current century, Elizabeth Robinson lived primarily in the Bay Area where she attended the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley and earned a master of divinity and an MA in ethics. (Not surprisingly, Robinson’s poetry is preoccupied with mystical/theological/ethical questions.) Her two sons, Wilson and Jonah Morris, were born during this time. Isolated from many literary events because she was busy with her children, Robinson started a summer backyard reading series in Berkeley that she continued for 7 years. She likes to think that this was a spark that generated the proliferation of house readings that one still finds in the Bay Area. With Colleen Lookingbill, Robinson founded EtherDome Press, a chapbook press that has published two chapbooks annually of poetry by women who have not yet published a chapbook or book. Recently they have published a ten-year anniversary anthology of women’s writing, As if It Fell from the Sun. Robinson is also a co-editor of Instance Press with Beth Anderson and Laura Sims. Instance Press publishes work by a wide range of experimental poets, from mature writers like Keith Waldrop, Beverly Dahlen, and Jack Collom to emerging writers like Camille Guthrie, James Belflower, and Keven Varrone.
In 2004, Robinson moved to Boulder, Colorado. She has taught there at the University of Colorado and Naropa University. She has also been a visiting professor at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop and the Hugo Fellow at the University of Montana.
Honors awarded to Robinson include the National Poetry Series for Pure Descent, the Fence Modern Poets Prize for Apprehend, and grants from the Fund for Poetry, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and the Boomerang Foundation. She has been awarded residencies at the MacDowell Colony and the Djerassi Foundation. Currently, along with her poetry projects, she is co-editing, with Jennifer Phelps, Quo Anima, a collection of essays on contemporary women’s poetry in relation to spirituality and formal innovation.

The poems of Counterpart where written over a period of several years. I had long carried around (and finally read) a copy of Gustav Meyrink’s The Golem which is set in Prague in the late 19th century and does not conform to the conventional myth of the golem as a creature made from clay, but represents the golem as a double who haunts the narrator. This resounded with my earlier reading of Charles Williams’ Descent into Hell in which a young woman is haunted by her doppelgänger, and a severe form of redemption transpires when she is willing to confront that double.
Increasingly, I noted in all sorts of literature and art the presence of the double. The manuscript is sprinkled throughout with quotes from my (mostly) contemporaries, and one sees the many iterations of the double—the uncanny presence that one recognizes and yet does not. I wondered if this is how we create a community: through this kind of proliferation—of voices, of presences—which we cannot really identify as true and real, but which pervade our thinking and perception anyway. Maybe that eerie sense (the lurking image in peripheral vision) is the realest real. It lies in the identity of the paradox that cannot be proven or resolved but which persists beyond all reason.
Though many of the poems have a kind of bleakness (and it’s been a very bleak stretch of years for me), I prefer to see this haunting as ultimately fertile. In my personal life, I felt confronted, overwhelmed, with a sense of hellishness that threatened to overwhelm and entrap and so I decided that hell itself should be come a terrain of exploration. It might better be understood as a place where the self locates and reproduces itself; in doing so, it presses back against the constraints of understanding that cycle obsessively through the mind (or at least my mind). In the underworld in which one recognizes this uncanny other, there is no guarantee and little safety, but at least there is the possibility that one’s aloneness is not absolute.

		            	"A sign in my studio says, 'please fondle the glass!' I love watching the excitement in the eyes of a guest as they pick up a glass piece and move it across the light, watching the color change then lower it into their hands to rub the smooth surface, embracing the charms inherent in glass as a material." Fascinated with the chemistry of glass, Elizabeth Robinson has developed a special annealing process that allows her to create depth and a sense of movement within the layers of glass. This process preserves the thick reflective core of each piece, exposed by thinner elements of washed color, frit-based texture, and inclusions like Gold Leaf. She says, “If the artist allows glass it’s own language, this will produce a palette for expression unlike any other material”. Robinson’s newest one-of-a-kind sculpture works demonstrate the most cutting edge technologies in glass. Combining knowledge of time-honored glass processes like water jet cutting, glass printing, and casting, she builds on 30 years of experience to develop a new vocabulary for her glass work. Since 1980, glass has held a strong presence in Elizabeth Robinson’s life. Her studies have led her to Pilchuck Glass School, Penland School of Crafts, and The Studio of the Corning Museum Of Glass. Even with all these opportunities to study with amazing artists from around the world, she feels that glass remains the best instructor, and she is forever its student.

ROBINSON%2C+ELIZABETH
















ROBINSON, ELIZABETH 
				COLORADO	







				The pots I craft represent my place in the world, their physicality assembles a sense of the lineage I feel lacking. I am inspired by the myriad of forms and processes I encounter through experience and research: from traditional crafts to industrial ceramics to contemporary paintings. These influences combine to narrate a cultural identity that is revealed within the details of each piece.

I use imagery in a manner both nostalgic and iconic. Fragments of domestic patterns and textbook diagrams converse and instruct. Incised and drawn lines intersect and underlie the transfers- continuing the arc of a handle or emphasizing the awkwardness of a spout rammed against the body of a teapot. 

The direct, sometimes casual manner in which I handle clay and glaze intersects with molded forms, stamps and decals; juxtaposing soft and hard edges, loose and formal lines. This contrast creates a tension between mass and delicacy, refinement and physicality, that I associate with elements of my own personality. 

The back of a platter, the bottom of the foot, contain as much, or more, detail and deliberation as the exposed surfaces. These hidden areas help build the  layers of information, not readily accessible, that must be discovered over time, through acts more intimate than merely gazing. 

Thus, I find that something as straightforward as a cup can be a profound thing. Something simple and useful functions also as a record it its maker, an object of contemplation, of consumption, and an accessory to the rituals of both serving and dining.

BIOGRAPHY

Elizabeth Robinson is a Studio Artist and adjunct faculty at Colorado Northwestern Community College, in Rangely, an isolated town in the high desert mesa country of Northwestern Colorado. Elizabeth’s work is represented in galleries and included in numerous juried and invitational exhibitions nationwide.
 
Bringing together influences as diverse as 18th century English transferware, Japanese Oribe pottery, contemporary painting and industrial ceramics, Elizabeth’s pottery embodies a broad interest in the history of art and craft, ancient to industrial. She strives to make well formed, functional objects, with a sensuous surface, and relaxed posture, that record the transformation of material through process.  Often functioning as a display piece as well as a utilitarian vessel, her pieces take advantage of porcelain's affinity for both delicacy and density, and as a ground for luminous color. 
 
Having discovered a passion for clay on the way to a degree in Botany, Elizabeth decided her interest in beauty, process and morphology was better served as a potter. After receiving her Bachelor’s degree in 1994, Elizabeth traveled widely seeking to expand her knowledge and skills.  She worked in studios across the country, from non-profit art centers, to academia to production studios, including the Mendocino Art Center (CA), Hoyman-Browe Studio (CA), CU Boulder (CO), Carbondale Clay Center (CO) and the Archie Bray Foundation (MT). Upon completing her Masters of Fine Arts degree at Ohio University in 2002, she returned to Colorado to work as Program Director for the Carbondale Clay Center, a non-profit community arts organization, while maintaining an active studio life and exhibition schedule. 

In 2004 Elizabeth made the transition into full time work as a self supporting studio potter, which included marriage, a move to the boondocks, and buying and renovating an old building into her studio. She welcomes any visitor willing to make the trek.
