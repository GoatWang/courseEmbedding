Click a fund name to view that fund's detailed performance information.
The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns and yields on the Fund are net of expenses. Performance shown does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, or redemption fees, which would have reduced the performance.
Morningstar rating as of June 30, 2017. 
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Effective October 1, 2016, as part of the integration of the former Aston mutual funds into the AMG family of mutual funds, the former Aston funds changed names and certain of the AMG funds changed names as well.  Many of the Funds also had certain share class name changes.  See the Fund’s prospectus for additional information.
Footnotes
1. Performance for periods longer than one year are annualized.
2. Performance marked "At NAV" does not reflect the deduction of a sales load that, if reflected, would reduce the performance reported.
3. As of July 27, 2009, the Fund changed its name from "GW&K Multi-Cap Equity Fund" to "GW&K Small Cap Core Fund," adopted the Fund's current investment strategies, and will compare its performance to the Russell 2000® Index. Prior to July 27, 2009 (and for the periods shown below), the Fund focused on a multi-cap equity strategy and compared its performance to the Russell 3000® Index. The performance information shown, as represented by the performance of the Fund's Investor Class shares (formerly Class A shares), includes that of (i) the predecessor to the Fund, the BNY Hamilton Multi-Cap Equity Fund, a series of BNY Hamilton Funds, Inc. (the "Multi-Cap Predecessor Fund"), which was reorganized into the Fund on November 10, 2008, and was managed by GW&K with the same investment objective and substantially similar investment policies as those of the Fund, when it was managed as a multi-cap fund, and (ii) GW&K Equity Fund, a series of the Gannett Welsh & Kotler Funds, which was managed by GW&K and reorganized into the Multi-Cap Predecessor Fund on October 7, 2002. Because the Fund's Service Class and Institutional Class shares have not operated for a full fiscal year, performance history for these share classes is not available. The Fund's past performance would have been different if the Fund were managed using the current investment strategies.
4. The "Since Inception" return and returns for all periods beginning prior to 06/25/02 for the AMG Managers Essex Small/Micro Cap Growth Fund reflect performance linked with a "Predecessor Account" which began operations on September 28, 2000. The Predecessor Account's objectives, policies, guidelines and restrictions were, in all material respects, the same as the Fund's. The Predecessor Account was not registered as a mutual fund and therefore was not subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed upon mutual funds. If the Predecessor Account had been registered as a mutual fund, the Account's performance may have been adversely affected. Prior to March 1, 2006, the Fund had a single share class, which did not carry an up-front sales charge. On March 1, 2006, the existing shares were redesignated as Class A shares. Class A shares have an up-front sales charge. Performance for Class A shares above is based on the performance of the Fund's class in existence prior to March 1, 2006, adjusted to reflect the sales charge applicable to Class A shares.
5. Figures are based on the historical highest Individual Federal tax bracket and do not consider state or local taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax. After-tax returns shown are for the Institutional class. A and C class shares are invested similarly but will have after-tax performance less than that shown because of their higher expenses. Actual returns depend on an investor's situation and may differ. After-tax returns may not be relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements. The after-tax performance figures here may vary from figures provided by other sources if those figures include certain additional tax credits. Pre-liquidation figures include taxes on the Fund's distribution of dividends and capital gains. If the sale of shares results in a capital loss that offsets capital gains or other income, post-liquidation after-tax returns may exceed pre-liquidation after-tax returns. View the individual FQ Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Fund performance table for post-liquidation and pre-liquidation data.
6. Expense Ratio Contract Expiration: The Fund's investment manager has contractually agreed, through the date listed above, to limit fund operating expenses. The net expense ratio reflects this limitation, while the gross expense ratio does not. Please refer to the Fund's prospectus for additional information on the Fund's expenses.
7. The performance information shown includes performance when the Fund had multiple subadvisors and was managed with different investment strategies and investment policies, and was called the "Managers Fremont Global Fund." The Fund's past performance would have been different if the Fund were managed solely by the current subadvisor using the current strategies and policics, and the Fund's prior performance record might be less pertinent for investors considering whether to purchase shares of the Fund.
Disclosure
Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call 800.835.3879 or download a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money.
Load performance: Class C shares carry a 1.00% CDSC if sold within one year of purchase. Performance of Fund classes will differ. Please see the prospectus for details.
The Fund share classes differ with regard to sales charges and Fund expenses. In choosing a Fund and class(es), investors should consider the amount they plan to invest, their investment objectives, the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing, and how long they intend to keep their money invested in the Fund and class(es).

Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This material must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.  

An investment in the Fund involves risk. As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund’s performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to principal risks which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The use of derivatives and/or short positions, such as futures and options, generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. The Fund is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment in the Fund. Shares of the Fund are not FDIC insured, may lose value and have no bank guarantee.

The Fund is not a mutual fund or any other type of investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder.

	Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise, however, the Fund attempts to maintain a portfolio with a negative effective duration and therefore anticipates that an increase in interest rates may increase the Fund’s value, and a decrease in rates may lower the Fund’s value. The NAV of the Fund’s shares relates directly to the value of U.S. Treasuries and Treasury Instruments held by the Fund which are materially impacted by interest rate movements. The magnitude of the impact on value from a change in interest rates is often greater for longer-term fixed income securities than shorter-term securities.

You should carefully consider whether your financial condition permits you to participate in a commodity pool. In doing so, you should be aware that commodity interest trading can quickly lead to large losses as well as gains. Such trading losses can sharply reduce the net asset value of the pool and consequently the value of your interest in the pool. In addition, restriction on redemptions may affect your ability to withdraw your participation in the pool.

Further, commodity pools may be subject to substantial charges for management, advisory and brokerage fees. It may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets.

	ETF Managers Group LLC is the investment adviser to the fund. The fund is distributed by ETFMG Financial LLC. ETF Managers Group LLC and ETFMG Financial LLC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Exchange Traded Managers Group LLC (collectively, “ETFMG”).

Gresham Investment Management
Commodities
New York-based Gresham Investment Management is recognized as one of the world’s leading investment managers focused exclusively on portfolios providing access to a diversified array of commodities. Gresham’s goal is to provide a responsible way to invest in commodities, and to offer clients the benefits of systematic exposure to a wide range of commodities and commodity groups.


Nuveen Asset Management
Fixed Income, Equity and Specialty Strategies
Nuveen Asset Management has a broad range of investment solutions for high net worth individuals and institutional clients. With an extensive history evaluating the municipal bond markets, Nuveen Asset Management offers our clients an approach to investing that emphasizes quality and ingenuity. Today our solutions span multiple asset classes, from traditional and specialized equity to taxable and municipal fixed income. Our heritage demonstrates quality and innovation that stand the test of time.



Annual Allocations

	At the beginning of each year, Gresham allocates to commodities from each of six commodity groups based on
	
global production;
global trade; and
futures liquidity.

	This helps to provide global economic relevancy and adequate liquidity.


Interim Rebalance

	In order to maintain consistent exposure, Gresham selectively rebalances the portfolio when price changes cause actual allocations to deviate substantially from target weightings.


Active Implementation

	Gresham opportunistically rolls positions between different contract months and commodity exchanges based on the team’s experienced assessment of liquidity levels and price activity in the market.


Constraints and Diversification

	The Fund constrains commodity groups as part of the overall program, and individual commodities and commodity complexes within their groups.
	
No commodity group’s target weighting may constitute more than 35% of the total commodity futures portfolio.
No two groups’ combined target weightings may constitute more than 60% of the total commodity futures portfolio.
No single commodity’s target weighting can constitute more than 70% of its group.
No commodity complex target weighting can constitute more than 80% of its group.

Collateral Guidelines


		Cash equivalents or short term debt with terms < 1 year.

		Primarily direct and guaranteed obligations of U.S. Government and senior obligations of U.S. Government agencies.

							A Word On Risk

							
	Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. An investor should consider the following risk factors. Investments in commodity-linked derivative instruments have a high degree of price variability and are subject to rapid and substantial price change which may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. Because the Fund has a significant portion of its assets concentrated in commodity-linked derivative instruments, developments affecting commodities including political and regulatory changes, seasonal variations, weather, technology and market conditions will have a disproportionate impact on the Fund.  More information on these risks, as well as information on other risks to which the Fund is subject, such as clearing broker, counterparty, credit, derivatives, frequent trading, non-U.S. investment, regulatory, subsidiary, and tax risks, are included in the Fund’s prospectus.

LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)










LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus

A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).
