                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Settlement Helps Adaptec Profit                
Adaptec, which makes circuit cards that speed the connections between computers, said yesterday that fiscal first-quarter profit surged because of a one-time gain from a legal settlement. Net income in the quarter ended June 30 rose to $40.8 million, or 33 cents a share, from $2.6 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales at the company, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., fell to $107.3 million from $107.9 million. The results included an after-tax gain of $49.3 million from a May settlement with the former president of the Distributed Processing Technology Corporation, a company Adaptec acquired in 1999. Excluding the gain, profit would have been $3.6 million, or 3 cents a share, from $8.4 million, or 8 cents, a year ago, the company said.










STATE OF THE ART

                    Disc Goal: Pain-Free Burning                
IN the olden days of CD burning, 1997 or thereabouts, software and hardware were considered good if they burned most discs most of the time, even if they fell short of a perfect score. There was only one really friendly consumer program for Windows, Easy CD Creator from Adaptec (called Toast, on the Mac side). But it was understood that no matter how many special prayers you uttered or lucky talismans you waved, the gods might very well hand you a dud disc. Today, the burning business is booming. With the rise of digital cameras and camcorders, even DVD creation on the desktop has become commonplace, and it does not take a record executive to tell you that the MP3 format has made burning music CD's more popular than ever. Fortunately, as disc-burning software and the optical drives that do the dirty work have evolved, the fear of duds has dissipated.











                    Technology Briefing | Hardware: Adaptec Says Quarterly Sales Missed Forecast                
Adaptec, which makes circuit cards that speed up the connections between computers, said yesterday that first-quarter sales missed its forecast as business failed to improve in June as expected. Sales in the quarter ended June 30 were about $107 million, according to preliminary results, less than the $115 million to $120 million the company had forecast, Adaptec said. The company also ''expects first-quarter bottom-line results in the middle of the range projected'' on April 28, which was 2 cents to 4 cents a share. Shares rose 35 cents, to $8.44.










NEWS WATCH: DIGITAL RECORDERS

                    An Afterlife on Disc For That Fading Video                
Videotape has a relatively short life span. Even a tape stored under ideal conditions is likely to be badly deteriorated after 20 years. A 10-year-old tape stacked next to the VCR is likely to be on its last pixel. CD-ROM and DVD discs will last much longer (though claims of 100 years remain unverified). But until recently, getting the family events from tape to disc was a prohibitively expensive proposition -- anywhere from $50 to $150 per tape.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ADAPTEC LOOKS TO STRENGTHEN DATA-STORAGE LINE                
Adaptec Inc., the No. 1 designer of electronic cards that speed computer communications, agreed yesterday to buy Distributed Processing Technology for about $235 million to bolster its data-storage product line. Adaptec will pay about $190 million in cash and $45 million to assume Distributed Processing's employee stock-option plan. Closely held Distributed Processing, based in Maitland, Fla., makes data-storage devices. Through the purchase, Adaptec, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it hoped to strengthen its so-called redundant array of independent disks technology, which allows computer servers to retrieve information stored on other network servers.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ADAPTEC SAYS IT WILL BUY A HYUNDAI SUBSIDIARY                
Adaptec Inc. agreed yesterday to buy Symbios Inc., a subsidiary of Hyundai Electronics America, for $775 million in cash as it seeks to diversify its business and reverse a recent slowdown in sales growth. Adaptec, which makes computer adapter cards that connect PC's to printers, storage drives and other accessories, will take a charge to buy Symbios, which makes external storage devices for Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. Last month, Adaptec, based in Milpitas, Calif., said its third-quarter profit fell 11 percent, to $37 million, because of weak sales in North America. Symbios, based in Fort Collins, Colo., had 1997 sales of $620 million. Adaptec rose 93.75 cents yesterday, to $25.625, before the deal was announced.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ADAPTEC AGREES TO ACQUIRE COGENT DATA TECHNOLOGIES                
Adaptec Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Cogent Data Technologies Inc., a maker of computer networking equipment, for $68 million in stock. The acquisition would increase Adaptec's expertise in a technology called fast ethernet, which speeds up the transmission of computer information through small computer networks in corporate departments. Adaptec, based in Milpitas, Calif., makes electronic components for personal computer manufacturers. Adaptec's shares fell $1.875, to $58, in Nasdaq trading.











                    Sound Bytes; Smoothing the Flow As Peripherals Multiply                
John Adler, chairman and chief executive of Adaptec Inc. of Milpitas, Calif., is an embodiment of the American success story. As a Jew in Hungary during the Hitler years, he recalls scrounging for scraps of food and hiding from the Nazis. After the Communist takeover, he was put to work as a maintenance man at a power plant. He fled to the United States, penniless, but got a scholarship to learn English and later to study electrical engineering. After graduation he was hired by I.B.M. ("$115 a week, I was filthy rich") and quickly rose in the company's management. Burned out by 1979, he quit, bought a boat and "sailed out of San Francisco harbor and turned left." Two years later, refreshed, he returned to join Amdahl, but in 1985 an old I.B.M. friend lured him to Adaptec. Adaptec makes devices called SCSI host adapters and software for PC's. SCSI, which stands for small computer systems interface and is pronounced "scuzzy," directs the flow of information between a computer's processor and its peripherals. Question: One of the great things about the Apple Macintosh is its easy, plug-and-play scuzzy connections. Why isn't scuzzy on the PC just as simple?











                    Adaptec Hires Executive                
F. Grant Saviers, a longtime senior executive at the Digital Equipment Corporation, has joined Adaptec Inc. as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Saviers, who left Digital on July 1, had held several senior management positions in 24 years with the company, most recently vice president of the personal computer systems and peripherals group.
