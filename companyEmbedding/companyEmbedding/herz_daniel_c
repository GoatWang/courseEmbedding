Cons / Hertz lacks a carpool option.  Verdict / This car rental service has an appealing, easily navigable website and all the renting options most people will need. This is a service that lets you customize your rental to your specific needs. Hertz car rental service caters to a wide variety of people. It offers all of the rental types you will need, plenty of extras, a website that’s easy to get around and a plethora of customer support options. The extras include an environmentally friendly carbon offset program, on-site car purchasing program and customizable baby car seat options. Hertz also offers a roadside assistance program, which is especially helpful if you have a long-term rental. Because of its many service and rental options, Hertz qualifies for our Top Ten Reviews Silver Award for car rental companies.Hertz  Visit Site  Number of States with Locations Total number of states with car rental branchesMore is Better.2  Hertz50.0 Number of1  Enterprise50.0 Number of3  Thrifty50.0 Number ofCategory Average45.3 Number ofServicesHertz's strong point is how customizable it is. This company makes it easy to rent a car with special features or add-ons. For example, those with disabilities can easily book a car that meets their needs. Other sites require that disabled customers call a customer service number ahead of time so that an appropriate vehicle can be found or adjusted to suit them. When you order a car through this service, you can specify whether you need left- or right-hand controls and whether you need a wheelchair-accessible bus for concierge services during the rental process. Each lot has cars with hand controls you can rent at no extra charge and without prior notice. Hertz only requests that you check a box for the hand-control vehicle when you fill out the online form.Another feature that is unique to this service is the ability to rent various sizes of child safety seats. Most services only offer toddler seat rentals. The company offers rentals for infants under 20 pounds, toddlers who are 20 to 40 pounds and children who are 40 to 80 pounds. These simple options can make a traveling parent's life much easier, since the alternative is to lug your child's car seat along.On top of these great features, this service also has online check-in so that you don't have to fight the lines at a rental desk. This is especially convenient if you are, for instance, traveling on business and have limited time to catch a flight. Unfortunately, there is no carpool option for people who want to rent a car or van to share with co-workers for an extended period, as there is with other rental services.If you want to buy a car instead of rent one, you can shop on the Hertz website with the site's Rent2Buy section. You can pick the year, model and how far away you are willing to drive to purchase a vehicle. Once you have done so, the site shows you what is available. The car's information includes a picture, mileage, engine type, body style and where the car is located, along with dealer contact information.Types of RentalsHertz has various sizes of cars and vans, as well as luxury, hybrid and convertible models. There are cars that carry five passengers and get nearly 50 miles to the gallon.This service has added a limited selection of pickups to its fleet, including a five-passenger king cab pickup with a relatively small bed that can be used for moving. Hertz also has commercial trucks designed specifically for moving as well as a plethora of vans and SUVs to choose from. There are options for long-term rentals if, for instance, your car is out of commission and you need a car to replace it for a while. You can also take advantage of Hertz's one-way rental option which lets you pick up the car in one area and drop it off in another.Ease of UseHertz has a well-organized site. When you first open the website, it calls to mind the all-but-obsolete phone books that used to be placed on our doorsteps, which may be one reason it feels dated. But once you get past that, it is quite a functional and user-friendly website.The reservation tool and navigation bar are prominently displayed on the homepage, and there is little clutter or gimmicks. This site has a search tool that you can use to find items quickly and easily. The location finder has more features than average. You can search for rental locations by city, zip code or airport, or you can browse a list of all the locations.Help & SupportThe service does not offer online insurance or airport shuttle information, but it does offer great customer service when you have a question. If you need help, you can email customer support or talk with a representative in real time through the chat service or customer care line.A basic roadside assistance program is included with each rental, which covers only the mechanical defects of the car. You can also opt for premium emergency roadside assistance, which provides 24-hour assistance and reduces your financial liability if you should have an accident or other problems with the car.SummaryOne thing that makes Hertz one of the best car rental companies out there is its customizable options. In terms of rental types, it does not have quite as many options as other top rental services, but the user-friendly website makes it easy to find the right car for your needs. Disabled drivers don't need to reserve way in advance, because Hertz branches are equipped with hand-control cars. Parents with young children have many car seat options and a wide selection of family-friendly vehicles. You can also find hybrids and pickups. For its range of options and services, Hertz is one of the best car rental services you can find.Hertz  Visit Site Specifications and BenchmarksHelp & SupportCall CenterEmailInsurance Package Airport Shuttle and Pickup Information ChatServicesNumber of States with Locations 50Wide Airport Availability GPS or Navigation Rentals Online Check-In Business Rental ProgramChild Seat RentalOptions for Physically DisabledCarbon Offset ProgramRoadside Assistance Multiple Country Pick-Up/Drop-Off On-Site Car Purchasing ProgramTypes of RentalsOne-Way RentalsLong-Term RentalsCompactsMid-Size CarsLuxurySUVsHybridsConvertiblesVansPickupsCommercial TrucksPrice ComparisonsDaily Compact Car Price (Vegas)$68Daily Full-Size Car Price (Vegas)$64Daily Compact Car Price (NY)$78Daily Full-Size Car Price (NY)$123Weekly Compact Car Price (Vegas)$250Weekly Compact Car Price (NY)$385Ease of UseEasy-to-Use Reservation Tool Simple Locator Finder Multilingual Website Well-Organized Website Keyword Search Tool Overall Rating 9.13 / 10Ranking2nd in Car Rental Services Visit Site
