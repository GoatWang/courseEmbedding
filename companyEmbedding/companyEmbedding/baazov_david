News » Financial » David Baazov Cashes in His Chips, Sells Almost All His Equity in Amaya David Baazov Cashes in His Chips, Sells Almost All His Equity in Amaya
April 01, 2017
By Katie BarloweDavid Baazov, the founder and former chairman and CEO of PokerStars parent Amaya Inc, has reduced his stake in the company to around 3.8 percent.Former Amaya founder, largest shareholder and golden boy of online gaming David Baazov is now no more than another face at the annual general meeting after selling over $300 million in shares this month.Baazov sold off more than $200 million-worth of the company’s stock this week, having disposed of a further $100 million earlier in the month.Where he began March as the company’s largest shareholder, with 17.2 percent, he’s now close to the back of the dividends queue, when Amaya finally gets around to declaring some.Baazov announced, as he did in early March, that the sell-off was for “investment purposes.” It recently transpired that the Canadian has formed a new company, Ahaka Capital, a “global multi-sector private equity firm.,” according to its website. Ahaka was incorporated last summer and Baazov has been listed as chairman since January.Bomb DetectionHis partner in the new company, Jake Malczewski, who was previously a lawyer specializing in international tax and M&A at KPMG, announced on his LinkedIn page around the time Baazov sold the first lot of Amaya shares that Ahaka had invested in New York-based UVEye.UVEye’s primary product is an inspection device for detecting vehicle modifications or anomalies that may pose a security threat, for use in the military and the fight against terrorism. Bomb detection technology, essentially, and something of a departure from the online poker biz.But Baazov’s decision to cash in his chips also comes after it had been made clear he was persona non grata at Amaya. The former CEO resigned from his executive positions within the company as accusations of insider trading, and an impending trial, had made his position untenable.But he pressed ahead regardless with his ambition to assume control of the company and take it private, a pursuit he ultimately abandoned in December. His fellow shareholders’ asking price had been just too high, he explained.Baazov Frozen OutLast month, Amaya announced it had reorganized its debt to free up spare cash. One of the conditions of this refinancing, imposed by “certain lenders,” was that the company would not be sold to Baazov, directly or indirectly, in the future.     This would cause a “default and potential acceleration of the repayment of the debt under the credit agreement for the first lien term loans,” Amaya warned.Amaya borrowed billions when it acquired the Rational Group’s assets, including PokerStars, in 2014, which means the lenders’ threat, if acted upon, would cripple the company.Baazov pulled off one of the most audacious coups in the history of the industry when he orchestrated that $4.9 billion takeover, but, three years later, he has been forced to move on.Related News ArticlesAnti-Online Gambling Group Says Kids, Terrorists Will Be Next to PlayDavid Baazov Forms New Global Investment CompanyBaazov Sells $100 Million of Amaya Stock as Company Seeks Distance from Former CEOSydney Approves Packer Plan for Crown Ltd.

March 20, 2017
By David SheldonDavid Baazov has a new career. The Amaya founder and former CEO and chairman, who resigned from the board last year as accusations of insider trading threatened to bury him, has formed a new company, installing himself as chairman of the board.David Baazov appears to have sold $100 million of Amaya stock to invest in under-vehicle bomb detection equipment, via his new company Ahaka Capital. (Image: Erik Verduzco/Review-Journal)Ahaka Capital is a “global multi-sector private equity firm” which was incorporated last summer, according to Canada’s La Presse. Baazov has been listed as chairman since January.Ahaka, according to its website, “invests in exceptional businesses and entrepreneurs at all stages of development.”“We support each of our portfolio companies in business development, financing, M&A, and strategy,” it reads. “Our founders started and ran companies that are now collectively worth over $5 billion.”Onwards and UpwardsBaazov presided over the highly-leveraged $4.9 billion takeover of PokerStars by Amaya, transforming the relatively unknown Canadian software provider into one of the biggest remote gambling companies in the world.At the beginning of 2016, he announced his intention to acquire the enlarged company and take it private.But shortly after, he was charged, by the Quebec securities regulator, AMF, with five counts of insider trading. These included accusations that he had attempted to manipulate Amaya stock and had shared privileged information with a close circle of friends and family, allowing the group to profit from illegal stock market trades.Baazov pressed forward regardless with his bid for the Amaya but ultimately threw in the towel in December, saying the shareholders’ asking price was too high.Last month, Amaya announced it had refinanced its debt to free up spare cash. One of the conditions of this, imposed by “certain lenders,” was that the company would not be sold to Baazov in the future.     Sells Amaya Stock, Invests in Bomb Detection Technology Earlier this month, Baazov announced via a press release that he was cashing in almost $100 million-worth of Amaya stock “for investment purposes,” likely related to his new venture. Post-sale, he remains Amaya’s largest individual shareholder.Baazov’s partner in the new company, Jake Malczewski, previously a lawyer specializing in international tax and M&A at KPMG, announced on his LinkedIn page around the time Baazov sold the Amaya shares that he had invested in New York-based UVEye.UVEye’s primary product is an inspection device for detecting vehicle modifications or anomalies that may pose a security threat, for use in the military and the fight against terrorism.Baazov is due to stand trial for insider trading in November.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to Amaya's 2014 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Amaya issued an earnings press release this morning. The release has been filed on SEDAR and will be available on Amaya's website at www.amaya.com. Before beginning its formal remarks, Amaya would like to remind listeners that portions of today's discussion contain forward-looking statements that reflect current views with respect to future events such as Amaya's outlook for future performance. Any such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Certain material factors or assumptions are implied in making forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.
Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations, among other things, include risks related to market factors and other factors discussed in materials filed with the applicable securities regulatory authorities including, without limitation, matters discussed under business risks and uncertainties and the company's annual information form by the year ended December 31, 2014, available on www.SEDAR.com, or that may be filed from time to time in future.
The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect Amaya's current views with respect to future events and except as required by law. Amaya does not intend and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect in particular new information or future events or otherwise.
During the call there will be discussions of some items that do not conform to IFRS, including adjusted net earnings or loss-adjusted EBITDA. Pro forma adjusted net earnings and adjusted net leverage ratios, these measures are defined in Amaya's 2014 earnings result press release from today, which is available on SEDAR.com. These financial measures are used by many investors to compare companies, and management believes they are important measures in evaluating Amaya.
However, they are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. Therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that such measures should not be constructed as alternatives to comparable IFRS measures determined in accordance with IFRS.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's commentary, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for financial research analysts that are covering the Company to queue up for questions. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions per person and be mindful of others. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, March 31, 2015. Replay details are included in the earnings release.
I will now turn the call over to David Baazov, Chief Executive Officer of Amaya. Please go ahead, Mr. Baazov.
David Baazov
Thank you, operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating on today's call. I am joined on the call today by Daniel Sebag, our Chief Financial Officer. Our 2014 results were released today and are available on SEDAR, where you can also find our financial statements and MD&As.

Transformation to a global leader, an online consumer technology, was completed in 2014 with the successful integration of PokerStars and Full Tilt into Amaya. This is evident in our record performance and continued strength during the fourth quarter and full year of 2014.
The strength and vitality of the PokerStars and Full Tilt businesses and the millions of KYC verified customers who trust the brands provide Amaya with a unique consumer Web platform to build upon our success in gaming by adding new verticals, expanding to new markets, and reaching new consumers.
This robust and proven technology platform also provides ample room to scale through organic customer growth as well as through strategic acquisitions that expand our customer base and our consumer offerings. I'll provide more on our future growth strategies in a few minutes, but first I want to focus on our overall performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year.
During the year we generated record results in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and cash flow from operations. This was driven by our consumer business, which we refer to as B2C and is comprised primarily of PokerStars and Full Tilt. Growth came primarily through increased online gaming revenue and sound expense management while still making investments and adding personnel to the business, including in IT and R&D to prepare for future growth initiatives.
As a reminder, we completed the purchase of our B2C business during the third quarter on August 1. Therefore, results for Q4 reflect the full quarter of contribution from the B2C business. In the fourth quarter, B2C business revenues comprised greater than 90% of overall revenues.
The consumer business is Amaya's core platform for growth. In recognition of that, we have initiated a process to explore alternatives to divest our B2B business with the aim of maximizing shareholder value by generating cash to facilitate debt repayment and/or share buybacks.
2014 was a year of transition for the company. However, it continued to grow its leadership position in poker, which is the core business for the company. It increased its market share, launched exciting new products, and continued to expand into emerging growth areas such as Asia and Latin America. This continued global growth in poker reflects the expertise of the management team and the business and the fantastic services it provides.
PokerStars continues to execute on its plan to introduce poker as a competitive game of skill in emerging markets while identifying opportunities to bring new players of the game through product innovation and creative consumer marketing programs. 2015 and beyond will not be different.
We are a poker-first business and will build upon and leverage the popularity of our poker brands and our operational excellence to deliver future growth. Our goal is to double the poker sector in the next five years.
We aim to drive growth in three primary ways. One, the most important driver will be entering new markets where we currently have little or no penetration in real-money poker.
Second, creating consumer demand and excitement through innovative marketing and promotions. Third, continuing to innovate the product to attract more players and reactivate lapsed players.
Let me talk a little bit about new and emerging geographies and newly regulated jurisdictions. Notably, the company is making investments to grow its business in Asia, which is currently an emerging market for the game of poker but is historically a strong gambling market.
Recent poker pro and celebrity endorsements and the launch of PokerStars-sponsored live poker events and branded poker rooms and casinos in new areas of Asia, such as Manila, are recent examples of the strategy. These initiatives stimulate consumer interest in poker and establish strategic business relationships with partners, regulators, and governments in emerging markets ahead of potential regulation of online poker.

In the primary market of Europe, there is an ongoing trend toward countries establishing independent regulatory and licensing regimes. PokerStars holds licenses in 12 European jurisdictions, including most recently the United Kingdom.
The business is opportunistically looking to leverage its scale, reputation, and expertise to grow its business, including through targeted marketing efforts designed to grow market share in jurisdictions which have recently established gaming duties or other taxes where we expect competitors to scale back marketing efforts.
Outside those continents, the company is aggressively pursuing growth opportunities in the Americas. Notably, populist countries in South America and in the United States where we are actively lobbying for online gaming legislation in a variety of key states including California and Pennsylvania.
And we continue to work with the New Jersey regulator toward final approval to launch our consumer business in that state, where a B2B online casino business already operates.
While geographic expansion is anticipated to be the biggest driver of the growth of poker in future years, the business is also looking to grow organically through new and innovative marketing campaigns including the use of endorsements from global celebrities, compelling consumer promotions to increase the popularity of online poker.
Finally, we are filling our innovation pipeline with exciting new games and player promotions that we anticipate will reactivate lapsed players, excite new poker players, and gain more play from existing players.
This formula has evidence from the successful launch and promotion of PokerStars' new Spin & Go tournaments, which combines fast play with various jackpot-style payouts to players and was first successful on Full Tilt, as jackpots in those. I'd like to let you know after less than six months of play PokerStars held its 100 millionth Spin & Go tournament this month.
PokerStars and Full Tilt plan to launch more you game variants, improve upon their already industry-leading mobile poker offering, and implement social and engagement layers in the real-money offerings.
Poker is and will continue to be the primary focus. However, we plan to leverage the poker consumer base of more than 91 million cumulative registrations to build additional significant new revenue streams with other gaming and non-gaming offerings.
PokerStars and Full Tilt have already begun strategically rolling out other gaming offerings in order to attract new customers and serve the estimated 40% to 50% of our existing customers who already have casino or sports book accounts on competitors platforms.
Full Tilt launched casino table games in February 2014 and has bolstered this offering with the introduction of live dealer games, baccarat, and online slots from best-of-breed third-party providers including Amaya's online casino games provider.
Having established a relatively full casino offering, Full Tilt continues to achieve a cross-sell percentage to eligible players of greater than 30%, with the games generating a gross yield approximately double its poker yield.
PokerStars introduced casino table games to players in the regulated Spanish market in late Q3 before rolling them out globally as part of a voluntary upgrade of the PokerStars software in late Q4. The results were similarly strong, with yield multiples approximately 1.5 times the poker yield despite only blackjack and roulette being available, only two games.
The software upgrade became mandatory for all PokerStars players this year, making blackjack and roulette games available to all eligible active users. In Q1, PokerStars rolled out live dealer games and will soon introduce baccarat and online slots as it anticipates adding more games in 2015.

We are expanding these games to be available on mobile apps in certain jurisdictions, and we'll introduce for the first time a browser-based casino in 2015. This will create opportunities to make casino a customer acquisition channel in its own right, offering new consumers the advantages of a shared online wallet with the most trusted brand in online gaming. The initial experience with casino has been that a significant majority of the casino wagering has been on top of rather than cannibalizing the pre-existing poker card.
I am happy to say this morning PokerStars took its very first sports bets as it began rolling out a beta version of its sports betting offering in select markets with the intention of expanding across the dot-com global network through the next two quarters of 2015.
Sports betting is a very large addressable market for the business and is a product that much of the current player base have been asking PokerStars to provide for some time. The business believes there is a strong crossover potential between the verticals, and PokerStars wants to grow the poker economy by attracting players from elsewhere who are currently making sports bets with other providers. The business anticipates this will help attract more recreational players to PokerStars poker games.
Notably, in conjunction with the beta launch of sports betting, players will be able to access their PokerStars accounts via their Web browser for the first time. Account holders will be able to securely log into the PokerStars website with their existing PokerStars credentials to access sports betting and their PokerStars cashier. The intention is to develop this service for casino and poker in the near future.
We have also taken the strategic decision to enter the daily fantasy sports category and are pursuing parallel tracks of internal development and strategic acquisitions. We expect to provide more details on this strategy in the second half 2015 but see a clear crossover from poker and daily fantasy sports.
We believe casino and Sportsbook are verticals that will respond well to mobile offerings. We have therefore been impressed with the business' ability to continue to drive new customer acquisition through its leading mobile offerings, which are available for both iOS and Android devices.
The business has seen strong growth over the past three years in players, deposits, and gross gaming revenue coming from its mobile applications. Almost 60% of PokerStars' new customer acquisitions were obtained via mobile in Q4. At the end of 2014, cumulative registration had grown to more than 91 million.
I'll now turn to call over to Danny for a look at financial results and outlook.
Daniel Sebag
Thanks, David. Starting with our top line, revenues were $369 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $37 million in Q4 of 2013, with growth driven by the consolidation of revenues from the two businesses we acquired in 2014.
Specifically, the B2C business comprised primarily of PokerStars and Full Tilt, which we acquired on August 1, and Diamond Game, which we acquired in February. For the quarter, the B2C business comprised approximately 92% of overall consolidated revenue.
Moving on to expenses. Our total expenses increased to $345 million from $36 million in Q4 2013, with the increase driven by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses related primarily to the consolidation of the B2C business and Diamond Game, and higher financial expenses, which primarily related to interest on increased leverage.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $155 million versus $17 million in Q4 of 2013, with the vast majority generated by the B2C business. A reconciliation to our IFRS, EBITDA, and net income is included in our earnings release.

Adjusted net earnings in the quarter was $86 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, versus $11 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in Q4 2013, with the increase reflecting the contribution of the acquired B2C business. A reconciliation to our IFRS net income is included in our earnings release.
The Corporation generated cash flows from operating activities of $56 million compared to $3 million in Q4 2013. Our financial statements obviously do not include the performance of the B2C business for the full year of 2014, as we only acquired it on August 1.
However, we can say that revenues for the B2C business in 2014 grew approximately 11% over 2013 to $1.258 billion. This excludes one-time revenues reported in the fourth quarter of 2013. The growth was driven by increased poker revenues and other income including casino revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 23% over 2013 to approximately $530 million. Growth was driven by the increase in revenues, including high margin income streams and expense management.
Looking back at our full-year results versus our previously announced 2014 guidance. On November 10, 2014, Amaya affirmed it’s previously announced guidance for the full year of 2014, with the revenue of $669 million to $715 million and adjusted EBITDA of $265 million to $285 million, with results expected at the high end of the range. The actual full year 2014 revenues were $688 million and adjusted EBITDA of $293 million.
Looking ahead for full-year 2015 guidance, today Amaya announced that it anticipates full-year revenues in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.74 billion. This is based on a USD to CAD exchange rate of 1.26 as that closed on March 27, 2015.
Assumptions include a full year of revenues from both Amaya's B2C business, which comprises approximately 90% of revenues, and its B2B business, which is approximately 10% of revenues.
B2C revenue growth is anticipated to be driven by an increase in B2C poker, casino, and sports book business revenues. Amaya does not currently separate out revenues for the B2C business various product lines but may consider doing so in the future once casino and sports book reach a stage it determines to be material enough to do so.
Adjusted EBITDA of $670 million to $715 million, this is based on a USD to CAD exchange rate of 1.26 as of close on March 27, 2015. Assumptions include a full year of adjusted EBITDA from the B2C business, which comprises approximately 90% of adjusted EBITDA, and the B2B business, which is approximately 10% of adjusted EBITDA.
B2C growth to be driven by B2C casino, sports book, and the core poker business, which is anticipated to offset an estimated $45 million in new value-added taxes and UK point of consumption taxes on the core poker business. This is net of VAT and POC taxes on casino and sports book.
And an approximate $60 million impact from the reduction in purchasing power of global depositing currencies relative to the US dollar-denominated games. I'll touch on this in a minute.
Excluding the impact of VAT, point of consumption, and the FX impact, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been on a USD basis approximately $636 million to $672 million dollars.
Three, pro forma adjusted net earnings of $367 million to $450 million, or $1.77 to $2 per diluted share. This is a pro forma figure, as is the divestiture of the entire B2B business occurred as at December 31, 2014 and is designed to give fuller insight into the anticipated profitability of Amaya's core B2C business.
Finally, an adjusted net leverage ratio of 4 to 4.5 turns at December 31, 2015. Adjusted net leverage ratio is defined as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA, but after giving effect to the anticipated divestitures of our B2B assets. For clarity, adjusted net debt means Amaya's anticipated total financial leverage minus cash.

For this measure, Amaya's cash balance includes cash that is currently being set aside for the deferred payment that is the final piece of the purchase price for the ultra group, payable by 2017. The cash amount, though, does not assume any potential cash generated from the exercise of warrants that have maturity dates extending beyond 2015.
We currently anticipate Q1 will be our clueless quarter of the year, likely about 20% of the anticipated full year figures, as the new verticals rolling out this year will provide benefits to the top and bottom line and marketing initiatives and promotions, which we have been making investments for already, begin to launch in the second and future quarters. I will refer you to our cautionary comments on forward-looking statements and non-IFRS measures announced at the beginning of the call.
I'd like to provide a bit of clarity on currency at this time. As it relates to the B2C business, PokerStars and Full Tilt are global businesses. Greater than 60% of the businesses comes from the European Union. Due to this strong presence, approximately half the deposits made on the platforms are made in euros, which is by far the largest depositing currency.
However, outside of the ring-fence markets of France, Italy, and Spain, which represent approximately 20% of the business, the vast majority of real-money poker game play occurs in US dollars.
Therefore, the recent decline in global currencies against the US dollar reduces the purchasing power of the global player base, which can impact revenues as calculated in USD, though it may not in Amaya's reporting currency of Canadian dollars as the Canadian dollar also declined relative to the USD, as it has.
Additionally, the percentage drop in the global currency versus the US dollar does not typically result in a commensurate drop in USD revenue from that jurisdiction, as there is often a point of resistance due to the engagement of the player base.
For example, from the beginning of this year to March 17, gross deposits in USD decreased just over 10%. However, on a domestic currency basis deposits actually increased approximately 9%.
The B2C business employees a hedging strategy to mitigate payment processing currency risks including forward swaps. Amaya has also recently entered into cross-currency swap agreements designed to improve matching of the currency denomination of the assets and liabilities of Amaya's B2C business. Essentially meaning, if the euro drops relative to the USD below the rate of 1.1102, Amaya's debt becomes cheaper.
Additionally, we anticipate the swaps will result in lower interest payments on existing debt, as the synthetic euro denominated debt has fixed euro interest payments at an average rate of 4.6% instead of a USD interest payment bearing a minimum floating interest rate of 5%, but which could be higher if LIBOR were derived above 1%.
The swaps relate to our USD $1.7 billion seven-year first-lien term loan secured on August 1, 2014. The swap agreements have a stated termination date of five years and have a notional amount of more than $1.74 billion dollars.
I'll now turn to call back to David.
David Baazov
Thanks, Danny. As you can see, the company is delivering on the high expectations we had for the PokerStars acquisition and our transformation. I am particularly proud of management's ability to perform very well despite numerous significant potential distractions including the management changes related to Amaya's ownership, the launch of significant new products, adjusting to the requirements of a listed company, and the ongoing review of trading activity in the company's shares prior to the PokerStars acquisition being conducted by Quebec securities regulators.
These are all significant management challenges that we are dealing with very successfully, as our results demonstrate. I do want to address the ongoing AMF investigation briefly. At this time, I do not have any additional information regarding the substance of the investigation, but I can provide you with these key facts.

Amaya thoroughly reviewed the relevant internal activities around the Ultra Group acquisition and has found no evidence of any violation of Canadian securities laws or regulations, nor has the company been provided with any evidence that any executive directors or employees violated any securities regulations.
The AMF investigation is to our knowledge the only investigation into the trading of our shares. We continue to cooperate with the AMF and respond to requests by all relevant parties. We are confident that once reviews are complete, the AMF will reach the same conclusion that we have, if there were any violations of Canadian securities laws, they were not perpetrated by the company, officers, or directors. The corporation intends to provide further updates on the investigation when it is permitted.
Turning our attention briefly to the future, I'd like to go over a few recent corporate developments. As we previously indicated, we are working on a dual listing which is intended to be completed before October of 2015 but which we expect to complete earlier than that.
As a global consumer Internet Company, we have determined the most appropriate location is on the NASDAQ in New York City, and we have therefore applied for a listing on the NASDAQ global select market. We look forward to providing more details in the near future.
We continue to execute on our previously stated goal of divesting our B2B assets in a way that delivers the greatest shareholder value. A recent announcement on the spinoff of Diamond Game and the proposed sale of Cadillac Jack are consistent with this strategy. We expect to provide further updates on the divestiture process of our other B2B business in the near future.
With the divestiture process well underway, we are focused on our growth strategy of expanding the existing business organically and through strategic acquisitions that will allow us to leverage our current platform while adding new product, new geographies, and new consumers.
Again, it's been a record year for Amaya, and we believe we have rewarded our shareholders by executing against the strategic vision that continues to come into sharper focus even as we grow, and we believe will bring even greater opportunities for the future.
I am just going to go off script for a second, and I'd just like to thank all the employees at Cadillac Jack for their tremendous efforts and accomplishments in a little over two years that Amaya has owned the business. I'm sure there's a lot, there are probably too many individuals to name. But Mauro Franic and Sigmund Lee, if you are listening, you've really done a tremendous job and provided great leadership at that business. And the sale comes with some mixed emotions for me, as I have truly enjoyed working with them and with all of Cadillac Jack in achieving success that we have.
At this point, I would like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Thank you all.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eyal Ofir from Dundee Capital. Your line is open.
Eyal Ofir
Thanks, congratulations, guys, on the results and the strong guidance.
David Baazov
Thank you.
Daniel Sebag
Thanks.
Eyal Ofir
First off, just in your prepared remarks you discussed how Full Tilt launched, I think, both the table games and slots, but the PokerStars platform has not gone into slots yet. Can you just talk about what you've launched?
What jurisdictions or what percentage you have actually hit, I guess, with the PokerStars rollout into casino? What should we expect for the rest of 2015? And obviously the yield here is fairly significant, so should we anticipate, I guess, in the back half in terms of the yield on casino -- what should we expect there as well?

David Baazov
Eyal, what I would say is that currently all we've launched from an online casino perspective is blackjack and roulette. Late in the first quarter we also launched Live Dealer, some table games. But we expect to launch baccarat and some slots in, I would say, the next 30 days.
And we're going to continue filling up our full casino offering. And I would say it will be full, we expect, in Q3. At the same time, the only other offering outside of casino that we recently launched, sports betting which was today.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. And then the sports betting, you talked about the beta launch today. When should we anticipate the rollout for, I guess, the 50% of your market -- how should we expect that to hit over the year?
David Baazov
We are saying that that's going to be done. Our expectation is it will be the next two quarters. You are looking at by the end of Q3 the full launch. Whether it happens sooner, it's possible. But right now what we are going to say is we take a similar approach to what we did with casino.
If you take a look at the cross-sell percentage and the yield that I mentioned during the call, that's with blackjack and roulette. That's two games, and that's what we are already doing.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. That's great. And then just looking ahead into 2016, obviously you gave some pretty strong numbers in the pro forma for 2015 on the bottom line. You guys are making significant investments here on marketing, as we see in the numbers in this quarter but also your commentary.
How should we think about the business growth as you turn on 2016? What should we think about from an earning standpoint as well as we are modeling this out? Thanks.
David Baazov
I'm going to let Danny touch on this a bit, but I would say from my perspective we expect strong growth that's expected to be greater than 20%. Danny?
Daniel Sebag
It's a bit early to tell, but I expect that to be the case.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. Great. And then just obviously you guys are heading into Asia and other jurisdictions. Could you just talk about what the regulatory landscape -- what's going on in Asia right now in specific jurisdictions?
Also in the US has been obviously a headline, obviously the investor base is looking at potentially you guys entering the US market. You talk about New Jersey, the status there. And California, what are your thoughts on the currently billing – bills are, and then the progress in other states?
David Baazov
Eyal, that's like an eight-point question, by the way. So to talk a little bit about Asia and what we expect there, we are seeing -- we are working. What we could say at this time is that we are working with regulators in some of these Asian countries and governments to come in and provide for and regulate online poker. We are strategically working in select jurisdictions with large population bases where we feel that there is a strong demand for poker.
As it relates to New Jersey, California, and other states, we are as I said actively lobbying. I think it's very public and clear about the partnership and the relationship we have with our coalition in the state of California, which we are very, very pleased with. And I have to say they are true partners in every word, in every sense. As it relates to New Jersey, I would say that we feel this is coming. We would expect to receive and launch, I would say, in the next quarter.
Eyal Ofir
Great. I'll pass the line. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Robert Young from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Robert Young
Hi, good morning. Thanks for the detailed outlook; that's great to see. I was hoping that you could give us a sense -- bring it back to the poker business and give us a sense of what the organic growth of the rational group poker businesses were in Q4 and how you expect that to develop into Q1 now that we are at the end of that quarter.

And maybe at the same time clarify what you said, that in Q1 you were expecting that to be 20% of the full year. Is that revenue, EBITDA -- what exactly is that? And I've got a follow-up.
David Baazov
I would say the growth is mid-single digits. And in terms of what we said -- Danny -- what you are saying in terms of Q1, if you want to clarify that?
Daniel Sebag
Yes. Q1 is, obviously there's a lot of new games that are going to be coming online -- just new verticals, new markets. Q1 is really a quarter where we are making a lot of investments. So we expect Q1 to be the weakest quarter of the entire year, representing approximately 20% of our guidance.
David Baazov
So, Rob, just to quantify, if the anticipated full launches of products -- and what I've been mentioning probably in Q4, that maybe perhaps some people haven't taken note of, was the fact that there's a strong window of opportunity this calendar year given that there is the introduction of VAT, POC, we clearly see marketing costs being driven down for people to be able to have their EBITDA bridge – their lowering marketing tasks.
So one of the initiatives that I said that we would be undertaking is increasing it. So if we are investing in marketing costs to get a benefit in Q3, well, you make that investment in Q1.
Robert Young
Okay. So when you say 20%, that's an EBITDA metric, then?
David Baazov
Right.
Robert Young
Okay. And then my follow-up will be related to the gross yield that you provided on casino; you said it was around 2 times poker yield. Is that a blended number? Is that on the cross-sold players you are seeing? Or is that on new players? Maybe if you could give us just a sense of what the yield per poker player, to dimension that, that would be helpful.
David Baazov
I'd say it's on a blended number, Rob. What was the second part of your question was?
Robert Young
Is there a – can you give us a sense of what the yield per player on poker is?
David Baazov
We can't. We haven't provided that.
Robert Young
Okay. And then the last question for me, you said that you are going to be poker first, but you also noted that you were planning some non-gaming offerings. I was wondering, what does that mean? Is that branding? How should we take those two statements together?
David Baazov
I'd have to say, you'd have to stay tuned.
Robert Young
Okay. I'll pass it on, then.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Garcea from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Ralph Garcea
Good morning. I just wanted to clarify that 20% again for Q1. Is that also on your revenue, or just on EBITDA as 20% of the full-year number?
Daniel Sebag
It actually is. Yes.
Ralph Garcea
20% of both, revenue and EBITDA? And why I'm asking is it's going to be the second full quarter for you guys. What sort of seasonality are you seeing through Q1 on the PokerStars side? And also on the casino with a limited launch you had from a seasonality perspective?
Daniel Sebag
From a seasonality perspective, I'd say that typically Q4 is the strongest and is best. But when Danny -- I just want to point out when Danny is saying 20%, it's 20% of our full-year's revenue, which is growing, that's happening in Q1. So you are still seeing growth.
Ralph Garcea
And on the – it's the first time you sort of mentioned the fantasy sports side of the business. Have you guys already developed the product, or are you just going through that initial stage and you'll release a beta in the second half of the year? What's the planned rollout?
David Baazov
The goal is to be up before the NFL season starts. We clearly see a strong demand for it. A lot of the specifically US players that were formerly PokerStars players would like to see us launch fantasy sports. So I would say that that's the goal, really launching it by the NFL season.

It's a clear, strong crossover with poker. And given the size of our database, you couldn't actually acquire somebody and leverage their entire platform because nobody's software that we've seen can currently support our volume that we would have if we launched fantasy sports.
Ralph Garcea
Okay. And then on the currency side, you are using $1.26 for the US dollar. What currency or what exchange rate are you using for the euro in the guidance?
Daniel Sebag
I'm using an average of 105 per euro to USD.
Ralph Garcea
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David McFadgen from Cormark Securities. Your line is open.
David McFadgen
Hi. Sorry, Danny, just a couple of questions on your prepared remarks. You talked about the B2C revenue in 2014 as being $1.258 billion, up 14% year over year. Was that a US number?
Daniel Sebag
That's a Canadian dollars number.
David McFadgen
That's a Canadian dollar number. Okay. And that excludes some one-time revenue that Stars pulled into their results?
Daniel Sebag
Exactly. In 2013, there was some one-time revenues that resulted – there was a change in accounting policy in 2013. In Q4, that resulted in one-time revenues that were factored out of our analysis.
David McFadgen
Okay. And that's the dormant accounts?
Daniel Sebag
That is it.
David McFadgen
Okay. And can you provide us any color on tax implications for Cadillac Jack and Diamond Game individually?
Daniel Sebag
Yes. So as it relates to that transaction, obviously we have some color. But until we complete the transaction, I can't really give any guidance on the ultimate tax impact.
David McFadgen
Okay. And then just one additional one, if I may. Also in your prepared remarks you talked about Q1 -- the growth of deposits decreased 10%. I wasn't able to follow along. Can you just provide some color on that?
Daniel Sebag
So on a domestic basis, currencies are actually up. On a US basis, when you covert the actual domestic deposits into USD they are down because of the movement of the USD relative to the euro.
David McFadgen
Okay.
Daniel Sebag
So the domestic players are increasing their deposits by 9% in their actual local currency, so it indicates poker is robust.
David McFadgen
But then when you convert it back into Canadian, you gain some of that back, right?
David Baazov
That is correct.
David McFadgen
Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Steve Li from IAS. Your line is open.
Steve Li
So first question, you guys have a relatively big market share on the poker side. Going forward, what are the challenges to maintain that market share or even to increase it? Is it through more marketing spend, or is it through more product innovation? 
David Baazov
I'd say it's both. I would say that given the window of opportunity for this calendar year with the introduction of that, POC, et cetera, we see the cost of acquiring an online casino player actually coming down a bit, which it hasn't done so in more than the last five years. So we are spending more from a marketing perspective this calendar year. While at the same time, clearly with product innovation you actually grow your player base, as you can see with Spin & Go. We plan to do both.
Steve Li
Great. So long-term, what are your trends? Do you see that trend to continue? Where do you think your cost of acquisition of new customers is coming down, especially with new opportunities related to new geographic markets, new segments? You are about to launch things like sports bet and things like that. Is that still reasonable to think that your cost of acquisition won't go down?
David Baazov
Yes, we believe that it will. The predominant factor here is, as a clearly stated on the call, our goal is to double the size of poker in the next five years. That happens through three primary ways. Obviously, geographic expansion has been a massive growth driver for the expansion of poker, historically. And we still believe that there is a lot of growth there, and product innovation is going to be another one. But currently PokerStars enjoys the lowest cost of layer acquisition in the industry already.

Steve Li
Perfect. Maybe can you discuss quickly the challenges to release a new product like for the sports bet towards Q3. What are your expectations down the road in three to five years? Do you think that the market be -- how significant can it be?
David Baazov
So the launch of sports betting has actually occurred today. The expectation is that it will be fully rolled out to all the available players in Q3. We take the same measured approach that we have historically.
We are not in a rush. If we are going to do it, we want to do it right. I'd say that sports betting as a vertical – not could be, will be, very significant of a vertical for Amaya. It will probably become the second-largest vertical, eclipsing casino over time.
Steve Li
Maybe a little follow-up question, is there any ROI for you guys when you guys find out sports delivery? Is there a metric that you guys look for in terms of number of increasing number of leads, or is it just increasing your brand presence?
David Baazov
I didn't understand part of your question. Increasing – you said, leads?
Steve Li
When you guys find up deliveries, is there key metrics that you guys look for initially in those geographic markets in terms of increasing new customer base? Or is just serving [ph] the brand and making sure increasing the awareness of your platform?
David Baazov
We measure on ROI on every single marketing campaign that we do. So in terms of brand awareness, our brand awareness of PokerStars is already in excess of 60% on a global basis on international awareness. So the purpose here is we measure every single marketing campaign in ROI.
You are launching two new verticals at a time when people are actually, in most cases, spending less in marketing. So we are taking advantage of that and have allowed to have an increased marketing spend on that basis.
How do we measure what we are looking for is, I'm not just looking at the predictable portion which we'll be cross-selling, which will be because we have this massive customer player pool that will immediately start to play on our verticals the day we offer it to not have wallet management.
They won't need to manage a wallet off two different sites or three different sites, and they can now amalgamate it on one site. What we are actually looking for is the most independent customer acquisition in those channels specifically based on having a better product offering than our peers.
Steve Li
Thanks a lot for taking my questions.
Operator
And this concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over for closing remarks.
David Baazov
I'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call. We certainly appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest and support of Amaya. Thank you, and good-bye.

David Baazov (Georgian: დავით ბააზოვი; 1883–1947) was a Georgian-Jewish public and religious figure who spearheaded the Zionist movement in Georgia. His program was an amalgam of moderate orthodox religiosity, enlightenment, and Zionism. He was born in Tskhinvali, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) into a family of rabbis. He was educated in Jewish philosophy and history at Slutsk and Vilnius where he became exposed to Zionist ideas.

1903[edit]
In 1903, he attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel. Returning to Georgia, Baazov became a rabbi in the town of Oni and quickly emerged as a leader of Zionism in Georgia. His growing influence was opposed by a group of anti-Zionist rabbis and the so-called "assimilationist" Jewish intellectuals who put forward the thesis that the Georgian Jews were ethnic Georgians and "Israelites by religion."[1]
1918[edit]
In 1918, Baazov founded the first Georgian-Jewish Zionist paper ebraelis khma ("The Voice of Jew") and helped organize the All-Jewish Congress in Tbilisi which included representatives from every Georgian and Russian Jewish community in the country, except for Kutaisi, which had become the center of the Jewish anti-Zionism. At that time, he served as a rabbi in Akhaltsikhe and exploited his friendly ties with a local Muslim clergy to save many Christians during a brief Ottoman occupation of the area in 1918.
1921-1925[edit]
After the Sovietization of Georgia in 1921, Baazov, aided by his son, the leading Georgian-Jewish writer Gerzel Baazov, organized Jewish schools across the country and later founded the magazine makaveeli ("Maccabean") which was closed by the Soviet authorities during a crackdown on Georgian Jewish cultural institutions after the 1924 anti-Soviet August Uprising in Georgia. Next year, he managed to secure the free passage for several Georgian Jewish families to the Land of Israel, launching the first large wave of Aliyah from Georgia.
1938-1945[edit]
During the purge of 1938, both of his sons were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and Gerzel was executed. Soon, David Baazov was also arrested and sentenced to death for "Zionist activities". The sentence was later commuted to exile in Siberia. In 1945, he returned to the Georgian SSR and chiefly engaged in educational activities.
Legacy[edit]
The main writer on David Baazov and the main collector of his works was his daughter Fanny Baazova (1912–1980). The Georgian Jews' History Museum in Tbilisi has been named after him.[2]

David Baazov (Georgian: დავით ბააზოვი; 1883–1947) was a Georgian-Jewish public and religious figure who spearheaded the Zionist movement in Georgia. His program was an amalgam of moderate orthodox religiosity, enlightenment, and Zionism. He was born in Tskhinvali, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) into a family of rabbis. He was educated in Jewish philosophy and history at Slutsk and Vilnius where he became exposed to Zionist ideas.

1903[edit]
In 1903, he attended the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel. Returning to Georgia, Baazov became a rabbi in the town of Oni and quickly emerged as a leader of Zionism in Georgia. His growing influence was opposed by a group of anti-Zionist rabbis and the so-called "assimilationist" Jewish intellectuals who put forward the thesis that the Georgian Jews were ethnic Georgians and "Israelites by religion."[1]
1918[edit]
In 1918, Baazov founded the first Georgian-Jewish Zionist paper ebraelis khma ("The Voice of Jew") and helped organize the All-Jewish Congress in Tbilisi which included representatives from every Georgian and Russian Jewish community in the country, except for Kutaisi, which had become the center of the Jewish anti-Zionism. At that time, he served as a rabbi in Akhaltsikhe and exploited his friendly ties with a local Muslim clergy to save many Christians during a brief Ottoman occupation of the area in 1918.
1921-1925[edit]
After the Sovietization of Georgia in 1921, Baazov, aided by his son, the leading Georgian-Jewish writer Gerzel Baazov, organized Jewish schools across the country and later founded the magazine makaveeli ("Maccabean") which was closed by the Soviet authorities during a crackdown on Georgian Jewish cultural institutions after the 1924 anti-Soviet August Uprising in Georgia.

David Baazov Brother Target of AMF Search Warrants for Alleged Securities Fraud in Quebec
March 24th, 2016 by Philip Conneller

Canadian financial regulator AMF is pursuing Amaya CEO David Baazov’s elder brother Ofer “Josh” Baazov for alleged securities fraud, it announced yesterday.
Josh Baazov (second from right) and Craig Levett (second from left) representing Amaya to casino officials in the Dominican Republic in 2012. They are both now named as suspects in an ongoing security fraud investigation by the Quebec regulator. (Image: listindiario.com)
The elder Baazov has an apparently shady history, having once served 90 days in prison for possession of cocaine, as well as operating a telemarketing scam that conned gullible customers out of hundreds and thousands of dollars.
Just hours after the shocking news that Amaya’s CEO was facing five counts of insider trading, a second official AMF statement announced that it had executed search warrants and obtained freeze-and-cease-trade orders against of a separate group of 13 individuals, including Josh Baazov.
Those orders mean the thirteen cannot initiate or complete any trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange while the orders remain in place, and also gives the AMF the power to freeze bank accounts and seize any tangible assets.

The AMF alleges that the 13 suspects “traded while in possession of privileged information, or they leaked privileged information about potential mergers and acquisitions involving Amaya inc.” The Quebec regulator also alleges that they enriched themselves by around CA$1.5 million ($1.13 million) between 2011 and 2016.

The dates are significant in that they imply that the alleged insider trading predates the Rational Group Acquisition; 2011 was the year that Amaya announced its first major takeover, of software company Chartwell, and later Canadian online gaming pioneer Cryptologic.
Telemarketing Scam
In the mid-nineties, Josh Baazov fell afoul of the Washington-based Federal Trade Commission’s “Project Jackpot,” which was charged with targeting telemarketing scams offering phony prizes, according to Canada’s Globe and Mail.
The FTC accused Josh Baazov’s company of tricking US senior citizens into buying hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise in return for the promise of valuable prizes, none of which ever materialized.
In 1997, a federal judge ordered “Josh Baazov and Ofer Baazov” to pay $777,000 in restitution to the company’s victims, apparently believing that Josh and Offer were two separate people. The Globe and Mail discovered in June last year that not a cent of this has ever been paid.
In the same report, the newspaper suggests that Josh Baazov may have been involved with the founding of Amaya, along with his brother. It notes that one Albert Jan, with whom David Baazov once ran a tanning salon called “Celebrity Tan,” claims on LinkedIn that he worked at Amaya from 2004 to 2006 “with David and Josh Baazov founder [sic] of Amaya Gaming.”
The gaming operator denies that Josh Baazov has ever “been an Amaya employee” and “to the best of the company’s knowledge, is not, and never has been, an Amaya shareholder.”
To be fair, online resumés are not traditionally the most trustworthy of documents, and Jan’s use of the singular “founder” and lack of clarifying punctuation renders the statement ambiguous.
 Was Josh Baazov in Amaya or Not?
But the Globe and Mail kept on digging, and found several instances in which Josh Baazov’s name pops up in relation to Amaya’s affairs.
Between 2005 and 2006, he met with a Canadian casino official, seeking advice about how to supply electronic poker tables to the casino industry. He was hawking a product called PokerMate, which later became Amaya’s proprietary product.
He also appears to have been involved in finding potential investors for Amaya in the late noughties, and as late as 2011 was mentioned by Chilean casino officials as being one of two “representatives” from Amaya who offered them a presentation of the company’s gambling products.
The online edition of the Dominican Republic’s Listin Diaro, dated November 21, 2012, shows a photograph of him offering a similar presentation in Santo Domingo, along with Craig Levett, who was also named by AMF as one of the 13 suspects yesterday.
Levett is a longtime business partner of both Baazov brothers, and was an initial investor in the tanning salon that would one day morph into one of the biggest online gaming companies in the world.
Both Josh Baazov and Levett have declined to respond to the Globe and Mail’s request for comment.

From the beginning Josh and Craig were in Cybertronix before changed name to Amaya:
Josh Baazov 55%
Craig Levett 20%
David Baazov 15%
Albert Jann 5%
Cedric Caron 5%
Look into Quebec companies name change from Cybertronix to Amaya, Craig Levett registered there as Secretary.

Amaya CEO David Baazov  has previously denied allegations that he was “the main source” of privileged information used by several other people to make nearly $1.5 billion in profit from stock trades.

  (Graham Hughes / THE CANADIAN PRESS Images)  By The Canadian PressTues., March 29, 2016MONTREAL—David Baazov is taking an indefinite, paid leave of absence as CEO and chairman of Amaya Inc., owner of the PokerStars online gambling business.The company says Baazov is taking the leave voluntarily to focus on his response to allegations against him by Quebec’s stock market regulator and to prepare an offer to buy Amaya.Baazov faces five charges, including influencing or attempting to influence the market price of the securities of Amaya and communicating privileged information. He has denied the accusations and said he is confident he will be found innocent of the charges.“As always, I continue to be dedicated to doing the right thing for Amaya and all its stakeholders,” Baazov said in a statement Tuesday.“I believe that stepping down in the short term will help to avoid distraction for the company and its management while I vigorously contest all allegations made against me and pursue my bid to acquire the company.”Article Continued BelowBaazov was charged last week along with two other people and three companies following an investigation by the Autorite des marches financiers (AMF) into alleged insider trading.The AMF also announced last Wednesday that it executed search warrants and obtained court orders to stop the activities of 13 people who traded in different securities while in possession of privileged information. The 13 people are alleged to have used their access to information to reap nearly $1.5 million in profit from stock trades.The company said Baazov’s role as CEO will be assumed on an interim basis by Rafi Ashkenaz, who is currently CEO of the Rational Group, Amaya’s operating business that includes the PokerStars and Full Tilt brands.The role of chairman of Amaya’s board will be assumed by Divyesh (Dave) Gadhia, who has been a director since 2010 and chairs the committee of independent directors that would evaluate any takeover proposal from Baazov.In announcing Baazov’s leave, Amaya said the special committee headed by Gadhia has instructed its financial adviser, Barclays Capital Canada, to begin contacting other parties who might be interested in a transaction involving Amaya. The committee is also negotiating with certain parties that might gain access to confidential information.“The special committee has not made a determination as to whether a sale of Amaya is in the best interests of the company at this time. The special committee will consider any offer made by Mr. Baazov and any expressions of interests made by third parties if and when any such offers or expressions of interest are made.”Based on Monday’s closing stock price, Amaya had a market value of just under $2 billion — well below what it was in early February when Baazov first indicated publicly that he was interested in buying out other shareholders.At the time, Amaya said Baazov had informally indicated he would pay $21 per share in cash, which was 40 per cent above the pre-announcement price of $14.99. The stock rose in the following weeks to as high as $21.82 on March 3 but has since given up the gains and closed Monday at $14.81.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

12 Nov 2015 - 17:05ElsewhereAmaya's David Baazov confirms BetStars brand









 David Baazov, CEO of Amaya Inc, has confirmed that subsidiary PokerStars will launch a sports betting product under the brand BetStars.com
The confirmation by Baazov follows last weekend’s speculation that Amaya Inc. was preparing to launch a sports betting focused product, having acquired multiple domain names connected to the brand term BetStars.com.
Presenting 1Q35 performance figures, Baazov detailed that Amaya had delayed its decision to rollout a sportsbook in 2015, with the operator choosing to improve its platform and overall sports betting inventory.
The much anticipated BetStars.com will aim to launch in the multiple European markets by 16H1. Amaya governance stated that the operator would continue to diversify its product range as the company looks to reduce its dependence on online poker as its principal revenue generator.
Tuesday’s investor call saw Amaya lower its 2015 profit guidance by 10 percent, having missed 15Q3 earnings expectations. The firm detailed that it had been impacted by currency declines relative to a stronger US dollar.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Amaya's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Conference Call.
This afternoon, Amaya issued an earnings press release and filed its audited consolidated financial statements, MDNA and annual information form on EDGAR and SEDAR and its Form 40-F annual report on Edgar. These documents and webcast presentation, will also be available on or through Amaya's website at www.amaya.com.

Moreover presentation of certain of these measures has provided for year-over-year comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the affect of the adjustments thereto provided herein have an actual effect on Amaya's operating results.

David Baazov
Thank you, operator. I'd like to apologize in advance for delay, which was due to exceptionally high volume and level of interest for the call. So I wanted to give people a chance to dial-in.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating on today's call and webcast. Please note a copy of our accompanying presentations available to webcast link provided in our earnings press release issued today. It will also be posted to our website.
I'm joined on the call today by Daniel Sebag our Chief Financial Officer.
Our fourth quarter performance demonstrated that the business is operationally strong and our brands are delivering on a sound strategy for growing the business through multiple gaming verticals, particularly through the strength of our emerging real-money online casino offerings and maintaining a market leading high quality consumer experience in our core online poker business.
The fourth quarter capped a year in which the business faced multiple challenges, some expected and others not. It showed very strong resilience, highlighting the underlying quality of our fundamentals. We generated strong and recurring cash flow. Have a dominant market share in poker. Are showing strong momentum in key new growth businesses particularly real money online casino games and are leveraging our proven ability to bring in new customers while engaging our broad customer base, now over 100 million with compelling promotions, new games and strong marketing campaigns.
For example, our fourth quarter revenues increased 15% and adjusted EBITDA increased 16%. We maintained PokerStars' dominant position in the global online poker market the estimated 71% share of real-money poker for a liquidity.
We attracted new players through several key promotions and marketing campaigns, including those starring global soccer stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar Junior and we'll continue to leverage these global celebrities in 2016.
We also introduced a number of initiatives designed to make poker more fun for new and existing recreational players, including through the introduction of new innovative products, revamping the VIP loyalty system and limiting third party software tools.
During the fourth quarter, real money online casino continued to grow as a proportion of our overall revenues and we believe there is more opportunity for continued growth as we begin customer acquisition marketing and let to expand the base of players to whom real money online casino is available.
Casino had over 440,000 quarterly active unique playing in our casino games in the fourth quarter and we believe our online casino is among the world's fastest growing with one of the largest player bases among our competitors.
We introduced our SportsBook offering during 2015 and launched the BetStars brand in 2016. While certain development constraints resulted in rolling out the offerings slower than originally anticipated, in Q4 2015 we had approximately 131,000 quarterly active uniques.
In 2016 we began launching marketing initiatives primarily in the U.K. and plan to introduce BetStars to more geographies in the European including France and Italy and to increase the number of sports available for betting.

On the regulatory front we obtained new gaming licenses or approvals to operate in several jurisdictions, including New Jersey and increased the sustainability of our revenue base. We also started paying gaming duties or related VAT in five additional ER jurisdictions bringing our total to 15. We became a pure play BUC operator, by completing the divestiture of our B2B business for solid returns.
In 2015, we reduced our total debt by approximately US$569 million and reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 5%. We're pleased with these results and the performance of the business, notwithstanding significant headwinds that impacted revenue and profitability such as the levy of certain V18 gaming duties, the suspension or impairment of real money operations in certain jurisdictions and currency fluctuations.
Despite the challenges, our 2015 performance showed growth and momentum in many of our KPIs. The fourth quarter of 2015, customer registrations increased by two million to approximately 99 million. As if to date the aggregate customer registrations exceeded 100 million.
Our overall quarterly active uniques were over 2.4 million, a decline of approximately 2% over Q4 2014, with growth on PokerStars of approximately 1%, primarily offset by a decline in Full Tilt.
However, excluding the effect of suspected or impaired jurisdictions, active uniques on PokerStars increased by approximately 4% and overall uniques by approximately 1%.
Our quarterly net yield, which represents our real money gaming revenue per quarterly active unique increased 17% year-over-year to $153 million. Due to foreign exchange fluctuations, however on a U.S. dollar basis, the total was $113, a decrease of 2% year-over-year.
On a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, total quarterly net yield was US$134 representing an increase of 15% year-over-year. The growth in quarterly net yield on a constant currently basis was primarily attributable to the rollout of the PokerStar's real money online casino product.
Danny will now walk you through our 2015 fourth quarter and annual financial performance and additional detail.
Daniel Sebag
Thanks David. Before we begin, please note that the 2014 figures assumes that the acquisitions of our B2C business occurred as of January 1, 2014 and the disposition of our B2B businesses occurred as of December 31, 2013.
As lf the fourth quarter, our business had two new reporting segments, real money online poker and combined real money online casino and SportsBook. As it relates to these two segments, online revenues include revenues generated through our online, mobile and desktop playing platforms. The remaining revenue is included in other and corporate revenue.
In addition as you're aware, this past November we revised our full year 2015 guidance. We've provided a slide with a reconciliation showing that we either met or beat our revised guidance for each measure. For those measures that we beat guidance, it was primarily the result of a revaluation of our frequent player points following the implementation of the previously announced changes to our VIP structure, which positively impacted revenue by approximately $8.7 million.
In 2015, the increase in the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate had a favorable impact on our reported revenues. Our Q4 2015 revenues increased approximately 15% to approximately $319 million versus Q4 2014 revenues.
We have growth in Casino and SportsBook revenue, which offset a decline in poker revenue. Poker revenues comprised approximately 78% of total revenues, and casino and SportsBook combined revenues comprised 17% as compared to approximately 93% and 3% respectively in Q4 2014.
Our poker revenues declined 4% in Q4 2015, primarily as a result of the levy of certain value-added taxes, the previously reported suspension or impairment of certain jurisdictions, a decline in the activity on the Full Tilt platform and cannibalization from our real money online casino product.

Our Casino and SportsBook revenues increased significantly in Q4 2015, primarily as a result of the expansion of Casino under the PokerStars brand and the addition of third party slots. Our full year 2015 revenues increased 8% to $1.37 billion from full year 2014. 83% of revenue came from Poker and 13% from Casino and SportsBook.
On a geographic basis, 2015 revenues were split approximately as follows, 62% from 28 countries in the European Union, 18% from the rest of Europe, 13% from the Americas, and 7% from the rest of the world.
While our operating business generates deposits from players around the world, most notably in Europe, the game play is predominantly in U.S. dollars. Therefore, our business is impacted by fluctuations in Global currencies against the U.S. dollar.
In 2015, the purchasing power of our customer base declined significantly. We estimate the value of our customer's local currencies decline by 18%. Due to the impact of currency fluctuations on our business, we provide a constant currency comparison to show how the underlying business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
On a constant currency basis, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our Q4 2015 total revenue increased 12% versus Q4 2014 and our total revenue for 2015 increased 15% versus 2014.
Our Q4 2015 real money online poker revenue decreased 4% versus Q4 2014, while our full year 2015 poker revenue increased approximately 2% versus 2014. On a constant currency basis, we estimate the impact of VAT and certain suspended or impaired jurisdictions was 4% on total revenue and 3% on poker revenue for the quarter and full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 16% in Q4 2015, over Q4 2014, which is in line with our revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter included approximately $68 million of adjustments notably $32 million of pre-2015 Austrian gaming duty, a significantly majority of which was incurred prior to our acquisition of Rational Group and is included in the endemic claim we filed with the sellers. We have also filed the claim in Austria challenged the constitutionality of the levying.
$16 million related to the termination of certain affiliate and employment agreements and $12 million of impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA in 2015 benefited from the expansion of online Casino, but was negatively impacted by VAT as well as new gaming duties in multiple jurisdictions.
Casino provided strong EBITDA margins as we did not engage in external marketing, focusing simply on cross sell. Profits from the vertical will help support our investment in both SportsBook and our New Jersey Launch primarily through advertising and non-R&D headcount.
As we have previously noted, we intent to begin external customer acquisition efforts including through a standalone mobile casino app. Our adjusted net earnings grew 27% to $111 million in Q4 2015, versus Q4 2014, reflecting the increase in adjusted EBITDA and the reduction of interest expense.
Adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.53 in Q4 2015, versus $0.43 in Q4 2014. For the full year 2015, adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $1.76 versus $1.53 in 2014. In Q4 2015, we generated approximately $134 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations versus $128 million in Q4 2014, with the increase largely due to movements in the U.S. dollar to the Canadian dollar exchange rate.
In the first two months of 2016, we estimate that we have generated approximately US$189 million of revenue, representing a 4% increase over the prior period in 2015.
Of the total revenue Real Money Online Poker revenue was US$142 million, representing a 14% decrease over the prior year period and Real Money Online Casino and SportsBook revenue was US$40 million, representing a significant increase over the prior year period.

On a constant currency basis for the first two months of 2016, total revenue increased 14% while Poker revenue decreased 4%. The decline in Poker is primarily a result of customers playing through a smaller deposit base in Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015, when they had not just experienced the impact of the devaluation of their local currencies against the U.S. dollar.
Poker revenue was also impacted by cannibalization from new verticals primarily casino including more. The decline is being mitigated by improved net deposits, which are up year-over-year. We have seen other early positive results in the VIP program change including player deposits lasting longer.
As previously announced, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors determined in consultation with the audit committee that in view of the potential offer to acquire Amaya that maybe forthcoming from Mr. Baazov and the fact that the Special Committee's Financial Advisor and the independent valuator commence the review process it would be inappropriate for Amaya to provide guidance with respect to its 2016 financial performance at this time.
An analysis of management's forecast with Amaya's financial performance will be part of the valuator's work and it's report, which would include certain forecast information would be made public as part of any disclosure document relating to any offer.
With that said, note that Amaya is not otherwise precluded from providing 2016 financial guidance in the future.
I will now turn the call over to David.
David Baazov
Thank you, Danny. Although challenges remain, we're confident that the company can deliver in 2016. As it relates to our core poker offerings, PokerStar is finalizing testing of its gaming platform with the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and expect to launch Real Money Online Poker and casino to customers in New Jersey beginning next week.
This is an eagerly awaited milestone for the company and by New Jersey customers. While New Jersey remains a small segregated market, we consider it a significant milestone for PokerStars and for online gaming in the United States and it delivers and one of the promises made by us when we acquire the brand in August of 2014.
Through targeted investments in marketing and customer acquisition initiatives, primarily during peak seasons beginning in 2016, we intent for PokerStars to become one of the leading online gaming sites in the New Jersey regulated market.
In addition, as Danny just noted, we're encouraged by the early results that have previously announced changes to our poker offering. Net deposits are up year-over-year and our new players deposits are lasting longer.
PokerStars plans to continue to make other changes to the site to enhance the experience of new and recreational players including among other initiatives efforts to prevent data mining and player targeting and continuing to develop new products and features that attract and retain customers.
As we have previously noted we plan to reinvest any savings from the changes to our VIP royalty program in an effort to attract, engage and retain customers such as through marketing campaigns, R&D and continued efforts to promote online gaming in new and emerging jurisdictions.
As it relates to our emerging online casino offerings, we're very pleased with the continued progress with the PokerStar's casino vertical, which has shown very strong growth in 2015. This growth continue to come strictly from organic traffic and cross sell, even with many of the best known and in demand games.
Already this year, the PokerStars' casino has added a number of new games and will continue to integrate with many of the leading license game suppliers in the industry.
BetStars our new sport betting brand is in investment mode and as we add new sports and launch new and innovative offerings including spinning bet, which we believe is an attractive innovation that will spark the interest and excitement of new and existing customers.

In the first two months of 2016, we estimate that Casino and BetStars' combined represented 21% of revenues, demonstrating the initial popularity of these offerings without fully marketing them outside of our own customer base.
In addition to growth in our online gaming operations, we continuously strive to maintain our position as an industry leader by efficiently and effectively deploying resources in our day-to-day operations. We believe that the recently announced plan to migrate the Full Tilt brand and players over the PokerStar's platform will improve player liquidity, increase the capacity of our development team and reduce duplicative cost and overall enhance the customer experience.
For 2016, we expect to continue to drive consumer excitement and plan to focus on, among other things continued and sustainable growth of our core product offerings, closing existing product apps, bringing innovative products to the markets, providing the best possible player experience across all offerings and continuing to grow our customer base with quality marketing and promotions.
We're confident that we have the management, the people and the products to take advantage of market and vertical opportunities for many years to come and as the CEO of Amaya, I approach everyday fueled by my passion to continue to build Amaya into the global leader in online gaming and aggressively pursue our growth strategies.
I continue to focus on fulfilling my duties to the company and its shareholders, including with respect to the operations and further strategic development of the company.
Now that I have settled a Special Committee, the process for my bid, including the framework for the company to share its confidential information externally, I'm going to position to move towards submitting a proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of Amaya consistent with my previously announce intensions.
Before we open the line for questions, please note that at the direction of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors I will not be addressing any questions relating to my potential offer to acquire the company.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open.
Chad Beynon
Hi, guys good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. How are you? I wanted to start off with casino, you mentioned that non-poker for 2016 quarter to date is 21%, that’s impressive and the uniques that you gave in the fourth quarter in casino I think were also kind of ahead of expectations.
Could you give us a little bit better sense of where you are with casino from a jurisdictional standpoint and then also kind of a mobile standpoint just some more kind of highlights on where we need to go before you really start marketing towards kind of a new audience? How is left on, on the bone here? Thanks.
David Baazov
So I would say that from an exposure perspective Chad, just over 50% as in the two previous Qs. However more games were added to mobile. So platform availability of games is getting better.
We do have more jurisdictions to launch such as New Jersey and the re-launch in Portugal and some other smaller jurisdictions, but as we've said casino will be available to 50% to 60% of our player base primarily in the EU. There is also some growth coming from, we're adding it to our Mac client, continue to integrate more games on to mobile which is obviously a very important channel. 
And we've just recently added progressive slots and I’d say intend to integrate many more games from Tier 1 content providers that are going to be expanded through our geographic base. And lastly I would say we're planning to do external customer acquisition, which will be attracting casino first players as well.

Chad Beynon
Any acquisition in the marketing that should commence in the second half of the year or has that started in the second quarter any help there?
David Baazov
I would say that digital marketing will likely start first and that could be as early as, in the next few months and I would say that when it comes to television etcetera, some of the productions that will probably be second half likely.
Chad Beynon
Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up just a broad question around poker legislation globally, we’ve seen some articles during the past quarter with respect to Russia, Brazil, Canada etcetera. Any updates you can provide there in terms of what you're seeing and what your expectations are from a jurisdictional standpoint? Thanks.
David Baazov
As it relates to Russia, the recent announcements are primarily related to SportsBook, which we do not operate in Russia nor do we operate casino and in terms of poker we remain optimistic at the chance for more movement on the regulation of online poker and our stance is the same for it to happen this year.
As it relates to some of the other markets i.e. Brazil, the Senate is moving on a bill and we are optimistic there as well and are likely lobbing for it to move ahead. I’d say that as relates to Portugal we're aiming for a Q3 re-launch now subject to license approval and as it relates to I would say some of Asia or India, we’re trying to develop a strategy for penetration but there is nothing to update there at this time.
Chad Beynon
Okay. Great. Best of luck.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Eyal Ofir from Dundee Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Eyal Ofir
Thanks. Just excuse me of the background noise here, I just want to follow up on your comments at the end of your commentary basically on the bid, in terms of your ability now to submit your bid, is that the rational there of taking this as long as you need to see the financial -- audited financials come out or was there another reason for it?
David Baazov
I couldn’t share any information externally Eyal, and that's all I could really comment.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. That’s fine and you can’t comment about timing either?
David Baazov
I could not, no.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. Thanks. Now moving on to the fundamentals of the business, can you just talk about in terms of what you’re seeing right now in the Casino side? You said, you’re going to go into external marketing, are you seeing some casino-only players on your side already or is it primarily Poker -- primary poker players playing casino and same question -- sorry…
David Baazov
Let’s say right now, we’re seeing approximately 2% of our player base being casino-only players.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. And that's the total player base or is that 2% of the casino?
David Baazov
2% of the Q4 quarterly active uniques there.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. Perfect. And then on the sports betting side, obviously more bigger push into Q1 and obviously throughout 2016, in terms of marketing initiatives there and also what you’re seeing today, can you just talk about the expectation of the ramp and also how should we think about new products coming out and as you progress throughout the year, how should we expect that ramp to go?
David Baazov
In terms of exposure our SportsBook in terms of BetStars is approximately is about 40% by the end of the year and we still have some larger jurisdictions to go, which will get us closer to casino of our active players being in jurisdictions where SportsBook is available primarily in the EU and some of these include Denmark, Italy, France, Portugal and they're subject to license approval.
And I would also add as it relates to BetStars, our active uniques making sports bet have been trending higher and as I said on the call SportsBook is in investment mode. We have a good team now of about 75 excluding those working on development.

It’s a competitive market. We’re making investments in marketing to get brand recognition. It’s important in SportsBook. 2016 marketing is a lot about getting the brand awareness out there and we need to invest again recognition among betters and it won’t be as fast as casino as it's a competitive market everywhere and brand is very important.
Eyal Ofir
Okay. Thanks. There are more follow-ups about [casino], I will come back.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Ralph Garcea from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Ralph Garcea
Good evening, gentlemen. Maybe just a follow up on the first two months of this year number on casino and SportsBook, can you give us between the two or I guess is the SportsBook revenue greater than $5 million?
David Baazov
I will tell you, Ralph, I'll tell you, SportsBook was just a few million dollars.
Ralph Garcea
Okay. And you have a full rollouts, not full rollouts but in France and Italy and some of the other EU countries before the Euro Championship this summer?
David Baazov
That is our plan.
Ralph Garcea
And then on the sponsorship I guess later on, would you look to sponsor Premier League teams come the fall of 2016 to accelerate some of that non-digital marketing seeing your other competitors have Premier League sponsors?
David Baazov
We find to be I would say, rather expensive and would measure the ROI by a lot closer in terms of what we’re getting for it at this time.
Ralph Garcea
I see and then just lastly before you said as the U.S. market progresses over the next three to five years, you saw poker hit double in size if everything were to roll out on a state-by-state basis, do you still think you can double that poker market in five years if the U.S. unfolds as you think it should?
David Baazov
Yes Ralph when I made that comment, it doesn’t just represent the U.S. It also represented geographic expansion that I would say would include Asia, which we would like to see happen as well. And I would say that if you had Asian expansion as well as U.S. expansion, yes I do believe that that could happen.
Ralph Garcea
And then just lastly on mobile, I noted you just started rolling it out on the Casino side, can you give a percentage of the Casino revenue and the SportsBook that was for mobile?
David Baazov
Yes, I will say that, so above 45% of PokerStars real money uniques and mobile and social channels are continuing to grow as a percentage of registration. I would say that if the question is specific in terms of percentage or breakdown. Is that the question?
Ralph Garcea
Yeah on the mobile side?
David Baazov
Yes, so about 40% of casino revenue is mobile and about 13% of poker revenue is our mobile and I would say that sports is representing approximately slightly below 40%.
Ralph Garcea
Yes and I guess it might be dependent on your bid, but if you had a chance to accelerate your market share grab on the SportsBook side, would you consider doing an acquisition through 2016 or do you think you have the product with a full rollout and 40% penetration or exposure to that base to get a meaningful market share on the SportsBook side?
David Baazov
Yes Ralph I would say in independent of any bid, we always look at M&A opportunities, I would say opportunistically and that wouldn’t change, but I think the company is focused on organic growth.
Ralph Garcea
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Maher Yaghi
Yes, thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask you on the Poker revenues in the quarter, the decline of 2.8% year-on-year, what would that be in constant currency?
David Baazov
For which period? Are we talking about for Q4?
Maher Yaghi
Q4 yes Q4.
David Baazov
Yes, so in the presentation, I pointed to the slide I believe it’s Slide 10 on a constant currency basis, you would see that the decrease is 4%.

Maher Yaghi
4% in constant currency. So basically no big difference between the constant currency numbers that you reported the results in Canadian dollars and in constant currency that you have in Poker.
David Baazov
Correct because the Canadian dollar gained strength through the quarter. The Canadian dollar weakened in Q4.
Maher Yaghi
But it seems only slightly? Because in terms of reported results in Canadian dollars you had a decline of 3.8% year-on-year in Canadian dollars and you’re telling me in constant currency it declined by 4%, so practically no difference.
David Baazov
Yes exactly. For the quarter specifically, the Canadian dollar moved in a manner similar to the back of the currencies for Q4 and that's why you won’t see a difference.
Daniel Sebag
I think the other difference is just clear on a constant currency excluding VAT and excluded jurisdictions you would see it flat on a year-over-year basis.
Maher Yaghi
Okay. Great. Now I turn my attention a little bit on your adjustments during the quarter, you stated a few of them but I’m trying to just understand what are the other non-recurrent cost, the $39 million that you adjusted for in Q4?
Daniel Sebag
So in it, the largest item is Austria gaming duty, which relates to gaming duty of prior periods. During the year that was about $31.7 million of Austrian gaming duty that related to 2015 gaming duty. So that was adjusted out.
Another large component to that amount is we have lobbying cost of about $3.6 million, which are non-U.S. lobbying for various jurisdictions, which I believe non-recurring by the company.
We also have a retention bonus that was inherited when we acquired the company that was in many options that were paid out to the legacy employees, PokerStars over a period of time and that was about $2.87 million and that accounts for the vast majority of the $39 million.
Maher Yaghi
Great. Great and impairment the $11 million impairment charge, what is that for?
David Baazov
The $11 million impairment charge, the biggest aspect of the impairment charge has to do with the Nova assets, so we have an investment in an associate that was impaired during the period -- during the year.
Maher Yaghi
Okay. Thank you. And okay so I just had a question also, it’s not related to David’s intentions, but maybe I think you guys can answer this question, but in your first lien credit agreement under Article 7, Section 701, for eventually space that change of control with count as default event and the definition of change of control, it says any changes that other than permitted holders would own more than 35% of the voting power of the ordinary voting stock entitled to vote for the Election of the Board of Directors.
Can you clarify what this exact theory means? Does it include all options, warrants, outstanding converts etcetera and can you may be just clarify this clause?
David Baazov
You are referencing the right provision, but unfortunately we cannot get into it at this time.
Maher Yaghi
Just for general understanding of the provision, this is a document that was filed by the company and not pertaining to any forthcoming bid or anything just trying to understand what this split means exactly?
David Baazov
Were you asking about the structure?
Maher Yaghi
Well, exactly what counts into the 35%.
David Baazov
I couldn’t answer that because you're asking what is the structure essentially of the Bet Group and I can comment on that.
Maher Yaghi
Okay. And in terms of the -- as an ongoing business, can you talk a little bit about what is your expected 2016 debt repayment amount?
David Baazov
Yes, the principle would be about -- principle amortization would be approximately $24 million USD. So that’s the principle amortization and in Q1 2017, at March 31, we'll have to pay 50%,. 25% to 50% of the excess cash flow sweep depending on leverage ratios.

Maher Yaghi
Okay. Now in terms of finally just one last question, in terms of the Full Tilt combination that you guys are planning to have, what is your expectation about the impact of that change on liquidity? I guess the liquidity it would be a positive for both type of players.
But in terms of any kind of revenues that was generated by the same players on both accounts that now you could have some limitation on potentially getting if you're combining both accounts together? Is there any risk in losing some revenues when you combine these assets?
David Baazov
I would say that there is definitely a possibility. I would say that the brand is going to maintain a lot of look and feel of the existing offering and some of the current features, but I think that the benefits of the added liquidity far outweigh that as well as from a corporate perspective increasing the capacity of R&D team in terms of developers will far outweigh that.
Maher Yaghi
Can you talk about the cost synergies that you can get from these from this combination? How should we model a little bit your operating expenses given this change?
David Baazov
So we couldn’t comment I’d say that at this time in terms of quantifying it exactly, but what I could say is there is a number of duplicative costs and there will be some savings.
Maher Yaghi
Is that material or not so much?
David Baazov
I wouldn’t say its material.
Maher Yaghi
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
And there are no further audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
David Baazov
I'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call. We certainly appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest and support of Amaya. Thank you, and goodbye.
