Why Franchising is Going Global
Posted by sandro on 9:56 pm in News | Comments Off on Why Franchising is Going Global

 
 
Why Franchising is Going Global Taking a franchise brand international is, in a sense, the final frontier for growth. It’s where many franchise brands that have begun – and been successful – in the U.S turn when they seek expansion. It’s a strategy that often occurs in part because of growth that has saturated domestic markets and territories. Typically, larger more established franchise brands begin looking across borders for untapped markets and potential growth. It’s an expansion strategy that’s not new. But during the past couple of decades as franchising has continued to grow as a popular business model, the international growth strategy has been on the rise. International franchising can also provide opportunities for new and existing franchisees looking for expansion options. There are opportunities as near as Mexico and Canada and as far as the Middle East. In one sense, international franchising can be a relatively smooth and easy process. After all, the franchise concept is built around infrastructure, simplicity, replication, and streamlined operations. What works in one place generally works in another. And many international markets are wide open and untapped and offer enormous potential for franchisors – with the right products, services, and business culture. Consider this, eighty percent of the world’s population lives in areas that are considered emerging markets. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that over 75 percent of the expected growth in the world’s trade over the next two decades will come from developing countries, particularly big emerging markets, which account for over half the world’s population, but only 25 percent of its gross domestic product. Nevertheless, there are challenges for franchisors that seek expanding kingdoms in other lands – and often for the franchisees who operate the units. Franchisors look at key markers such as what kind of demand exists for their products and services in the new international market(s), the initial cost of entry, sourcing supplies and related vendor issues, and whether or not it makes sense to open company and franchise units in these new territories. Franchisors are going to evaluate a country’s GDP per capita, general population statistics, and the overall health of the country’s economy. Another significant factor affecting international expansion, laws often vary from country to country on small business operations and franchise licensing. It can be complicated and requires research. Franchise representatives need to visit the countries they are considering moving into and devote time and resources to studying these cultures very carefully. One of the first questions to consider is time of entry. One school of thought says not to be the first to the market but a close second. This way another franchisor, essentially, invests in the market research for all competitors. If the product or service flies, and the market is proved to be viable and economically attractive, then other brands, and concepts, can begin to move in. One of the most critical components of successful international franchise expansion is finding the right partners. This is a key ingredient to long-term success and profitability for the franchise brand. There’s likely to be cultural barriers, political barriers, legal barriers, language barriers, and a hodge podge of other factors that differ from standard U.S. operations. That’s why it’s important to identify key people on the ground who know and understand all of these...

Why You Should Do Business in Mexico
Posted by ryan on 4:32 pm in Blog, News | Comments Off on Why You Should Do Business in Mexico
We found this great article from American Express about why now is the time to be expanding your business into Mexico. We will be conducting a 1-Day CEO Bootcamp on June 4, 2015 in San Diego and we’ll be talking about this exact subject in much more detail. Click Here to Learn more about our 1-Day CEO Bootcamp Source: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/why-you-should-do-business-in-mexico/ By Katie Morell Entrepreneurs with a touch of wanderlust are looking to Mexico as a viable business location, and for smart reasons. Elizabeth Helsley fell in love with Mexico while on a yearlong college study abroad trip to Mexico City. After graduating in 2001, she went back home and worked in San Diego until a U.S.-based company relocated her back to Mexico City. She was thrilled with the opportunity, so much so that in 2010 she left the company and started her international consulting business Global Luxe in Guadalajara. “I get up and am excited to go to work every day,” she beams. Entrepreneurs like Helsley with a touch of wanderlust are looking to Mexico as a viable business location, and for smart reasons. First: while the rest of the world reels from financial meltdown, Mexico’s economy is going strong. “After the crisis of 2008, Mexico proved to be very stable,” says Mauricio Monroy, president of the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce California Regional Chapter. “We had a similar situation in the late ’90s and since then, our banks have gotten healthy and diversified, so we are nicely insulated from what the rest of the world is going through.” Second: the exchange rate. At press time, 1 USD was equivalent to around 12 Mexican pesos. This is good for Mexico, as the peso has historically been worth much less. The result: “It is cheaper for Mexicans to buy U.S. products and services,” he says. Third: the lack of culture shock on the part of Mexican consumers. American products, advertising and services are commonplace in Mexico, making it that much easier for U.S.-born entrepreneurs to launch a business inside the country. Fourth: U.S. companies can establish a presence in Mexico and stay owned and managed by U.S. nationals. “In many other countries, you have to hire a local employee,” Monroy says. “Here, it’s not hard to start a business—you need $3,000 pesos for an LLC and $50,000 pesos to form a corporation.” But before you book a flight heading south, it’s also important to consider some of the differences that might accompany setting up your business in Mexico. What you need to start a business in Mexico Monroy suggests doing a few things before making the move, including a marketing survey. “You need to make sure your product or service will be well received in Mexico,” he says. “I recommend talking to chamber of commerces, business organizations and economic development organizations. You can pay them to conduct surveys for you.” Then it is off to do the paperwork of setting up a business. Mexico has a variety of business launch requirements—from licensing to permitting fees—and it’s important to make sure you have everything covered. Not sure where to look? Try the local economic development corporation or hire a notario publico. Helsley chose to do the latter. “A notary in Mexico is not the same as a notary in the U.S.,” she says. “Here, it is a high-level, special position. Every...

Top 5 Reasons Your Product Will Get Stuck at the Mexico Border
Posted by ryan on 10:22 am in News | Comments Off on Top 5 Reasons Your Product Will Get Stuck at the Mexico Border
Anyone who has had to deal with Mexican authorities, either on a personal or business basis, will have had experience of how concerned they are with having paperwork in order. Hispanic countries seem to take documentation to whole new level, and Mexico is no different. Each i must be dotted, and each t crossed. When you are about to export goods to Mexico, you should prepare for an administrative and logistics minefield. You will need to present comprehensive documentation to support the import of your goods, and the distribution within Mexico’s borders. Any discrepancies or deficiencies in the paperwork and your goods will be seized and held until the problem areas are resolved to the satisfaction of the Mexican Importation Laws, which are administered by the General Customs Administration. Before your product crosses into Mexico, imported goods need to stop and be unloaded at a receiving warehouse on the US side. What I mean is, that your truck can not drive right across the border, deliver the product and drive back over the border. But it’s before even loading your goods onto the truck, or into the hold of a ship or plane, that the problems with importation could begin. The top five reasons your goods might get stuck at the Mexican border range from the temporary to the almost indefinite. 1) Your goods are miss-classified All of your goods will need to be classified for import duty payments. The documentation must conform to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), and this includes identifying them as NAFTA or non NAFTA imports. Underneath this classification comes a sub-classification by industry. The goods to be imported must be annotated as to the industry for which they are being imported, as this, too, will have an impact on duties payable. Once at customs for clearing, the professional customs expert cannot change the classification details. It is up to the exporter/ importer to ensure the classification paperwork is in order, and though this can often be done online, it is a lengthy process. You will need to provide proof of the payment of any import duties and taxes payable. These might include IVA (VAT), customs processing fees, warehouse fees, and special taxes on production and services. All goods must be marked with country of origin stamps or stickers, and be imported with a certificate or origin. Imports from NAFTA countries may be free from importation taxes. 2) Your goods are mis-valued The valuation you place upon your goods on the importation documentation will determine the duties to be paid (if any). Of course, the country of origin will also impact these duties payable. If, upon inspection of the paperwork or the goods themselves, the Customs officer believes that the goods have been undervalued (whether deliberately or mistakenly), then the goods will be held whilst checks are made. These checks may include internet searches for similar goods, and phoning the supplier to ensure price charged is the correct valuation. This is not only on the exporter end, it is also a problem found with importers, where the importer needs to attach valuation paperwork and undervalues for avoidance of tax and duties. Mexican and American authorities work closely together to ensure that there is a good knowledge of the origin of goods and valuation of goods...

3 Things You Absolutely need to do before start selling in Mexico.
Posted by ryan on 10:07 am in News | Comments Off on 3 Things You Absolutely need to do before start selling in Mexico.
There are any number of great reasons to sell your products to Mexico. Mexico has a robust and growing economy and a thriving middle class. And, the median age in Mexico is 27 years old – an open-minded target marketready to adapt to new brands, new experiences and new products. They have a lifetime of consumption ahead of them with anticipated larger disposable incomes – a perfect market to introduce YOUR products to NOW. Consider that Mexico is one of the most ‘open to trade’ countries in the world and has an economy larger than Canada, Korea or Spain. Combine that with an economy that’s booming and a sophisticated import infrastructure designed to support businesses that export to Mexico. Take a close look at the potential and you’ll quickly see the advantage to your bottom line. Mexico represents market share you can’t afford to ignore. You can get the new business, or your competitors can. With so much new business to be had, exploring the idea of doing business in Mexico is a no-brainer. Of course, crossing the border means dealing with government regulations – ours and theirs. It’s not complicated, but you must be compliant. Not just because it’s the law – though that obviously matters – but because it can cost you time and money and you can’t afford to waste either. Here are three things you absolutely need to do before you start selling to Mexico. 1. You Must Register Your Trademark in Mexico Registering, and protecting your trademark in Mexico is a must when doing business in Mexico. Having your trademark registered in the U.S. or Canada DOES NOT means you have legal rights to that trademark in Mexico. If you don’t register your trademark, you’re not prohibited from using it, but you could very easily lose it to someone else who decides to register it – they can do so legally if you have not. Avoid costly litigation and potential headaches by registering your trademark BEFORE you export your goods to Mexico. It can be a long and costly process to defend your trademark, so it’s better to be prepared in advance. It’s like that old adage about closing the barn door after the horse has escaped – it doesn’t get the horse back! It’s easy to access the Mexican government trademark databases to make sure your company or brand name(s) are not already in use, and haven’t been registered or applied for. Typically, the entire trademark process – application to approval – takes about 12 months. Once your application is approved, your trademark is protected for ten years and can be renewed for new ten year periods an unlimited number of times. 2. You Must Comply with Mexican Product Labeling Requirements Mexican law requires that all consumer products display accurate and detailed labeling information so that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions. Mexican law clearly defines the minimum information required for various products and of course, prohibits making false or misleading claims on any product. Mandatory information includes product name, net quantity contained and manufacturer and/or distributor identity information as well as the origin of the product. This must all be done in Spanish. Note that goods must be properly labeled to pass through customs. Avoid costly delays by having correct labels prepared...

3 Things You Absolutely need to do before start selling in Mexico.

Be aware that there are labeling requirements for your shipping boxes and containers as well and compliance will make it easy to move your goods smoothly across the border.
3. You Need to Have the Correct HS Classification Numbers for Your Products
HS stands for Harmonized System and is an internationally recognized system used to classify products so they can be easily identified by any country.  Export codes are six digits and categories of products are then subcategorized with an additional four numbers, creating a ten number HS classification.
For example, the category of computers might have a six digit code: 123456 and a laptop, a subcategory, might have an additional 4 number code: 1234. Therefore, the number 123456-1234 is the HS code that allows anyone in any country to understand that you’re exporting a laptop computer. Simple and easy to understand in any language – hence the harmony!
You’ll also encounter the term Schedule B – a schedule of classification used internationally and here in the U.S. administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. By international agreement, most countries recognize the same first 6 “harmonized” digits. These are the first 6 numbers (Schedule B) and are usually adequate for export purposes.
Are you wondering adequate for what? Good question! You’ll need to know if there are any tariffs that will need to be paid or whether a product qualifies for a preferential tariff under the Free Trade Agreement. The class of goods determines appropriate tariffs.
And, your schedule B number is needed to fill out several required documents including the Shipper’s Export Declaration, Certificates of Origin as well as other necessary shipping documents.
Finally, realize that while at first glance it may seem like there’s a lot to know, perhaps a new set of rules that feels like ‘one more thing to do’ – they’re really quite simple. And, the Mexican market represents SO much potential, that learning the regulations are a small price to pay relative to the profits to be made.
Mexico is our next door neighbor and their economic growth spells your opportunity.

FAQ
Which Marketplaces Does Jungle Scout Support?Both The Web App and The Chrome Extension have full support to the following marketplaces: Germany, France, Canada, US, UK, India, Spain, Italy, MexicoWhat is the Difference Between Jungle Scout Extension and Jungle Scout Web App?The Web App is a powerful toolkit that runs in the cloud on our own website. It has a suite of three tools; an Amazon product database specifically for sellers, a product tracker and the niche hunter. In comparison the Jungle Scout Chrome Extension runs by pulling data, including estimated revenue, directly from the Amazon website as you browse it.Can I Use Jungle Scout on My Phone/iPad?Jungle Scout Web App
Even in the world we live in, where we love to do everything on our mobile devices, the online Jungle Scout web app is best viewed on a computer.  
However, we are as addicted to the web app as you are, so feel free to use it on your mobile device. The web app displays nicely on most tablets, though it is usually too much information to display in an easy-to-read format on smartphones.  
Jungle Scout Extension
We hate being the bearer or bad news but, unfortunately, Google Chrome does not support extensions on mobile devices (tablets/smartphones/ipads) at this time. 
If, in the future, Google makes Chrome extensions mobile device-compatible, we will be sure to make JSLite and JSPro available for tablets and smartphones.
For now, though, we are limited to using the JS extensions on our laptops and desktops.
Can I own both the Web App and the Chrome Extension?Definitely. Many of our customers enjoy the benefits of being able to get data at their fingertips with the Chrome Extension, as well as the ability to track products and find new niches and product ideas via the Web App.JOIN THE0AMAZON SELLERS WHO USE JUNGLESCOUT GET STARTED

Knowing Which Products are Truly Made in America
How to know which flag-waving products are true red, white, and blue
Consumer Reports magazine: February 2013 























Puzzling labels

Laws allow for patriotic symbols, as long as makers identify where a product was made.





Given a choice between a product made in the U.S. and an identical one made abroad, 78 percent of Americans would rather buy the American product, according to a new nationally representative survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.




More than 80 percent of those people cited retaining manufacturing jobs and keeping American manufacturing strong in the global economy as very important reasons for buying American. About 60 percent cited concern about the use of child workers or other cheap labor overseas, or stated that American-made goods were of higher quality.




And people would pay extra to buy American. More than 60 percent of all respondents indicated they’d buy American-made clothes and appliances even if those cost 10 percent more than imported versions; more than 25 percent said they’d pay at least an extra 20 percent. (Perhaps more surprising: According to a new survey of consumers in the U.S. and abroad by the Boston Consulting Group, more than 60 percent of Chinese respondents said they’d buy the American-made version over the Chinese even if it were to cost more.)




Clearly, most Americans want to know where products are made and want to buy those that will help create or keep jobs in the U.S.—an attempt applauded by economists like Jeff Faux, a distinguished fellow of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, in Washington, D.C. “Consumers need to understand that all jobs and wages are interconnected,” Faux told us. “When you buy foreign goods—and sometimes there’s no choice—it means that fewer U.S. workers will have the money to buy the goods and services you sell.”




But what does “made in the USA” even mean? And how can you identify what’s made where? 




In this special report, we’ll decipher labeling laws and explain why a product that pictures an American flag might be made abroad, identify companies that still make products in the U.S., hear from economists about manufacturing trends, and provide our experts’ assessment of the quality of some American-made apparel.






A guessing game

                                Tooga
                









Few products except cars, textiles, furs, and woolens are required by law to reveal their American heritage. But when any manufacturer chooses to boast of an American connection, it must comply with federal rules designed to keep consumers from being misled.




Our evidence shows that if not misled, consumers are at least confused. Readers flood Consumer Reports with letters and e-mail seeking explanations as to why, for example, frozen blueberries from Oregon are identified as a product of Chile; why a company named Florida’s Natural sells apple juice with concentrate from Brazil; why pants made in Vietnam are labeled “authentic, active, outdoor, American”; or why a T-shirt with the words “Made in the” above the U.S. flag comes from Mexico.




Though perplexing, such words and pictures don’t usually violate regulations that are issued by the Federal Trade Commission, the agency responsible for protecting consumers from false or deceptive product claims. The key factors in determining whether a “Made in the USA” claim is deceptive, says FTC senior attorney Laura Koss, are the claim’s context and whether it’s likely to mislead a reasonable consumer. Ultimately, the line between legal and illegal is determined by the overall impression planted in consumers’ minds.




But the line is blurry. Every case is different and subject to interpretation, Koss says. Most of the complaints the FTC receives are initiated by companies that are pointing a finger at competitors they claim are seeking an unfair advantage.




When a company definitely crosses the line, the FTC’s priority is stopping the behavior, not punishment. If a company refuses, it faces civil penalties—in theory. In practice, the FTC has brought only one civil penalty case since the late 1990s, slapping toolmaker Stanley with a $205,000 fine in 2006 to settle charges involving the pedigree of its Zero Degree ratchets. (Stanley claimed that the ratchets were made in America, but the FTC noted that much of their content was foreign.)









The types of claims
“Made in the USA” claims can be “unqualified” or “qualified.” Unqualified means that “all or virtually all” significant parts and processing are of U.S. origin. The product may contain a small amount of foreign ingredients if they’re not significant—the knobs of a barbecue grill, for instance. Companies must be able to document any claim.
Qualified claims, the main cause of confusion, come in many forms, but each must tell the whole story. Take the new iPad Mini. The packaging says, “Designed by Apple in California, Assembled in China.” That’s an acceptable claim. By contrast, a company could land in trouble if it said “created in the U.S.” without specifying the country of manufacture, since consumers are likely to interpret a vague, stand-alone term like “created” as all-inclusive. The FTC requires companies to post prominent, unambiguous statements (such as the actual country of origin) to leave an accurate impression.
Readers who have sent us complaints seem most irritated by foreign-made products whose makers have patriotic names (American Mills, Americana Olives, Great American Seafood, United States Sweaters, the U.S. Lock company) or whose packages have flag-waving slogans (“true American quality”) or symbols (pictures of the flag, eagle, Statue of Liberty). But all of those products are likely to be legal as long as they leave a clear impression about where they’re made.
Another type of labeling law, enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection with an assist from the Department of Agriculture, requires imported goods to bear a country-of-origin label when they enter the U.S. If an import combines materials or processing from more than one country, the agency considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a “substantial transformation” occurred—for example, the place where a computer was fabricated, not the country that supplied most parts.
The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service is responsible for administering and enforcing country-of-origin labeling of certain foods. Large retailers must use signs, labels, or stickers to identify the birthplace of covered commodities (most meat, fish, fresh or frozen fruits, vegetables, and some nuts). That’s why some brands of salmon are labeled both “wild-caught Alaskan” and “Product of Thailand.” The fish was caught in U.S. waters but took a detour to Asia to be skinned and boned (to take advantage of cheaper labor) before making its return voyage. Under the law, that side trip must be noted.
Bottom line. If you want to buy American products, these tips should help:

Read labels carefully, using the info above.
Consult websites that name companies making products in the U.S.: americansworking.com, madeinamericaforever.com, and madeinusa.org.
Contact a manufacturer directly.
Check our listing of some of the companies still manufacturing in America.










Still made in the USA

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, American manufacturing lost almost 6 million jobs between 2000 and 2010. “Offshoring” became a buzzword with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. But the more recent hemorrhaging of jobs was due in large part to China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, notes Ron Hira, associate professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. A decade of BLS data reveals heavy job losses across more than a dozen manufacturing sectors, including apparel and textiles, electrical equipment, iron and steel production, computers, glass, and leather tanning and finishing.




Why are foreign nations so appealing to manufacturers? Simple economics, for starters. In 2010, compensation costs (wages and benefits) for manufacturing jobs in the U.S. were $34.74 per hour on average, according to the BLS. That’s lower than in 13 northern and western European countries, but far higher than costs in China: $1.36 per hour (in 2008), based on BLS estimates. Another manufacturing powerhouse, India, has even lower hourly compensation costs than China.




But depending on the manufacturing sector, labor may account for only a small fraction of operating costs. So China may offer manufacturers “goodie packages” to relocate, including tax breaks, low-cost land rental, and reduced utility costs, according to Hal Sirkin, a senior partner with global-management consultants Boston Consulting Group. In exchange, U.S. companies might be required to take on local companies as business partners or cut other deals with area businesses or municipalities.

The appeal of foreign countries may wane, Sirkin says. “China gets more expensive every year. By 2015, Chinese wages will average $6.15 per hour, still well below the U.S. minimum wage, but American worker productivity is significantly higher. When you consider all the factors, the true cost to manufacture goods from China will be only about 10 percent cheaper than to make them domestically in another few years.”
National security issues and an iffy supply chain are also concerns. “Natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan can disrupt the product pipeline, leading to shortages of parts, products, and long shipping delays,” says John Hoffecker, a managing director of global business consultants AlixPartners in New York. By 2015, the Boston Consulting Group predicts, cost advantages (in electricity, natural gas, and labor) over Japan and several European countries in a range of industries will give U.S. exports a big boost. As a result, the group says, the U.S. could add as many as 2.5 million to 5 million manufacturing jobs by the end of the decade.
Jeff Faux, a distinguished fellow of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., is not sanguine about the nature of those jobs. “When you think it through,” he says, “our default policy to compete in the global economy over the long run is to lower the wages and benefits of American workers, and no one at the top will admit that. There’s no question a few jobs are coming back. However, they’re jobs that once paid $22 per hour and are now paying $12. Globalization isn’t the problem. The problem is that we started to accelerate the opening of U.S. markets to foreign goods, but without preparing our workers for the brutalization of competition. For 30 years leaders have said we need to train and upgrade the skills of American workers, but it needs to be done before signing these trade agreements, not after the fact.”






Wolf range





Making it in America
Still, it’s a stretch to say, as is commonly heard, that the U.S. doesn’t make anything anymore. In fact, Sirkin says, the U.S. makes about three-quarters of all the manufactured goods (including components) it consumes. The chemical and plastics industries are thriving, thanks to declining natural gas prices, and foreign automakers including BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, and Volkswagen have opened plants in the U.S. Master Lock returned (“onshored” or   “insourced” in labor-speak) 100 union jobs to its Milwaukee lock factory. Among the companies that have dug in their heels and continued to manufacture domestically is Lenox, which says it’s the only maker of fine bone china in the U.S.
Some companies are bucking the outsourcing trend even in industries that have largely fled the U.S.: large appliances, electronics, and apparel.
Appliances. In 2000, Michigan-based Whirlpool manufactured most of its front-loading washers in Germany. Now the company is in the midst of making a five-year, $1 billion investment in U.S.-based plants, facilities, and equipment. Of the products Whirlpool sells in the U.S., it makes 80 percent in U.S. plants. And it continues to ramp up production of front-loaders in Ohio, where it already makes dryers, dishwashers, freezers, and top-loaders.
“On the one hand, U.S. labor costs are often higher than in other countries,” says Casey Tubman, Whirlpool’s general manager of cleaning. “But when you look at the higher productivity for American workers and consider the fact that it’s very expensive to ship something as big as a refrigerator or washer, we can quickly make up those costs.”
Last year, KitchenAid returned the manufacture of hand mixers from China to the U.S., and GE opened two factories in Kentucky to make hot-water heaters and refrigerators. A spokesman for Sears told us that “through our manufacturing partner, Electrolux, more than 1,200 new American jobs will be created at a plant being built in Memphis.”
There should be plenty of demand if the industry does come back. About a third of respondents to our survey said they’d tried to buy U.S.-made appliances during the past year. And more than half of respondents perceived such appliances as having much or somewhat better quality than those made abroad.






Pendleton Portland Collection blanket





Electronics. Few TVs, cell phones, or digital cameras are made in America, but in December, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “Next year, we will do one of our existing Mac lines in the United States.” China-based Lenovo, the world’s second-largest personal computer maker, announced last October that it would start making some PCs in North Carolina, bucking a trend “that has seen electronics manufacturing jobs migrate overseas for more than two decades,” the company said. And Element Electronics, an American company, has been assembling LCD TVs in its Detroit factory since January 2012. The company says that opting for domestic production was “an emotional decision . . . maybe even a patriotic choice.”
Apparel. The domestic industry has been scorched by job losses because of plentiful and cheap labor overseas. More than 90 percent of clothes and shoes sold in America are made elsewhere, according to Jack Plunkett of Houston-based Plunkett Research. Still, the industry is gaining traction in the U.S. There’s growth among designers with output too small to attract the interest of international manufacturers, and among those who simply want to be part of a Made in America movement. And as you'll read in "American Made, But Well Made?" even some big names are offering at least a limited assortment of American-made garments and accessories.
To build on the momentum, President Obama, through the departments of Commerce and Labor, last fall launched the “Make It in America” challenge, offering $40 million in grants to applicants who come up with the best proposals to encourage “insourcing,” spur foreign investment, and expand job opportunities through employee training programs.






Close to home—mostly









Here’s a sampling of companies that make or assemble at least some of their products in the U.S. Note that a company’s entire output isn’t necessarily American-made. And some primarily American companies may have manufacturing facilities in more than one country to meet demand overseas.

Although looking for U.S.-made products is important to most Americans, our national survey found that other corporate behavior matters at least as much. We asked respondents, "All things being equal, would you be more likely, less likely, or neither to buy from a company that . . . "

American made, but well made?




 
        Respondents to our survey praised the quality of U.S.-made products: 61 percent said that U.S. clothing and shoes were of better quality than foreign goods (34 percent said “much better” and 27 percent said “somewhat better”). Just 5 percent said American-crafted clothing or shoes were of worse quality. And almost 60 percent of Americans said they had tried to buy U.S.-made clothing or shoes within the past year.

No wonder more and more companies are adding at least a few U.S.-made items to their product lines. But no product is worth your hard-earned dollars if it’s poorly made. For a snapshot of how American-made products measure up, we bought one sample of six products from big brands and asked our experts to assess their quality. Price is what we paid.

	






Brooks Brothers cotton sport shirt, $84



Made in America from long-staple Egyptian cotton woven in Italy, the fabric is smooth, strong, and unlikely to pill. (Egyptian cotton is typical in fine sheets and shirts.) Brooks Brothers sweated the small stuff, and the shirt has impeccable details: The button holes are perfect, the collar has interfacing that makes it “stand up and be noticed,” our expert said; the striped fabric on the back of the shirt lines up with the yoke, and the yoke lines up with the collar (“like a good wallpaper job,” our expert noted). There are gussets on the side of the tail and small pleats in the sleeve to help resist accidental tears. The shirt also comes with two extra buttons, one for the placket and another for the collar. Our only nitpick: a few loose threads.

 Bottom line. “It’s a well-made, high-quality shirt,” our expert said, “with features that help it resist wear and touches you’d expect from a tailor.”













Lands’ End ragg socks, $30



These thick casual socks (made in Osage, Iowa) are multicolored, as the name “ragg” implies. They’re 66 percent cotton, 28 percent wool, 5 percent nylon, and 1 percent spandex. The heel and toe are densely knit to keep those areas from wearing out; a bit of spandex in the heel and toe adds strength. Elastic throughout helps the socks stretch and retain their shape over time. But a raised seam across the top of the toe could irritate the foot and give a hiker blisters. Better socks have a smooth seam. Other drawbacks: chaff in the wool (the processor didn’t eliminate all field debris after the sheep was sheared), loose threads, and sloppy finishing at the top of the ankle.
 
Bottom line. “Construction could be better, and you’d expect higher wool content for the price,” our expert said.









L.L.Bean women’s braided leather belt, $35


The leather isn’t butter-soft, but it’s fine for a belt. The braids are machine made, and the belt (made in California) features simple, flat-cut leather with unfinished edges that could abrade over time. The braid’s ends were taped before sewing and double backstitched to create sturdier seams. The sewing is neat. The buckle components fit together nicely, and the metal prong that slips into the hole is well finished, so it’s unlikely to snag on other materials.

Bottom line. “It’s well made overall,” our expert said, “and decent for the price.”










New Balance 587 running shoe, $115

It looks well built, with double-stitching at most joints and good adhesion between the sole and upper, but the synthetic materials seem cheap. The shoe feels very stiff, and inflexible materials could result in unusual wear. Because the materials aren’t porous, the shoe is likely to retain heat. It’s also somewhat heavier than many of today’s running shoes, which tend to be very light. The company’s plants are in Maine and Massachusetts.

 Bottom line. “The shoes appear well made but are very stiff and use crude-looking materials,” our expert said. “For the money, there are better choices.”








Orvis cropped cotton pants for women, $54

They’re made (in California) of a stretchy jersey knit, like T-shirt fabric but denser. The two pockets aren’t pocket bags but are instead a single piece of fabric folded over itself—a cheaper design. The pants have an elastic waistband, a bar tack at each pocket to help prevent ripping, a T-shirt-style hem, and serged stitching that’s reinforced at seams to prevent unraveling. Sewing at the crotch and hem is neat, but hanging threads as long as 4 inches could snag.

 Bottom line. “The fabric is nice, but the pants seem pricey for what they are,” our expert said.








Woolrich vintage throw, $129



On one side, this blanket (made in Woolrich, Pa.) is 84 percent wool and 16 percent nylon; on the other, it’s nubby polyester and acrylic sherpa fleece. The fleece side is a stretchy double knit with a fuzzy texture to counterbalance the roughness of the wool on the flip side. It has an old-fashioned look, and the big, loopy chain stitch around the edge adds to the hand-sewn feeling, though it’s made by machine, as is the rest of the blanket. If the edge were to wear out, the chain stitch would unravel, but it’s purely decorative, so the blanket would stay intact. The sides are actually held together with a conventional serged seam that’s concealed from view.

 Bottom line. “It’s a classic,” our expert said. “Good fabric choices and construction details mean it’s something you’ll have for a very long time.”






 




Car wars: Comparing pedigrees

Most vehicles are multinational, even those with iconic American nameplates, and many imports are surprisingly red, white, and blue. Case in point: The Chevrolet Spark (below left) and Toyota Sienna (below right). Only 10 percent of the Chevy’s parts are American or Canadian; more than 75 percent (including the engine) are from Korea, where the vehicle is assembled, and the automatic transmission is made in Japan. By contrast, 75 percent of the Sienna (including its engine) is American. It’s assembled in Indiana.We know those facts because the American Automobile Labeling Act requires passenger vehicles, pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans to bear labels specifying the value of their U.S. and Canadian parts (as a percentage of the total value of all car parts), the country of assembly, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. That information is typically on the vehicle’s window sticker.

					Save up to 50% on Mexico All-Inclusive Vacations!
				

				Nestled between the glittering blue waters of the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean, Mexico draws visitors to its pristine beaches and historic towns with tropical weather and affordable costs. Since 1984, Vacations To Go has helped more than six million travelers plan discount vacations, and we'll help you find your ideal Mexico resort at the lowest possible price!
				

				All-inclusive resorts are popular lodging options where one price covers accommodations, meals, snacks, beverages and many activities. The quote box at left will provide rates for all-inclusive resorts as well as traditional hotels, with or without airfare.
				

				We offer all-inclusive Mexico vacation packages in three main areas -- the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico's Pacific Coast and Central Mexico. Each location offers countless activities and attractions.
				

				In the Yucatan, you'll find the white-sand beaches and nonstop nightlife of Cancun as well as the bustling walk-streets and beautiful nature preserves of Playa del Carmen. Head to the resort community of Puerto Aventuras for golf, tennis and waterfront shops, or visit the laidback island of Cozumel -- a renowned diving destination with 100 dive sites and miles of unspoiled reefs. Thousands journey to Tulum each year to see well-preserved Mayan ruins perched upon seaside cliffs, and the charming capital of the Yucatan, Merida, is an excellent base for visiting nearby Chichen Itza and other Mayan ruins.
				

				On Mexico's Pacific Coast, Puerto Vallarta's stellar position between the Sierra Madre and Bahia de Banderas promises plenty of opportunities for the adventurous. Friendly beach towns like Manzanillo, Huatulco and Ixtapa are ideal for snorkeling and fishing, and the ecologically rich Sea of Cortez and luxury shopping malls of ritzy Los Cabos are worth exploring. In Acapulco, be sure to catch the famous cliff divers of La Quebrada, while historical sites, craft markets and the Pacifico Brewery await in sunny Mazatlan.
				

				In Central Mexico, consider a pleasant colonial town like Guadalajara, with its historical attractions and expansive parks and golf courses. Or visit cosmopolitan Mexico City for great restaurants, shopping and museums.
	           

				Click any link to search for your perfect Mexico resort, or use the quote box above. Call us at 800-998-6925 for a reservation. Our fast, friendly travel counselors will be happy to assist!
