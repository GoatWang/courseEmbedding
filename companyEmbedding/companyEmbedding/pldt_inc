  PLDT Group CSR Statement At the PLDT Group of Companies, Corporate Social Responsibility is grounded in our belief that an integral part of our business is the imperative to help improve the overall well-being of the Filipino people. To achieve this goal, we will address proactively the interests of our various stakeholders.

The creed of our business strategy is the desire to change lives for the better.   
General Practice on Stakeholder Engagement Shareholders
Pursuant to our CG Manual, it is the duty of the Board to promote and uphold stockholders’ rights.   Right to vote   Pre-emptive right   Right to inspect corporate books and records   Right to timely receive relevant information   Right to dividends   Appraisal right 
Stockholders are encouraged to attend annual and special meetings and are apprised ahead of time of their right to appoint a proxy in case they could not personally attend and exercise their voting rights in such meetings. Stockholders are also given an opportunity to ask questions or raise their concerns in such meetings. The Company considers and, when appropriate and technically feasible, allows the use of secure electronic voting at the stockholders’ meetings. Sample Voting Proxy Card 
Shareholders who wish to raise matters or concerns relating to the business of the Company may elevate such matters to the corporate secretary, the investor relations officer, concerned units of PLDT’s management or the Board of Directors.  
It is the Board’s function to explore and implement steps to reduce excessive or unnecessary costs that impede stockholders’ participation and to act with transparency and fairness at the annual and special stockholders’ meetings. The Board shall likewise ensure that the Company remains faithful to its undertaking to make timely disclosures of material information and transactions that could potentially affect the market price of the Company’s shares and such other information which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the Securities Regulation Code (SRC) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations including, without limitation, earnings results, acquisition or disposal of significant assets, off balance-sheet transactions, related party transactions, Board membership changes, shareholdings of Directors and Officers and any changes thereto, and remuneration of Directors and Officers. 
The Company files with the Philippine SEC and the PSE all written disclosures or reports on material information and transactions in accordance with the SRC and its Implementing Rules and Regulations and the established procedures of the Philippine SEC and the PSE regarding such matters. 
PLDT’s Code of Ethics prohibits directors, officers and employees from dealing in the Company’s shares when in possession of material non-public information about and involving the Company. Directors, officers and employees are enjoined to report to the Company their dealings in the Company’s shares, regardless of whether such dealings were effected during or outside the blackout period, within three trading days from the date of the transaction, to enable the filing of the required disclosures to the Philippine SEC and the PSE. During blackout periods, dealing in Company shares by directors, officers or employees is not allowed and in any exceptional case, prior notice to the Company should be made of any such dealing in Company shares, in accordance with the Company’s policy on Blackout Period/Restriction on Trading of Shares. 
In addition, the Company’s Guidelines on the Proper Handling of Related Party Transactions provides the procedures for the review, approval and disclosure of related party transactions in order to ensure that they are fair, on arm’s length terms, and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, as a whole. Material related party transactions are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which is composed of the Chairman and two (2) members, all of whom are independent directors, and subject to approval by the Board. 
PLDT takes pride in its multi-awarded investor relations office. PLDT has also been recognized several times as the company most committed to a strong dividend policy. It is encouraging proof that sound corporate governance, concern for investors/shareholders, and profitability go hand in hand.     Minority Shareholders 
Minority stockholders have the right to nominate candidates for directors, including independent directors, and the right to cumulative voting which enables minority shareholder representation on the Board. 
Rights of minority stockholders are protected through the Company’s compliance with applicable rules and observance of best practices which increase the quality of Board oversight and lessen the risks arising from conflicts of interest, including the following: (a) election of independent directors in the Board; (b) Audit Committee composed entirely of independent directors; (c) majority voting membership of independent directors in the Governance and Nomination Committee and Executive Compensation Committee; and (d) Company policies on the handling of conflicts of interest and related party transactions which provide for the proper review, approval and disclosures of such relationships and transactions. Customers
It is PLDT’s privilege to serve a broad range of customers from residential customers, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), corporate customers covering large local and international companies, organizations and government. PLDT continually strives to satisfy its customers’ expectations and concerns regarding quality of service, pricing, application process, service provisioning process, repair and restoration service and the billing process. We continuously engage with our customers through various touchpoints with the end in view of knowing and understanding our customers’ communication products and service needs, promptly addressing their concerns and identifying areas where we could further enhance customer experience.  Employees
PLDT recognizes the myriad concerns of its employees. PLDT respects the rights of its personnel, chief among these are the right to self-organization, safe working conditions, rest and leisure, and work-life balance. It also provides opportunities for skills, leadership and competency training as well as career development. PLDT provides adequate opportunity for career advancement on a merit-based system. Compensation and incentives are likewise determined on the basis of performance and accomplishment. Dedicated staff and facilities are made available for the training and development programs of the Company. The Company organizes programs that support the well-being of employees, allows them to participate in PLDT’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities and obtains their feedback on company concerns. Organization and Employee Opinion Survey is conducted at regular intervals to gauge employee engagement as well as feel the pulse of PLDT employees across the organization at different levels and positions concerning topics and issue which are prioritized and addressed in the various people programs of the company.  In accordance with the Company’s Personnel Manual, the Company provides medical and dental benefits for our employees, which include hospitalization, doctor consultation, medicines and laboratory tests. The Company monitors and submits reports on employee health and safety in accordance with applicable regulations.   Health, Safety and Welfare Training and Development Suppliers
PLDT aspires to maintain mutually beneficial relationships only with like-principled suppliers that uphold PLDT’s core values of fairness, accountability, integrity, and transparency in their own businesses. PLDT has over 1,000 active suppliers which serve the requirements of the PLDT Group, ranging from capital expenditures to operating expenditure items, as well as services. The Company’s Supplier/Contractor Relations Policy provides for the general principles to be followed in vendor selection. Suppliers are required to undergo an accreditation process before they engage in business with PLDT. Among the criteria for accreditation are financial capability, technical capability, compliance with applicable laws, including those pertaining to industrial relations, environment, health and safety and intellectual property rights. The Company’s purchases, as a general rule, are made on the basis of competitive bidding of accredited and qualified suppliers, in accordance with the aforementioned policy. Environment
PLDT is committed to do its part in addressing the pressing need to preserve and protect our environment. As such, PLDT ensures compliance with rules and regulations from local government regulatory offices such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ (DENR) Environmental Management Bureau, the Laguna Lake Development Authority and other similar agencies and offices. Furthermore, projects to reduce waste and the Company’s carbon footprint are also being implemented. The Company regularly monitors relevant Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) indicators such as direct energy consumption, energy saved, initiatives to reduce energy consumption, total water withdrawn by source, direct and indirect greenhouse gasses emission by weight, total weight of waste by type and disposal method, and total environmental expenditures and investment. Creditors
In accordance with our Code of Ethics, we protect the rights of our creditors by publicly disclosing all material information, such as earnings results and risk exposures relating to loan covenants. Our disclosure controls and procedures also include periodic reports to our creditors such as our latest certified Financial Statements, No Default Certification, and Certification on compliance with financial ratio limits. Communities
The Company operates in communities all over the Philippines and we care about how our operations affect them and how our products and services can improve the lives of their residents. As a telecommunication service provider, PLDT serves communities and the people that live in them by providing products and services that offer various options for people to connect with each other. As a corporation, PLDT creates wider opportunities for employment, entrepreneurship and greater well-being. As a corporate citizen, PLDT actively engages with the communities, including the sectors directly affected by its operations, through CSR projects in education, health, community, environment, livelihood development, youth development and sports, and disaster relief operations.

History[edit]




4th PLDT logo (1996–2016)


PLDT was established on November 28, 1928, by a Philippine Government act. Philippine legislature and approved by then Governor-General Henry L. Stimson by means of a merger of four telephone companies under operation of the American telephone company GTE.[5] Known as Act 3436, the bill granted PLDT a 50-year charter and the right to establish a Philippine telephone network linking major points nationwide. However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years.
By the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world.
Telephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953.
On December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas.
PLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, “In the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.”[6][7]
After President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re-privatized as Ramon's son, Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became PLDT chief.[8] By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. Later that year, Hong Kong-based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% stake in PLDT making it the majority owner of the conglomerate. The company's CEO Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new conglomerate's President replacing Cojuangco, who assumed post as Chairman until 2004, when Pangilinan became his successor.[8]
On April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the "long distance telephone" from its corporate name and has since been known as PLDT Inc.[9] Its board of directors approved of the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.[2]
PLDT-Digitel merger[edit]
PLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings on March 2011 with the cost of ₱69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011.
Other investments[edit]
Twenty percent of MERALCO shall be sold to PLDT, according to the Lopez family who owns the Philippine's largest electric distributor on March 13, 2009. The deal is set to be done in the third quarter of 2009 with the cost of 20 billion pesos. The said action was done to prevent the hostile takeover of San Miguel Corporation, which already owns a large portion of MERALCO.[10]
Wireless[edit]
See also: Smart Communications, TNT (cellular service), and Sun Cellular
PLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its subsidiaries, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular.
Media ventures[edit]
In 1998, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund, acquired Nation Broadcasting Corporation from the joint consortium of the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar. In 2007, MediaQuest bought the shares of GV Broadcasting Systems, a licensed direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television provider from Satventures Inc. of the Galang family. With this, GV changed its corporate name to MediaScape Inc.
On March 2, 2010, PLDT announced that its subsidiary, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has acquired 100 percent of TV5 Network (TV5) and Primedia Inc from Media Prima and former PLDT Chairman Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr.
Ownership[edit]
The Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%),[11] Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non-Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%).
Bandwidth caps[edit]
In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called "volume boosters" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). "In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle."[12] Globe followed the suit with a similar "volume boost" arrangement.[13]
Lock-in period[edit]
In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions.[14] As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period.[15] The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: "8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions."[14] Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states "Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier",[16] the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.

History[edit]




4th PLDT logo (1996–2016)


PLDT was established on November 28, 1928, by a Philippine Government act. Philippine legislature and approved by then Governor-General Henry L. Stimson by means of a merger of four telephone companies under operation of the American telephone company GTE.[5] Known as Act 3436, the bill granted PLDT a 50-year charter and the right to establish a Philippine telephone network linking major points nationwide. However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years.
By the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world.
Telephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953.
On December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas.
PLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, “In the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.”[6][7]
After President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re-privatized as Ramon's son, Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became PLDT chief.[8] By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. Later that year, Hong Kong-based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% stake in PLDT making it the majority owner of the conglomerate. The company's CEO Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new conglomerate's President replacing Cojuangco, who assumed post as Chairman until 2004, when Pangilinan became his successor.[8]
On April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the "long distance telephone" from its corporate name and has since been known as PLDT Inc.[9] Its board of directors approved of the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.[2]
PLDT-Digitel merger[edit]
PLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings on March 2011 with the cost of ₱69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011.
Other investments[edit]
Twenty percent of MERALCO shall be sold to PLDT, according to the Lopez family who owns the Philippine's largest electric distributor on March 13, 2009. The deal is set to be done in the third quarter of 2009 with the cost of 20 billion pesos. The said action was done to prevent the hostile takeover of San Miguel Corporation, which already owns a large portion of MERALCO.[10]
Wireless[edit]
See also: Smart Communications, TNT (cellular service), and Sun Cellular
PLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its subsidiaries, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular.
Media ventures[edit]
In 1998, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund, acquired Nation Broadcasting Corporation from the joint consortium of the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar. In 2007, MediaQuest bought the shares of GV Broadcasting Systems, a licensed direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television provider from Satventures Inc. of the Galang family. With this, GV changed its corporate name to MediaScape Inc.
On March 2, 2010, PLDT announced that its subsidiary, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has acquired 100 percent of TV5 Network (TV5) and Primedia Inc from Media Prima and former PLDT Chairman Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr.
Ownership[edit]
The Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%),[11] Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non-Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%).
Bandwidth caps[edit]
In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called "volume boosters" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). "In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle."[12] Globe followed the suit with a similar "volume boost" arrangement.[13]
Lock-in period[edit]
In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions.[14] As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period.[15] The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: "8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions."[14] Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states "Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier",[16] the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.

PLDT was established on November 28, 1928, by a Philippine Government act. Philippine legislature and approved by then Governor-General Henry L. Stimson by means of a merger of four telephone companies under operation of the American telephone company GTE.[5] Known as Act 3436, the bill granted PLDT a 50-year charter and the right to establish a Philippine telephone network linking major points nationwide. However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years.
By the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world.
Telephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953.
On December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas.
PLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, “In the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.”[6][7]
After President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re-privatized as Ramon's son, Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became PLDT chief.[8] By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. Later that year, Hong Kong-based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% stake in PLDT making it the majority owner of the conglomerate. The company's CEO Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new conglomerate's President replacing Cojuangco, who assumed post as Chairman until 2004, when Pangilinan became his successor.[8]
On April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the "long distance telephone" from its corporate name and has since been known as PLDT Inc.[9] Its board of directors approved of the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.[2]
PLDT-Digitel merger[edit]
PLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings on March 2011 with the cost of ₱69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011.
Other investments[edit]
Twenty percent of MERALCO shall be sold to PLDT, according to the Lopez family who owns the Philippine's largest electric distributor on March 13, 2009. The deal is set to be done in the third quarter of 2009 with the cost of 20 billion pesos. The said action was done to prevent the hostile takeover of San Miguel Corporation, which already owns a large portion of MERALCO.[10]
Wireless[edit]
See also: Smart Communications, TNT (cellular service), and Sun Cellular
PLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its subsidiaries, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular.
Media ventures[edit]
In 1998, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund, acquired Nation Broadcasting Corporation from the joint consortium of the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar. In 2007, MediaQuest bought the shares of GV Broadcasting Systems, a licensed direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television provider from Satventures Inc. of the Galang family. With this, GV changed its corporate name to MediaScape Inc.
On March 2, 2010, PLDT announced that its subsidiary, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has acquired 100 percent of TV5 Network (TV5) and Primedia Inc from Media Prima and former PLDT Chairman Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr.
Ownership[edit]
The Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%),[11] Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non-Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%).
Bandwidth caps[edit]
In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called "volume boosters" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). "In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle."[12] Globe followed the suit with a similar "volume boost" arrangement.[13]
Lock-in period[edit]
In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions.[14] As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period.[15] The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: "8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions."[14] Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states "Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier",[16] the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.

However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years.
By the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world.
Telephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953.
On December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas.
PLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, “In the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.”[6][7]
After President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re-privatized as Ramon's son, Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became PLDT chief.[8] By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. Later that year, Hong Kong-based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% stake in PLDT making it the majority owner of the conglomerate. The company's CEO Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new conglomerate's President replacing Cojuangco, who assumed post as Chairman until 2004, when Pangilinan became his successor.[8]
On April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the "long distance telephone" from its corporate name and has since been known as PLDT Inc.[9] Its board of directors approved of the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.[2]
PLDT-Digitel merger[edit]
PLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings on March 2011 with the cost of ₱69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011.
Other investments[edit]
Twenty percent of MERALCO shall be sold to PLDT, according to the Lopez family who owns the Philippine's largest electric distributor on March 13, 2009. The deal is set to be done in the third quarter of 2009 with the cost of 20 billion pesos. The said action was done to prevent the hostile takeover of San Miguel Corporation, which already owns a large portion of MERALCO.[10]
Wireless[edit]
See also: Smart Communications, TNT (cellular service), and Sun Cellular
PLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its subsidiaries, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular.
Media ventures[edit]
In 1998, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund, acquired Nation Broadcasting Corporation from the joint consortium of the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar. In 2007, MediaQuest bought the shares of GV Broadcasting Systems, a licensed direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television provider from Satventures Inc. of the Galang family. With this, GV changed its corporate name to MediaScape Inc.
On March 2, 2010, PLDT announced that its subsidiary, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has acquired 100 percent of TV5 Network (TV5) and Primedia Inc from Media Prima and former PLDT Chairman Antonio "Tonyboy" O. Cojuangco, Jr.
Ownership[edit]
The Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%),[11] Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non-Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%).
Bandwidth caps[edit]
In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called "volume boosters" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). "In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle."[12] Globe followed the suit with a similar "volume boost" arrangement.[13]
Lock-in period[edit]
In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions.[14] As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period.[15] The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: "8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions."[14] Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states "Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier",[16] the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.
