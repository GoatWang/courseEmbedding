The Wi-Fi-connected ecobee3 thermostat and remote sensors measure temperature and occupancy in multiple locations, resulting in increased comfort when an occupant is home and energy savings when he or she is away. In addition, customers can monitor and control their ecobee3 thermostat anytime, anywhere, using their smartphones, tablets, or computers. In addition, working with its remote sensors, the ecobee3 recognizes which rooms are occupied and automatically adjusts the temperature based on the readings in those rooms. If a user’s schedule changes and he or she leaves the home, the sensors will recognize this and prevent the heating and cooling system(s) from running unnecessarily when a home is empty. The more sensors included, the smarter the ecobee3 becomes at delivering comfort where it matters and savings where it counts. The ecobee3 doesn’t use power stealing, which can result in sudden and unexpected failure, particularly during extreme hot or cold weather. The ecobee3 rather has a consistent power source that is hardwired in — meaning a user can trust the ecobee3 will continue to deliver comfort, regardless of the weather.

The ecobee3 is ecobee's flagship product which was originally launched September 26, 2014.[3] It is a touchscreen thermostat that works with up to 32 remote temperature/motion sensors to adjust the thermostat based on where you are.[4][5] It also has IFTTT integration.[6][7] An updated version of the ecobee3 was released in 2015 that works with Apple HomeKit.[8][9] The ecobee3 lite was released on October 17, 2016.[10] The ecobee3 lite is a less expensive thermostat that resembles the ecobee3, but does not include any remote temperature sensors.[11] Support for remote temperature sensors was added to the ecobee3 lite in March 2017.[12]
On May 3, 2017, the company announced the unveiling of its 4th-generation product (ecobee4), which includes built-in Amazon Alexa Voice Service.[13]
The ecobee4, ecobee3 (and lite) allows the user to set different schedules each day for various modes, including home, away, and sleep. The remote sensors detect temperature and occupancy and can engage a Smart Away mode if no movement is detected.[14] The ecobee3/4 integrates the remote sensors by controlling to the average room temperature for all sensors that are included in the mode setting (and detect occupancy, if enabled). A vacation mode can be programmed for extended times away from home.[15]
With this smart thermostat, you can set convenient reminders for HVAC maintenance, Furnace filter replacement, UV Lamp replacement, as well as alerts for Low Temperature, High Temperature, Low Humidity, and High Humidity.[16]

Products[edit]
The ecobee3 is ecobee's flagship product which was originally launched September 26, 2014.[3] It is a touchscreen thermostat that works with up to 32 remote temperature/motion sensors to adjust the thermostat based on where you are.[4][5] It also has IFTTT integration.[6][7] An updated version of the ecobee3 was released in 2015 that works with Apple HomeKit.[8][9] The ecobee3 lite was released on October 17, 2016.[10] The ecobee3 lite is a less expensive thermostat that resembles the ecobee3, but does not include any remote temperature sensors.[11] Support for remote temperature sensors was added to the ecobee3 lite in March 2017.[12]
On May 3, 2017, the company announced the unveiling of its 4th-generation product (ecobee4), which includes built-in Amazon Alexa Voice Service.[13]
The ecobee4, ecobee3 (and lite) allows the user to set different schedules each day for various modes, including home, away, and sleep. The remote sensors detect temperature and occupancy and can engage a Smart Away mode if no movement is detected.[14] The ecobee3/4 integrates the remote sensors by controlling to the average room temperature for all sensors that are included in the mode setting (and detect occupancy, if enabled). A vacation mode can be programmed for extended times away from home.[15]
With this smart thermostat, you can set convenient reminders for HVAC maintenance, Furnace filter replacement, UV Lamp replacement, as well as alerts for Low Temperature, High Temperature, Low Humidity, and High Humidity.[16]

Sensor Technology
Deliver comfort to the rooms that matter most.
Most thermostats read the temperature in one place (usually the
              hallway) which can make other rooms uncomfortable. ecobee3 uses
              room sensors to deliver the preferred temperature to the rooms
              that matter. Simple.













































Smarter Comfort
A complete comfort system for your home.




Follow Me uses room sensors to know which room you’re in and automatically adjust to your preferred temperature.




Smart Home/Away ensures you’re comfortable while you’re at home and saving money when you’re not.












Smarter Control

Adjust temperature and comfort settings easily
                from your Android and iOS devices, including Apple Watch.



Free energy reports give you insights on how
                much you’ve saved based on run times and offer tips for further
                savings.

                isn’t working.


























Built to last
ecobee is hardwired so you'll never be left out in the cold.
Being hardwired means your thermostat isn’t relying on a battery
              or your HVAC equipment to charge itself (aka “power-stealing”).
              A little bit extra, for no extra.












Easy Setup
Getting started is simple.

Wireless Room Sensors





Ordinary thermostats read the temperature in only one room, but are supposed to deliver comfort in all rooms. ecobee3 remote sensors deliver the right temperature in the rooms that matter most.


 




Smart Home/Away





If your ecobee3 senses that you are home during your scheduled Away period, or away during your scheduled Home period, it will automatically override your schedule to maximize comfort and savings.


 




Follow Me





Control your comfort by averaging the temperature of the selected sensors that detect motion or all of the selected sensors in your home, regardless of motion.


 
See all features
 




Smart Recovery





ecobee3 understands how your home heats up and cools down, and uses wi-fi to track your local weather throughout the day. It then uses this information to determine the best way to bring your home to your desired indoor temperature when you arrive home and maintain it while minimizing how long your heating or cooling equipment runs for.


 




Free Cooling





In homes with ventilators, ecobee3 will recognize the temperature difference on cool summer evenings and will use the outside air to cool down your home instead of the air conditioner.


 




Optimal Humidity





For homes with humidifiers, ecobee3 regulates indoor humidity to prevent frost buildup on windows when it’s cold outside and high humidity indoors.


 




AC Overcool to Dehumidify





ecobee3 can use your air conditioner to lower indoor humidity in the absence of a dehumidifier.


 




Alerts & Reminders





ecobee3 is constantly monitoring your equipment performance and will send you an alert if anything is not working or working sub-optimally. Similarly, ecobee3 can send you service reminders to help you maintain your equipment.


 




Fan Dissipation





At the end of a heating or cooling cycle, when the coil or heat exchanger is still hot/cold, ecobee3 runs the fan to get the most heating/cooling and dehumidification out from your equipment.


 




Robust Staging Options





ecobee3 optimizes usage of multistage heating and cooling equipment by engaging the higher stage when indoor temperature is notably different than desired temperature and switching back to the lower stage as your home gets closer to the desired temperature. You can also control staging by using advanced setting options.


 




Standards Compliant





ecobee smart thermostats are compatible with HRVs, ERVs, and Remote Sensors, giving you ultimate control over your environment. ecobee has a robust API and an active developer community working on new ways to integrate your thermostat into your connected home.


 




Home IQ





Home IQ™ shows you how much energy you conserved each month and gives you valuable insight into your heating and cooling equipment. It’s like a home energy audit at no additional cost!

Best Household Improvement Ever!
I'm a new homeowner and not yet secure in my DIY skills so I asked my brother-in-law to help me install it, but in truth I could have done it myself! I specifically purchased Ecobee to work with our Amazon Echo and so my husband who has MD can control the temperature and it is perfect! 
akoWonderWoman on August 31, 2016

Great Customer Service
I love my Ecobee3! We are renters, so this was a big undertaking for us to replace the thermostat that came with our apartment with a digital thermostat. But our air conditioning bills were getting crazy, our thermostat was very unreliable (it would randomly go up to 85 degrees in the middle of the night or other times for no reason), and we wanted to be able to control it from outside the home. We briefly considered The Nest, which has some great rebates from our power company. But after poring over reviews, we decided to go with the Ecobee, mainly because it was Home Kit compatible, and we may want to use that in the future since we have an Apple home network and Apple TV.

Great for too-hot-in-summer and too-cold-in-winter rooms
Product is great (and arrived fast). We needed our baby's room to have a sensor as it is always hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, as it was a guessing game with the original thermostat downstairs. After having 2 professional HVAC people come over and telling us there's nothing we can do with the ducts to improve the situation, we compromised for a smart thermostat to at least eliminate the guessing game (I would still want to change our HVAC configuration, but that's a 10k job).
Bootvi on August 29, 2016

I'm in love with my ecobee
I'm in love with my ecobee. Upgraded from an old non-programmable Honeywell thermostat. So far, my HVAC seems to run MUCH less than with the old thermostat. I love the programmable schedules, and the sensor modules. I also installed the unit myself using the Power Extender Kit, and it was super easy. Really looking forward to lower energy consumption (and costs!) with this thermostat. 
BigIrishApe on August 25, 2016


5 stars







Great purchase
Better than Nest in that it has discrete external sensors to focus on rooms you care about the most. Easy to program schedule. Set up was overall pretty easy. Love that I can control the temperature on my cellphone. Similar to Nest, it is a good-looking modern product but with (in my opnion) a more pleasant display and touchscreen.
Jacquelyn M. Means on August 24, 2016

The functionality and ease of use of this device is amazing. I'm already seeing the energy savings
The functionality and ease of use of this device is amazing. I'm already seeing the energy savings. The sensor system is simply brilliant and the fact that they have motion detectors is amazing. The app is very easy to use and a breeze to setup with apple home. I will be purchasing additional sensors to make it even more smarter around my house. There is a lot of technology here, which is the main reason I choose this over the Nest and also a 3 year warranty.
Y. Acosta on August 24, 2016


5 stars







Best Thermostat On The Market!
I really believe this is the best thermostat on the market. You can place multiple external sensors around the house so that the Ecobee3 (E3) knows that the temperature is in different parts of the house. Since the E3 knows both the temperature in other parts of the house AND if someone is present, it can dynamically "care" about the temperature only in rooms that have recently seen occupancy!

“The ecobee3 is tops because it allows for temperature measurements through its room
                        sensors.”
“The thermostat is easy to install and even easier to program, and it’s loaded with
                        features including a room sensor for heating and cooling rooms outside of the thermostat
                        zone… It’s our new Editors Choice for smart thermostats.”
“If you haven’t used any of this technology yet, it might be time to start thinking
                        about it.”
“A sleek-looking unit with elegant touchscreen controls and a room sensor accessory
                        that will monitor conditions away from the thermostat itself.”

At EcoBee, we do not claim to be perfect however we are taking a positive step toward a more sustainable way of life. It’s undeniable that global warming is already affecting the world we know. The good news is that the know-how to fix this problem and prevent a global environmental disaster exists. As individuals there are many simple steps we can take to cut global warming pollution by making conserving energy a part of our daily routine. For example, each time we choose a compact fluorescent light bulb over an incandescent bulb, we’ll lower our energy bill and keep nearly 700 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the air over the bulb’s lifetime. With our EcoBee products, we’re adopting this simple course of conservation.
