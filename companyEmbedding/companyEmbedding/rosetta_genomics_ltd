How do I make a payment?

How do I make a payment?
If you receive a Rosetta Genomics statement, there are several options for payment:

Check or money order: 
Please make it payable to Rosetta Genomics and mail it to the address below:


Credit or debit card: 
You may complete the form on your invoice or to pay by phone, please call us at the number below. A receipt can be mailed to you upon request.

Please mail your payment to the address on your statement. We also accept PayPal payments. Please contact Rosetta Genomics Customer Service to make payment.



Did you bill my primary health plan for these charges?

Rosetta Genomics accepts third-party assignment for all health plans and will bill your health plan directly. We require full and accurate health plan information from you and your provider. If the health plan information we receive is incorrect or missing information, we may not be able to file a claim with your health plan. 



My bill shows a claim was filed with my health plan. Why am I receiving a bill for the full amount?

You may receive a bill for the full amount if:

1. Your health plan information is incorrect or outdated in our system
2. Your health plan didn't reply to our claim in a timely manner
3. Your health plan denied payment for some or all of our services

Contact your health plan at the customer service phone number on the back of your member card. If they received our claim, ask them why payment has been delayed. If they did not receive the claim, make sure we have your updated health plan information


Why do I have a balance left over after my insurance has paid?

1. You have non-government insurance and are responsible for a co-payment, co-insurance, deductible, and/or non-covered services.
2. You have Medicare and are responsible for 20% of the amount Medicare has set as the cost of the test.
3. You have Medicare and have signed an ABN (advanced beneficiary notice). In this case, you may owe the difference between what Medicare paid and what they have set as the cost of the test.

Most health plans today have deductibles, co-insurance, or required co-payment amounts you must pay. If you believe this portion of your bill is your health plan's responsibility, contact them using the customer service phone number on the back of your insurance card.


Do you offer payment plans?

In some cases, yes. Contact Rosetta Genomics Customer service to determine your eligibility.


My name, address, or other personal information changed. Who should I notify?

Please contact Customer Service and we will be happy to update your information and submit a corrected claim when appropriate.


Why have I received an invoice from Rosetta Genomics?

You may not be aware your physician has sent your specimen to Rosetta Genomics for testing. Some of the high complexity tests we provide are only available through Rosetta Genomics. The statement you receive is for medically necessary testing ordered by your physician and provided by a Rosetta Genomics laboratory. The statement is for laboratory testing fees only, and is separate from any bill you may have received from your physician and/or paid at your physician's office.

Please refer to the message on your Rosetta Genomics statement or the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from your health plan for more specific information about why you received a statement.

You may receive a bill for some or all of the billed amount because:
1. Your health plan information was not received or the wrong health plan information was received with your test request.
2. Your health plan processed the claim and denied payment (see your EOB for explanation).
3. Your health plan processed the claim and applied the balance to your health plan co-pay, co-insurance, or deductible requirement.
4. The insurance carrier did not respond to the claim.


Am I required to pay past due balances to obtain future services?

Your payments are due upon receipt. A payment for all past due balances is required at the time of service. Rosetta Genomics reserves the right to refuse laboratory services for failure to pay for past services.


Can Rosetta Genomics tell me how much I can expect to pay for my tests?

The price you pay for Rosetta Genomics testing depends on several variables:
1. If you have valid health plan coverage for the services ordered by your physician.
2. Rosetta Genomics is or is not a participating provider in your health plan network.
3. Your health plan or Medicare does not pay for some or all of the tests ordered by your physician because they do not consider the tests medically necessary.
4. Your healthcare provider or physician has an agreement with Rosetta Genomics.


How can I have Medicare send my invoice to my secondary health plan/carrier?

Medicare automatically forwards or “crosses over” your claim to your secondary health plan or insurance carrier when Medicare or your Medicare Advantage Health Plan are aware you have secondary coverage (sometimes referred to as Medi-Gap coverage). You must inform Medicare directly of your secondary insurance coverage.


How do I submit secondary health plan or insurance carrier information?

Rosetta Genomics will file eligible claims to a secondary health plan or insurance carrier when it is provided by the patient or responsible party. To submit your secondary insurance information, please call Rosetta Genomics Customer Service.


Does Rosetta Genomics have a program for patients experiencing financial hardship and/or patients who do not have insurance?

Rosetta Genomics offers payment plans in monthly installments until your balance is paid in full. We also offer The Rosetta Genomics Financial Assistance Plan which provides free or reduced-fee laboratory services, to those who qualify based on U.S. Department of Health and Human Service poverty guidelines.


Are Rosetta Genomics services eligible for Flexible Spending Accounts (“FSA”) or Health Reimbursement Account (“HRA”)?

Yes. You will need to contact your FSA or HRA administrator for instructions on filing requirements.


How can I find out if Rosetta Genomics is a participating provider with my health plan?

Rosetta Genomics is a participating provider with a growing list of health plans covering more than 235 million lives in the United States. However, it is the patients’ responsibility to verify benefits before services are performed. Any questions regarding coverage should be directed to your health plan.


I don’t understand why my testing wasn’t paid by my health plan?

Please refer to the messages and reason/denial codes on your health plan EOB and your Rosetta Genomics statement for more specific information about why you received a statement. If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact your health plan first.


Why was my health plan billed with incorrect insurance information?

Your health plan is billed using the information provided to us on the original test order from your physician, also called a test requisition. Sometimes the information provided on the requisition is incorrect. To ensure your health plan is billed properly, please present your insurance card at each physician's office. Please also make sure your physician's office has your most current health plan and billing information, including your current address, contact information, and correct date of birth.


Why do I have to give my insurance information each time I visit my physician?

Americans change their health plan coverage frequently, on average every three years. Open enrollment occurs annually. It is important to provide your most current health plan information at each visit to ensure you receive your eligible benefits.


I received information from my health plan about my benefits and I do not understand all of the information. Can you help me?

Please contact your health plan directly. Information about how a specific claim is processed should be provided to you from your health plan with their Explanation of Benefits (EOB). You can also review the Glossary of Health Plan terms provided on this website which may help you interpret the information provided by your health plan.


Can Rosetta Genomics tell me if my testing is covered by my health plan?

No, Rosetta Genomics does not know each individual patient’s health plan coverage. It is the patient's responsibility to verify benefits before services are performed. Any questions regarding coverage should be directed to your health plan.


Why does my Rosetta Genomics statement include charges for additional tests that were not on my physician's original order?

Your physician may have requested additional testing after the order was submitted or your physician ordered a test that includes a "reflex" test.  Reflex testing is performed when the results of your original test require more detailed information about the findings of the initial test.


Where does Rosetta Genomics obtain the diagnosis information related to my claim?

Rosetta Genomics obtains diagnosis information from your ordering physician’s office. If your health plan denied your claim due to the diagnosis code, please contact your physician's office and ask them to call Rosetta Genomics Customer Service to update the diagnosis code.


I received a statement from Rosetta Genomics requesting additional information. What should I do?

Please send the requested information to the address or fax number listed on your statement. You can also call the Customer Service phone number listed on your statement.  

If the message on your statement indicates that your health plan needs more information from you in order to process your claim, please contact your health plan directly.


What happens if I cannot afford to pay my bill?

Rosetta Genomics has a Financial Assistance Plan for uninsured and under insured patients or those who may not be able to afford their associated out-of-pocket costs. (Limits and conditions apply.) Contact Customer Service for more information on these programs.





Financial Assistance Plan Rosetta Genomics offers testing at reduced or no cost to uninsured or underinsured patients in the U.S. who meet specific financial criteria.

Bladder cancer can present in various grades and stages. FGFR3 has been shown to identify low-grade, lower risk bladder cancer from urine or tissue-based specimens, while UroVysion is an FDA approved test that has been proven to be very accurate in identifying high-grade, higher risk disease.1 



FGFR3 URINE
FGFR3 TISSUE
UroVysion

FGFR3 URINE




The bladder portfolio of tests includes a proprietary biomarker called FGFR3 mutation analysis, which can be tested together with cytology and UroVysion from a single urine specimen. Bladder cancer can present in various grades and stages, and studies have shown FGFR3 to be associated with low-grade, lower risk tumors and predict better overall survival.2,3 



689 of 690 cysto/biopsy negative patients were FGFR3 negative (specificity 99.9%), and 20 of 21 FGFR3 positive patients were cysto/biopsy positive (PPV 95.2%)4



Associated with low-grade, early stage bladder cancer and predicts better overall survival3



FGFR3 has been shown to detect tumors in the upper urothelial tract from voided urine specimens5



Rapid turnaround time of 3-4 days






Can be combined with UroVysion toassist in covering the completespectrum of bladder cancer

FGFR3 TISSUE




Molecular grading through the use of proprietary biomarker FGFR3 can help determine the prognostic profile of bladder cancer patients through the FGFR3 Tissue test. This test analyzes the mutation and Ki-67 levels in the tissue, which together helps to determine whether a patient’s prognosis is favorable, intermediate, or poor.6 



Assists with initial diagnosis and prognosis



Improves risk stratification of your non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients



Patients with FGFR3 mutations and low Ki-67 levels appear to have better overall survival6

UroVysion




UroVysion is the first and only FDA-approved molecular urine test that detects chromosomal changes associated with bladder cancer. This test has been shown to be highly sensitive for high-grade, higher risk disease.5 It also aids in the initial diagnosis of bladder cancer, and detects bladder cancer recurrence up to 6 months sooner than current diagnostic methods.5 



Can be combined with FGFR3 Urine to assist in covering the complete spectrum (low grade to high grade) of bladder cancer



Available via our TC/PC virtual platform



Overall specificity of 93%, and a combined specificity with cystoscopy of 97%1



Rapid turnaround time of 3-4 days



In addition, a positive UroVysion result has been shown to predict recurrence during BCG therapy7






Additional Information for Pathologists
Working in conjunction with Pathology laboratories around the country, RosettaGX provides the technical component (TC) of UroVysion, while the Pathologist provides the professional component (PC). It is not necessary for Pathology laboratories to acquire specialized equipment or modify facilities. 


Additional Information for Urologists
UroVysion is intended for initial diagnosis of patients with hematuria, or for monitoring recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Consider these hypothetical circumstances that a Urologist may consider UroVysion:

A Urologist who commonly uses cystoscopy with cytology and sees a high rate of recurrence in bladder cancer patients may choose to order UroVysion as an aid in detecting bladder cancer early.
A Urologist who commonly uses cystoscopy without cytology and seeks to detect carcinoma in situ (CIS) early may order UroVysion as an additional diagnostic aid.
A Urologist who uses cystoscopy with other tumor markers, and who has found that these markers can be affected by BCG or inflammation, may add UroVysion to the standard diagnostic procedures.

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]
History[edit]
Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[20] to pursue commercial applications of microRNA research.[21] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ.[22] Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied by medical institutions.[4]

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]
History[edit]
Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[20] to pursue commercial applications of microRNA research.[21] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ.[22] Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied by medical institutions.[4]

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]
History[edit]
Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[20] to pursue commercial applications of microRNA research.[21] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ.[22] Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied by medical institutions.[4]

FAQs REGARDING ROSETTA’S REVERSE STOCK SPLIT ON March 16, 2017

1.	What is the status of the reverse stock split?

On March 13, 2017, our board of directors recommended a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of our ordinary shares.  On March 16, 2017, Rosetta’s shareholders authorized the reverse stock split.  The reverse stock split became effective at the time of its approval by Rosetta’s shareholders. 

2.	What is the reason for the reverse stock split?

The reverse stock split is intended to increase the per share trading price of Rosetta’s ordinary shares to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.

For additional information on the rationale for a reverse stock split, please see our proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to our Report on Form 6-K on February 3, 2017 (available at www.sec.gov).  

There can be no assurance that we will realize the intended purpose of the reverse stock split described above.

3.	What will be the impact of a reverse stock split?

The principal effect of the reverse stock split will be to decrease proportionately the number of authorized and outstanding ordinary shares based on the 1-for-12 reverse stock split ratio.  We will exchange one post-split ordinary share for every twelve ordinary shares.

4.	What will happen to the number of ordinary shares that I own and the related stock price after the reverse stock split?

At the time a reverse stock split is effected, it reduces the number of shares outstanding and increases the share price proportionately.  At the effective time of our 1-for-12 reverse stock split, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was divided by twelve, and the stock price was proportionately adjusted by multiplying the pre-split closing price by 12.  The effect of our reverse stock split will be reflected in the trading price of our ordinary shares and the number of ordinary shares outstanding when the post-split shares begin to trade on March 17, 2017.  After the post-split shares begin trading on March 17, 2017, we cannot make any guarantees regarding the post-split performance or price of our shares.

For illustration purposes only, if prior to the reverse stock split on March 16, 2017, you held 1,200 Rosetta ordinary shares and the closing sale price of our shares that day is $0.15 per share, after the reverse stock split became effective on March 16, 2017 and at the time the market opens on March 17, 2017, you will hold 100 post-split Rosetta ordinary shares, each of which will have a split-adjusted price of $1.80 per share. 

5.	What is the effective date of the reverse stock split?

The reverse stock split became effective at the time of its approval by Rosetta’s shareholders on March 16, 2017, and the first day of post-split trading of our ordinary shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market will be on Friday, March 17, 2017.

6.	What is the effect of the reverse stock split on the registration and trading of our ordinary shares?

The reverse stock split will have no impact on the registration of our ordinary shares.  However, our CUSIP number will change to M82183209 effective March 17, 2017 (the old CUSIP number was M82183126).   

7.	What is the effect of the reverse stock split on the par value of our ordinary shares?

The par value of our ordinary shares will change from NIS 0.06 to NIS 7.2.

8.	How will the reverse stock split be implemented?

The implementation of the reverse stock split will differ depending on whether you are a beneficial holder with shares held in street name through an authorized broker or whether you are a registered holder with shares registered directly in your name.  

If you are a beneficial holder, holding shares via a broker or other nominee, the number of shares you hold will automatically be adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split on the effective date, subject to your broker’s particular processes with respect to these types of transactions.  No fractional ordinary shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split and any fractional shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole share number.  If you have questions with respect to how your broker will process the reverse stock split, you should contact your broker.  

If you are a registered holder, in exchange for a properly completed letter of transmittal and your certificates representing pre-split ordinary shares, our transfer agent and exchange agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC (AST), will issue your post-split ordinary shares through the exchange process outlined in question 10 below.

9.	What if I do not own a number of shares that is divisible by twelve?  Will you issue fractional shares?

We will not issue fractional shares to our shareholders in connection with the reverse stock split.  Instead, fractional shares will be rounded up to the nearest whole share number.

10.	How do I exchange my stock certificates?

If you are a beneficial holder, no action is required on your part because your broker will handle the required paperwork and communication.

If you are a registered holder, shortly after the reverse stock split is effective, you will receive a mailing from AST explaining the exchange process and the letter of transmittal.

The letter of transmittal is the form generally used for an exchange of stock.  You will receive a letter of transmittal form to complete and return along with your stock certificates to exchange the pre-split ordinary shares you hold for the post-split ordinary shares to which you are entitled.

As part of the reverse stock split and in exchange for your surrendered certificates, you will be entitled to receive a number of ordinary shares equal to one-twelfth the number of ordinary shares represented by the surrendered certificates, rounded up to the nearest whole share.

11.	What if I cannot find my stock certificates?

If your stock certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed, follow the instructions provided in the letter of transmittal or call AST Toll free at 1-877-248-6417 or 718-921-8124 during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday – Friday. 

12.	What if I am a registered holder and I take no action?

You will not receive a stock certificate representing your new, post-split ordinary shares until you submit your original stock certificates, together with your properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, to AST.  We encourage you to follow the instructions in the letter of transmittal.  Shareholders should not submit any stock certificates until requested to do so.

13.	Will I receive new paper stock certificates?

If you are a registered holder (i.e., you currently have paper stock certificates), you will receive a new, post-split paper certificate in exchange for your old, pre-split paper certificates once you follow the exchange process outlined in question 10 above.

14.	What is the effect of the reverse stock split on stock options issued under Rosetta’s employee benefit plans?

The reverse stock split reduced the number of ordinary shares reserved and available for issuance under our employee benefit plans.  Accordingly, the number of shares represented by each outstanding option, whether vested or unvested, will be divided by twelve and rounded up to the nearest whole share.  The exercise price per share for each option will be multiplied by twelve.  See questions 15 through 17 for more information.

15.	If I am a Rosetta option holder, does the reverse stock split impact any other terms and conditions of my outstanding option grants?

No.  The only terms that are affected by the reverse split are the number of shares issuable upon exercise and the exercise price of your options.  All other terms and conditions remain the same.  All vesting, expiration, termination provisions and the like remain as set forth in your award agreements.

16.	If I am a Rosetta option holder, will my current vesting schedule remain the same? 

Yes.  However, the number of shares that vest within each vesting period will be adjusted by dividing the number of shares that would have vested prior to the reverse stock split  by   twelve (12).  See example below:

Grant and Vesting Pre-Split:	
Shares Granted -  1,200

Grant and Vesting Post-Split: 
Shares Granted -  100

17.	If I am a Rosetta option holder, how will my options be adjusted?

All outstanding Rosetta options will be adjusted to reflect the reverse split in accordance with the adjustment formula provided in the applicable employee benefit plan to ensure equitable treatment of each outstanding option without causing negative tax consequences for any option holder.  Accordingly, as of the effective date, each outstanding option grant will be adjusted as follows:

•	the number of ordinary shares subject to each outstanding option grant shall be adjusted by dividing the number of shares subject to such option grant prior to the effective date by twelve and rounding up to the nearest whole share number; and 

•	the exercise price of each outstanding option grant shall be adjusted by multiplying the exercise price of such option grant prior to the effective date by twelve.

The following is an example of this adjustment:

Shares Granted and Outstanding: 
Pre-Split -  1,200
Reverse Split Ratio -  /12
Post-Split -  100

Exercise Price:
Pre-Split -  $2.00
Reverse Split Ratio -  x 12
Post-Split -  $24

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]
History[edit]
Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[20] to pursue commercial applications of microRNA research.[21] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ.[22] Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied by medical institutions.[4]

Rosetta Genomics Ltd. is a molecular diagnostics company with offices in Israel and the United States that uses micro-ribonucleic acid (microRNA) biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests designed to differentiate between various types of cancer.[1] The company expects the first three tests based on its technology to be submitted for regulatory approval in 2008.[2] The diagnostic tests will differentiate between squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); differentiate between adenocarcinoma and peritoneal mesothelioma;[3] and seek to identify the origin of tumors in patients representing cancer of unknown primary (CUP).[4] Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase [3] and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.[2]
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[5] In addition to its diagnostic programs, Rosetta Genomics is collaborating with Isis Pharmaceuticals to develop a microRNA-based therapy for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer.[6]

Intellectual property[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed a microRNA discovery process combining powerful informatics with high-throughput biological techniques.[7] This has led to the discovery of a large portion of today’s known human and viral microRNAs.[8]
In 2007, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Rosetta Genomics with two patents relating to microRNAs. In March 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued allowance for two of the company's patent applications on human and viral microRNAs.[9][10]
Platform technologies[edit]
Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process.[11] The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature.[12]
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[13]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs [14] which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.
Licenses and collaborations[edit]
In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer.[15] Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.[16] In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.[17]
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[18]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[19]
History[edit]
Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[20] to pursue commercial applications of microRNA research.[21] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ.[22] Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied by medical institutions.[4]

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and is second only to lung cancer in cancer-related death.1 Approximately 20-25% of women with breast cancer have HER2 positive tumors.2 While HER2 positive tumors are seen as more aggressive, HER2 positive tumors are also candidates for targeted drug therapy.
In breast cancer cases, HER2 FISH analysis helps enable the accurate assessment of a patient's HER2 status at the DNA level, with a high degree of accuracy to guide the most appropriate therapy decisions based on the patient's own genetic profile.



Shows whether the cells have extra copies of the HER2 gene
Provides HER2 FISH analysis combined with IHC analysis of other key biomarkers (ER, PR, Ki67, and PD-L1)
A virtual image-based TC/PC FISH platform is available to Pathologists
Rapid turnaround time of 3-4 days





Recommended Use

Recommended Use




The FDA approved PathVysion® HER2 DNA Probe Kit (PathVysion Kit) is designed to detect amplification of the HER2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens. Results from the PathVysion Kit are intended for use as an adjunct to existing clinical and pathologic information currently used as prognostic factors in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. 
The PathVysion Kit is indicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom Herceptin® (trastuzumab) treatment is being considered.3
This test is available up front, or as a reflex after RosettaGX Cancer Origin™ has been run and breast cancer has been determined to be the primary tumor.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

      Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer
    

      Various statements in this release concerning Rosetta's future expectations, plans and prospects including statements containing the words "expect," "believe," "will," "may," "should," "project," "estimate," "anticipated," "scheduled," and like expressions, and the negative thereof, constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and
    

      uncertainties, including, but are not limited to the following: we will require substantial additional funds to continue our operations and, if additional funds are not available, we may need to significantly scale back or cease our operations; we have a history of losses and may never be profitable; if we are unable to expand sales of our diagnostic tests in the United States, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition; if we are unable to find profitable strategic alternatives for our PersonalizeDx diagnostic testing and services business, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition; the intensely competitive biotechnology market could diminish demand for our tests and products; the market may not be receptive to any diagnostic tests or therapeutic products using our microRNA technology; we currently have limited sales, marketing or distribution experience and may in the future depend significantly on third parties to commercialize microRNA-based diagnostic tests or therapeutic products we may develop; we are largely dependent upon our distributors for the success of commercialization of our current diagnostic tests; health insurers and other third-party payors may decide not to cover our diagnostic products or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects; because of Medicare billing rules, we may not receive reimbursement for all tests provided to Medicare patients; if we fail to comply with our obligations under any licenses or related agreements, we could lose license rights that may be necessary for developing microRNA-based diagnostics and therapeutics; if we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition; we contract with a single manufacturer for the purchase of microarray chips for certain tests, and the failure of this manufacturer to supply sufficient quantities on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business; and other risk factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in Rosetta's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 20-F, as filed with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent Rosetta's views only as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. Rosetta does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements unless required by law.

Subtypes of renal tumors in kidney cancer patients have different genetic backgrounds, prognoses, and responses to surgical and medical treatment, and their differential diagnosis is a frequent challenge.
mi-KIDNEY provides that differential diagnosis with fast, standardized, and subjective classification. This molecular diagnostic test serves clinicians by differentiating the 4 main histological types of primary kidney tumors: benign oncocytoma and the 3 most common subtypes of renal cell carcinomas: clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe1.







Accurately classifies the four most common kidney tumors: benign oncocytoma, clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe1



Provides definitive results on kidney biopsies to avoid unnecessary surgeries



Overall accuracy of 95%1



Rapid turnaround time of 4-7 days

Berlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rosetta Genomics. "In parallel, the current market conditions for selling equity are not favorable to microcap companies, and we believe the terms proposed to us by potential investors are not in the best interest of our shareholders. As such, we are suspending plans to raise capital under the Form F-1 registration statement until further notice, and instead will continue to explore other means to improve our cash position. The potential sale of our PersonalizeDx business would have the benefit of bringing in non-dilutive cash as well as reducing our cash burn rate by approximately 20%. We also are pursuing opportunities to monetize certain IP assets, which represent another potential source of non-dilutive cash, and are exploring several other avenues for raising capital."MoreReply20mmichaelhuge dillution back on..maybe gets done under 1.    with warrants like 7m new shares....can you say reverse splitReplyReplies (3)00JJakeTold u so!Reply20SSamRosetta Genomics files for 16.358M offering of Class A, Class B units, WarrantsReplyReplies (2)00LLittleguy10% of market cap.

In December 2015, KIT-302 successfully achieved the primary efficacy endpoint for its Phase III clinical trial. In August 2016, the United States Patent Office issued a patent covering KIT-302.MarketOf the 27 million Americans with OA, 50% also suffer from HTN, which is also a common side effect of stand-alone OA drugs.

Hold again?Reply00JJustinVReveal is real.    I'm a recent investor to ROSG with an average buy-in price of around $2.85 and now have substantial ownership of ROSG..   Both my father and my sister had thyroid surgery because their lab tests came back as "indeterminate".  Fortunately both cases were benign !  The point being that Reveal could likely have saved $10,000's to the insurance company.This product alone is worth a $40+ million valuation now that its approved and marketed, not to mention all the other IP.  ROSG at these price levels is a crazy bargain and someone has figured it out and is accumulating.  Last chance to buy at these levels in my opinion!!!MoreReplyReplies (1)40JJustinKenny selling shares before ER?Reply00mmichaeldidnt lie...just spent to much cash.  cant sell personal dx.  giving away 80 percent if the company for 3 to 4 million bucks. will get done under 1 dollarReplyReplies (1)00vvjMichael-  We had 7.6 million in January. We should run out of cash by aug. 15 ( assuming same burn rate like last year )Hopefullly with some reduction in staff and reveal revenue the fund could last till sept 30.If personalized DX is sold it would buy another 6 weeksSo Mr. Berlin will have some good announcement in July and he will follow that up with ATM.  We need to get out  before ATM.MoreReplyReplies (3)10JJasonI predict we will hear about the sale of PersonalizedDx in July or August and it will bring in a lot more money than many of you are expecting - giving the company some very solid non-dilutive funding.  I believe there are quite a few entities out there bidding for PersonalizedDex.Reply20Show MoreTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceSolar Eclipse 2017: Stay in the Tualatin ValleyThe Tualatin ValleySponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
