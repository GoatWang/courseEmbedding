"L-3 Mobile-Vision has nearly 60,000 VHS systems across the country that over 5000 law enforcement agencies rely on. In fact, some customers are still using original equipment they purchased almost a decade ago." 
Mr. Blanco went on to say "We simply could not ignore the huge demand for VHS and discontinue this product line as other manufacturers are doing. So, we went back to the drawing board to update and upgrade System 7. We are also very pleased to be able to offer it BELOW its' previously listed retail price." 
The new System7 PRO has been specifically (re)designed to incorporate the benefits of new technologies and yet keep the cost-efficiency, reliability and evidentiary value of its' predecessor. Key new features include: 

Built-in GPS which provides longitude/latitude and vehicle speed as well as sets system clock and synchronizes all agency vehicles to real/actual time.

A compact universal monitor console with backlit controls and flexible mounting hardware allow it to be fitted to any vehicle type.
L-3 Mobile-Vision's patented VoiceLink Plus® 900 MHz wireless microphone which provides interference-free audio is now a standard feature.
