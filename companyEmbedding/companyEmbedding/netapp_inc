History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]
Products[edit]
Main article: NetApp filer

The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]
Products[edit]
Main article: NetApp filer




NetApp FAS3240 (second from bottom) with three DS4243 shelves on top


The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]
Products[edit]
Main article: NetApp filer




NetApp FAS3240 (second from bottom) with three DS4243 shelves on top


The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

NetApp Data Fabric Drives 24X7 Product Development, Speeds Data Recovery






 
SUNNYVALE, Calif., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- “The Shield, our vision for long-term high availability, protects our data as it moves seamlessly between our three primary data centers, 125 sites and 65 data centers around the world,” says Phil Colon, senior director of global infrastructure services at ON Semiconductor. “With NetApp, we were able to transform our vision to a reality and leverage a Data Fabric to enable connectivity and replication across all sites with failover for unplanned downtime.”
ON Semiconductor is driving energy efficient innovations in almost every industry, including automotive, electronics, computers, and healthcare. As a result of a series of strategic acquisitions, ON Semiconductor now has 125 manufacturing sites and 68 data centers around the world. For many years, every site was responsible for its own IT, but as the company grew it became increasingly difficult to maintain high availability worldwide. The company chose NetApp to help it consolidate its footprint and simplify its SAN environment across all 125 global manufacturing sites. Several of these sites deploy NetApp® (NASDAQ:NTAP) All Flash FAS and hybrid arrays, which run NetApp ONTAP® software, the industry’s leading data management solution.  To support high performance and availability for critical enterprise applications, ON Semiconductor added NetApp All Flash FAS arrays to its primary data center in Colorado.  NetApp professional services team members helped the company provide onsite support to its engineers. This included focus on storage infrastructure management and identifying ways to continue to drive consolidation over time. With its new approach, ON Semiconductor’s application performance increased by an average of 50%, with speeds for individual applications increasing as much as 64%.  The company was able to consolidate 84 racks of storage to just 24 in its new primary data center. It saw costs fall by 30% due to a reduction of 40% in power consumption. ON Semiconductor also reduced recovery time objectives (RTO) by 26% (from 5 days to 3.5 days) and recovery point objectives (RPO) by 50% (from 48 to 24 hours). Today, ON Semiconductor’s vision for Shield has progressed to deliver a robust disaster recovery approach, with NetApp SnapMirror® replicating data across geographies to ensure minimal downtime and data loss in the event of a disaster.  ON Semiconductor now has the infrastructure in place to scale its storage seamlessly without impacting ongoing operations.

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]
Products[edit]
Main article: NetApp filer




NetApp FAS3240 (second from bottom) with three DS4243 shelves on top


The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]
Products[edit]
Main article: NetApp filer




NetApp FAS3240 (second from bottom) with three DS4243 shelves on top


The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

History[edit]




NetApp headquarters in Sunnyvale, California


NetApp was founded in 1992 by David Hitz, James Lau,[6] and Michael Malcolm.[4][7] At the time, its major competitor was Auspex Systems. In 1994, NetApp received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital.[8] It had its initial public offering in 1995. NetApp thrived in the internet bubble years of the mid 1990s to 2001, during which the company grew to $1 billion in annual revenue. After the bubble burst, NetApp's revenues quickly declined to $800 million in its fiscal year 2002. Since then, the company's revenue has steadily climbed.
In 2006, NetApp sold the NetCache product line to Blue Coat Systems. In 2014, NetApp acquired Riverbed Technology's SteelStore line of data backup and protection products,[9] which it later renamed as AltaVault.[10] On June 1, 2015, Tom Georgens stepped down as CEO and was replaced by George Kurian.[11][12]
In December 2015 (closing in January 2016), NetApp acquired flash storage vendor SolidFire for $870 million.[13]
Competition[edit]
NetApp competes in the computer data storage hardware industry.[14] In 2009, NetApp ranked second in market capitalization in its industry behind EMC Corporation and ahead of Seagate Technology, Western Digital, Brocade, Imation, and Quantum.[15] In total revenue of 2009, NetApp ranked behind EMC, Seagate, Western Digital, and ahead of Imation, Brocade, Xyratex, and Hutchinson Technology.[16] According to a 2014 IDC report, NetApp ranked second in the network storage industry "Big 5's list", behind EMC(DELL), and ahead of IBM, HP and Hitachi.[17]

The line of NetApp filers has served as the company's flagship product from the very beginning. A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called network-attached storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like IBM, EMC Corporation, and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided.
NetApp's filers initially used NFS and SMB protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016[update] NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol.
The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology and other operating systems.[18] Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for SMB, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). In June 16, 2006[19] NetApp provided two variants of Data ONTAP. Data ONTAP 7G and a nearly complete rewrite[18] called Data ONTAP GX, based upon grid technology acquired from Spinnaker Networks. In 2010 these software product lines merged into one OS - Data ONTAP 8, which folded Data ONTAP 7G onto the Data ONTAP GX cluster platform. Data ONTAP 8 has two distinct operating modes - 7-Mode and Cluster-Mode.
NetApp's OnCommand management software controls and automates data-storage.[20]
Reception[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Syrian surveillance[edit]
In November 2011, during the 2011 Syrian uprising, NetApp was named as one of several companies whose products were being used in the Syrian government crackdown. The equipment was allegedly sold to the Syrians by an authorized NetApp reseller.[21]
On April 7, 2014, NetApp was notified by the US Department of Commerce "that it had completed its review of this matter and determined that NetApp had not violated the U.S. export laws", and that the file on the matter had been closed.[22]
Legal dispute with Sun Microsystems[edit]
In September 2007, NetApp started proceedings against Sun Microsystems, claiming that the ZFS File System developed by Sun infringed its patents.[23] The following month, Sun announced plans to countersue based on alleged misuse by NetApp of Sun's own patented technology.[24] Several of NetApp's patent claims were rejected on the basis of prior art after re-examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[25] On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits.[26]
Accolades[edit]
NetApp was listed amongst Silicon Valley Top 25 Corporate Philanthropists in 2013.[27]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
