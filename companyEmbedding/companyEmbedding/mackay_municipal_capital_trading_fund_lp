MainStay High Yield Opportunities Fund and MainStay Unconstrained Bond Fund: Short sales involve costs and risk. If a security sold short increases in price, the Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price, resulting in a loss. Because the Fund’s loss on a short sale arises from increases in the value of the security sold short, such loss is theoretically unlimited. When borrowing a security for delivery to a buyer, the Fund also may be required to pay a premium and other transaction costs, which would increase the cost of the security sold short. By investing the proceeds received from selling securities short, the Fund is employing a form of leverage, which creates special risks. The use of leverage may increase the Fund’s exposure to long equity positions and make any change in the Fund’s NAV greater than it would be without the use of leverage. This could result in increased volatility of returns. High-yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher-quality debt securities and may be subject to greater price volatility. Floating rate loans are generally considered to have speculative characteristics that involve default risk of principal and interest, collateral impairment, borrower industry concentration, and limited liquidity. Issuers of convertible securities may not be as financially strong as those issuing securities with higher credit ratings and may be more vulnerable to changes in the economy.
MainStay Global High Income Fund: Foreign securities may be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than for developed markets. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which may increase the volatility of the Fund’s NAV and may result in a loss to the Fund. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest-rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk, in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner.

MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond Fund and MainStay Tax Free Bond Fund: A portion of the Funds’ income may be subject to state and local taxes or the alternative minimum tax. High-yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher-quality debt securities and may be subject to greater price volatility. High-yield municipal bonds may be subject to increased liquidity risk as compared to other high-yield debt securities. The Funds may invest in derivatives, which may increase the volatility of the Funds’ net asset value and may result in a loss to the Funds. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest-rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk, in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perception of the issuer’s ability to make such payments may cause the price of that bond to decline. Municipal securities risks include the inability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of information about certain issuers, and the possibility of future tax and legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Such uncertainties could cause increased volatility in the municipal securities market and could negatively impact the Funds’ net asset value and/or the distributions paid by the Funds. Securities purchased by the Funds that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions or investor perceptions.
MainStay Convertible Fund: Issuers of convertible securities may not be as financially strong as those issuing securities with higher credit ratings and may be more vulnerable to changes in the economy. High-yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher-quality debt securities and may be subject to greater price volatility.

Municipal bond risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of information about certain issuers, and the possibility of future tax and legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities.
Commodities are investments in instruments and companies that are susceptible to fluctuations in certain commodity markets. Any negative changes in commodity markets (that may be due to changes in supply and demand for commodities, market S-4 events, regulatory developments or other factors) could have an adverse impact on those companies.
Floating rate funds are generally considered to have speculative characteristics that involve default risk of principal and interest, collateral impairment, non-diversification, borrower industry concentration, and limited liquidity. The Funds may invest in foreign securities. U.S. dollar- denominated securities of foreign issuers can be subject to different risks than U.S. investments, including less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in U.S. or foreign tax or currency laws and monetary policy.
Alternative investments are speculative, not suitable for all clients, and intended for experienced and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risks of the investment.
Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.
High-yield securities (junk bonds) have speculative characteristics and present a greater risk of loss than higher quality debt securities. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk which is the possibility that the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner.
Active share is a method of determining the extent of active management employed by an investment manager and a significant tool for helping investors find those active managers that do outperform their benchmarks. Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Credit spread is the difference in yield between a U.S. Treasury bond and a debt security with the same maturity but of lesser quality. Fed Funds Rate is the rate at which a depository institution lends funds maintained at the Federal Reserve to another depository institution overnight. Intercontinental Exchange London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a benchmark rate that some of the world’s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans. It serves as the first step to calculating interest rates on various loans throughout the world. Smart beta defines a set of investment strategies that emphasize the use of alternative index construction rules to traditional market capitalization based indices. Sovereign debt is a central government's debt. It is issued by the national government in a foreign currency in order to finance the issuing country's growth and development. Valuation is the process of determining the current worth of an asset or a company. Yield curve is a line that plots the interest rates, at a set point in time,of bonds having equal credit quality, but differing maturity dates.
