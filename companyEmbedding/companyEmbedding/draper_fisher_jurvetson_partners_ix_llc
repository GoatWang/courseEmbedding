History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Draper Fisher Jurvetson - Silicon Valley office

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

Heidi Roizen
Operating Partner

    









I don't need to know how to build a car in order to benefit from it – I just need to know how to drive one.* The massive power of technology innovation is only unlocked when 'mere mortals' can use that technology to improve their lives. * and soon I won't even need to know how to do that!  								
  								Heidi Roizen represents the voice of the entrepreneur, having been one herself. But she also represents the voice of the user, as those are the roots that led her to start a company in the first place.

At Stanford majoring in English, she went from a Corona typewriter with Wite-Out (Google it) to an early word processor— and deemed it "a religious experience." She co-founded a software company with her programmer brother Peter to bring the benefits of personal computing to 'mere mortals' – non-techies. That mission has shaped her philosophy and her work ever since.

After Heidi earned her undergraduate and MBA degrees from Stanford, she co-founded T-Maker, where she served as CEO for over a decade through its acquisition by Deluxe Corporate in 1994. Next, she joined Apple as VP of worldwide developer relations, and from there, Mobius Venture Capital. She's since been named to the Corporate Board Member's "Top 50 Women in Tech" list and Hot Topics' Top 100 Women in Tech. She has earned the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs and Executives Annual Achievement Award, among other accolades.

In addition to being DFJ's operating partner, Heidi co-leads the DFJ Entrepreneurial Leaders Fellowship Program in the Management Science and Engineering department at Stanford University. She's on the board of directors of Intematix, ShareThis, Zoox, and DMGT (LSE:DMGT).   

She has served on more than 30 boards, so it's no surprise that she sees patterns. She understands how stuff works and can spot opportunities and potential challenges, often before others do. And, because she has been in their shoes, Heidi has tremendous understanding of – and empathy for – the entrepreneur's journey.

  								Tim Draper is the founding partner of Draper Associates and DFJ. Tim’s original suggestion to use viral marketing as a method for spreading a software application from customer to customer was instrumental to the successes of Hotmail, Skype, and others. 

Tim has been recognized as a leading supporter of entrepreneurship with numerous awards and honors. He was listed as #46 of the most outstanding Harvard alumni, #7 on the Forbes Midas List, #1 of the Most Networked Venture Capitalists by Always On, and #98 in Worth Magazine’s 100 Most Powerful People in Finance. Tim also received the World Entrepreneurship Forum’s “Entrepreneur for the World” in 2015. 

Tim received a BS from Stanford University with a major in electrical engineering and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.

He served on the California State Board of Education in 1998-1999, and currently leads an initiative to create six new states in California (Six Californias) to encourage competition and choice in government.

In 1994, he created a non-profit for young children to learn about business and entrepreneurship called BizWorld. In 2011, he created Draper University of Heroes, a residential and online school to help extraordinary young people meet their entrepreneurial goals.
