Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Series                                      
Monthly Report                                                                  
November 2000                                                                   

Dear Limited Partner:                                                           

The Net Asset Value per Unit for each of the six Morgan Stanley Dean Witter     
Spectrum Funds as of November 30, 2000 was as follows:                          

Funds                    N.A.V.                   % change for month            
Spectrum Commodity       $  7.76                          3.82%                 
Spectrum Currency        $10.81                          -1.63%                 
Spectrum Global Balanced $15.37                          -0.51%                 
Spectrum Select          $21.72                           6.48%                 
Spectrum Strategic       $  9.58                          6.47%                 
Spectrum Technical       $14.35                          12.34%                 

In general, the performance disparity between the Funds in the Spectrum         
Series is due to the portfolio structure and trading approaches unique to       
each Fund.  Spectrum Technical, a technically-based multi-manager fund,         
recorded profits primarily in the interest rate futures and energy markets.     
Spectrum Strategic, a fund managed by multiple trading advisors who employ      
fundamental trading methodologies, recorded gains primarily in the interest     
rate futures and currency markets.  Spectrum Select, the other technically-     
based multi-manager fund, produced gains primarily in the interest rate         
futures and energy markets.  Spectrum Commodity, a fund that participates       
in the tangible commodity markets from the long side, recorded gains            
primarily in the energy markets.  Spectrum Global Balanced, a balanced          
portfolio of stocks, bonds and managed futures, incurred losses primarily       
in global stock index futures and currency markets.  Spectrum Currency, a       
fund that participates exclusively in the currency markets, experienced         
losses primarily from trading in European currencies.                           

Spectrum Commodity                                                              

The Fund increased in value during November primarily as a result of gains      
recorded in the energy markets from long positions in natural gas futures       
as prices moved higher amid forecasts for cold weather in the U.S.              
Northeast and after an unexpected decrease in U.S. natural gas inventories.     
Additional gains were recorded from long futures positions in crude oil and     
its related products as prices increased following data showing supplies of     
heating oil are extremely tight heading into the winter heating season and      
on forecasts for chilly weather in the U.S. Northeast.  In the agricultural     
markets, gains were recorded from long futures positions in soybeans and        
soybean meal as prices increased on assumptions that Germany would ban the      
use of bone and meat meal as animal feed.  A portion of these gains was         
offset by losses recorded in the soft commodities markets from long coffee      
futures positions as prices declined pressured by forecasts calling for         
periodic rain showers in key coffee growing areas of Brazil.  Additional        
losses were experienced from long positions in cocoa futures as prices          
moved lower as the market was influenced by harvest pressure from the Ivory     
Coast.                                                                          

Spectrum Currency                                                               

The Fund decreased in value during November primarily due to losses             
recorded from short positions in the euro as the value of the European          
common currency strengthened versus the U.S. dollar late in the month on        
fresh evidence that the U.S. economy is cooling down.  Additional losses        
were recorded from long British pound positions as the value of the pound       
weakened relative to the U.S. dollar on the release of disappointing            
economic data out of the U.K.  Smaller losses were experienced from short       
Singapore dollar positions as its value was boosted against the U.S. dollar     
after the Japanese yen's gains versus the U.S. dollar increased the             
strength of Pacific Rim currencies towards month-end.  A portion of overall     
Fund losses was offset by gains recorded from short South African rand          
positions as its value weakened versus the U.S. dollar, while moving in         
sympathy with other emerging market currencies.  Additional gains were          
experienced early in the month from short Japanese yen positions as the         
value of the yen weakened versus the U.S. dollar due to concerns over           
political and economic woes in Japan.

The Fund decreased in value during November primarily as a result of losses     
recorded in the global stock index futures markets from long positions in       
FTSE and DAX Index futures as European stock prices declined later in the       
month on nervousness over high-tech earnings growth.  In the currency           
markets, losses were incurred early in the month from short positions in        
the Singapore dollar as its value strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar      
after the Japanese yen's gains versus the U.S. dollar increased the             
strength of Pacific Rim currencies towards month-end.  Newly established        
long positions in the Singapore dollar resulted in additional losses as its     
value weakened versus the U.S. dollar, mainly from uncertainties in Asian       
currencies due to ongoing political issues in the some countries in the         
Pacific Rim region.  In the energy markets, losses were experienced later       
in the month from long futures positions in crude oil and its refined           
products as prices dropped following news of a second straight weekly           
surprise rise in inventories.  Additional downward price pressure came as       
news that Iraq has stopped loading crude for export was offset by               
assurances that the U.S., the International Energy Agency and Saudi Arabia      
are prepared to make up for any lost oil.  A portion of these losses was        
offset by gains recorded in the global interest rate futures markets from       
long positions in U.S. and German interest rate futures as U.S. and             
European government bond prices moved higher while the U.S. equity markets      
continued their sharp decline amid continuing uncertainty brought about by      
the U.S. Presidential Election.  Profits were also recorded from long           
positions in Japanese bond futures as prices rose sharply on investor           
buying as sluggish stocks in both the U.S. and Japan indicated fears for a      
possible economic downturn.

franc as the value of these European currencies strengthened relative to        
the U.S. dollar later in the month on concerns about slowing U.S. growth        
and persistent declines in U.S. stocks.

amid continuing uncertainty brought about by the U.S. Presidential              
Election.  In the currency markets, gains were recorded from long crossrate     
positions in the euro relative to the Japanese yen, short positions in the      
Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar and long positions in the euro and the      
Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar.  The value of the yen weakened         
versus the euro and U.S. dollar due to concerns over political and economic     
woes in Japan.  The euro and Swiss franc strengthened relative to the U.S.      
dollar late in the month on concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth and     
persistent declines in U.S. stocks prices.  In soft commodities, gains were     
incurred earlier in the month from long cotton futures positions as prices      
climbed higher on an increase in global demand.  A portion of these gains       
was offset by losses recorded in the global stock index futures markets         
from long positions in NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 Index futures as domestic         
stock prices declined, particularly technology-based stocks, due to             
earnings warnings from several companies.  In the energy markets, losses        
were experienced earlier in the month from short futures positions in crude     
oil as prices increased following data showing supplies of heating oil are      
extremely tight heading into the winter heating season and on forecasts for     
chilly weather in the U.S. Northeast.  Offsetting gains were incurred from

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                  

Organization - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Commodity                    
L.P. ("Spectrum Commodity," formerly Morgan Stanley Tangible                    
Asset Fund L.P.), Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Currency                  
L.P. ("Spectrum Currency"), Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum                 
Global Balanced L.P. ("Spectrum Global Balanced"), Morgan                       
Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Select L.P. ("Spectrum Select"),                   
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Strategic L.P. ("Spectrum
Strategic") and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Technical                   
L.P. ("Spectrum Technical"), (individually, a "Partnership", or                 
collectively, the "Partnerships"), are limited partnerships                     
organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of                     
futures, forwards, and options contracts on physical                            
commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not                   
limited to foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals,                   
energy and agricultural products (collectively, "futures                        
interests").                                                                    

The general partner for each Partnership is Demeter Management                  
Corporation ("Demeter").  The non-clearing commodity broker for                 
the Partnerships is Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. ("DWR").  The                    
clearing commodity brokers for the Partnerships are Morgan                      
Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS & Co.") and Morgan Stanley &                    
Co. International ("MSIL") which provide clearing and execution                 
services.  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Commodities Management,                   
Inc. ("MSCM") is the trading advisor to Spectrum Commodity.                     
Demeter, DWR, MS & Co., MSCM and MSIL are wholly-owned                          
subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.                                

Demeter is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the                    
equity of each Partnership and income (losses) are shared by                    
Demeter and the Limited Partners based upon their proportional                  
ownership interests.                                                            

Use of Estimates - The financial statements are prepared in                     
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which                 
require management to make estimates and assumptions that                       
affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and                     
related disclosures.  Management believes that the estimates                    
utilized in the preparation of the financial statements are                     
prudent and reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those                 
estimates.                                                                      

Revenue Recognition - Futures interests are open commitments                    
until settlement date.  They are valued at market on a daily                    
basis and the resulting net change in unrealized gains and                      
losses is reflected in the changes in unrealized profits                        
(losses) on open contracts from one period to the next in the                   
statements of operations.  Monthly, DWR pays interest income on                 
80% of the month's average daily "Net Assets" (as defined in                    
the limited partnership agreements) of                                          
Spectrum Commodity, Spectrum Currency, Spectrum Select,                         
Spectrum Strategic and Spectrum Technical, and 100% in the case                 
of Spectrum Global Balanced.  The interest rates used are equal                 
to a prevailing rate on U.S. Treasury bills.  For purposes of                   
such interest payments, Net Assets do not include monies due                    
the Partnerships on futures interests, but not actually                         
received.                                                                       

Net Income (Loss) per Unit - Net income (loss) per unit of                      
limited partnership interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the                  
weighted average number of Units outstanding during the period.                 

Brokerage and Related Transaction Fees and Costs - The                          
brokerage fees for Spectrum Commodity, Spectrum Currency, and                   
Spectrum Global Balanced are accrued at a flat monthly rate of                  
1/12 of 4.6% (a 4.6% annual rate) of Net Assets as of the first                 
day of each month.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
(Continued)                                                                     

Brokerage fees for Spectrum Select, Spectrum Strategic and                      
Spectrum Technical are accrued at a flat monthly rate of 1/12                   
of 7.25% (a 7.25% annual rate) of  Net Assets as of the first                   
day of each month.                                                              

Such fees currently cover all brokerage commissions,                            
transaction fees and costs and ordinary administrative and                      
continuing offering expenses.                                                   

Operating Expenses - The Partnerships incur monthly management                  
fees and may incur incentive fees.  All common administrative                   
and continuing offering expenses including legal, auditing,                     
accounting, filing fees and other related expenses are borne by                 
DWR through the brokerage fees paid by each Partnership.                        

Income Taxes - No provision for income taxes has been made in                   
the accompanying financial statements, as partners are                          
individually responsible for reporting income or loss based                     
upon their respective share of each Partnership's revenues and                  
expenses for income tax purposes.                                               

Distributions - Distributions, other than redemptions of Units,                 
are made on a pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter.                 
No distributions have been made to date.                                        

Continuing Offering - Units of each Partnership are offered at                  
a price equal to 100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the                 
close of business on the last day of the month.  No selling                     
commissions or charges related to the continuing offering of                    
Units are borne by the Limited Partners or the Partnership.                     
DWR will pays all such costs.                                                   

Redemptions - Limited Partners may redeem some or all of their                  
Units at 100% of the Net Asset Value Per Unit as of the end of                  
the last day of any month that is at least six months after the                 
closing at which a person becomes a Limited Partner, upon five                  
business days advance notice by redemption form to Demeter.                     
Thereafter, Units redeemed on or prior to the last day of the                   
twelfth month after such Units were purchased will be subject                   
to a redemption charge equal to 2% of the Net Asset Value of a                  
Unit on the date of such redemption.  Units redeemed after the                  
last day of the twelfth month and on or prior to the last day                   
of the twenty-fourth month after which such Units were                          
purchased will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of                 
the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the date of such redemption.                   
Units redeemed after the last day of the twenty-fourth month                    
after which such Units were purchased will not be subject to a                  
redemption charge.  The foregoing redemptions charges will be                   
paid to DWR.  Redemptions must be made in whole Units, in a                     
minimum amount of 50 Units, unless a Limited Partner is                         
redeeming his entire interest in a Partnership.                                 

Exchanges - On the last day of the first month which occurs

equal to 20% of the trading profits as of the end of each                       
calendar year.

For all Partnerships, when trading losses are incurred, no

(MoneyWatch) A recent Bloomberg news article on a managed futures fund managed by Morgan Stanley  caught the attention of my colleague Kevin Grogan. The article describes how several managed futures funds offered through a limited partnership structure charged fees that were so high that they wiped out any gain for the investor.
Managed futures are alternative investments that performed well in 2008, when equities and most other alternative strategies did poorly. Unfortunately, this good past performance made investors ripe for pitches for complicated, opaque, high-fee managed futures funds. Here is a summary of the highlights (or lowlights) of these strategies cited in the article:
The Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical LP fund made $490 million in trading gains and income from 2003 to 2012. However, these profits did not accrue to the investors who bore all the risks. Instead, Morgan Stanley and the fund managers made $499 million in commissions, expenses and fees.
According to the SEC, 89 percent of the $11.5 billion of gains in 63 managed futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses from 2003 to 2012.
Brokers who sell these products have an incentive to keep clients in managed futures funds because they receive commissions annually of up to 4 percent of assets invested. Investors pay as much as 9 percent in total fees each year.
The prospectus of some of these funds allow their managers to make "side bets" by trading ahead or opposite the fund's trades -- a clear conflict of interest, and a red flag if ever there was one.
Ken Steben, the manager of a managed futures fund marketed by Wells Fargo and Ameriprise, made a shocking admission: "Most individual investors don't understand what we're doing. In many cases, the financial advisers don't completely understand it."


Three important takeaways for investors

Fees matter: Clearly, managed futures strategies delivered on their "promise"  -- gross of fees. Unfortunately, the only returns investors can spend are net of fees and expenses (including taxes).
Beware of conflicts of interest: The brokers who sold these strategies were heavily incented to do so. Also, the fact that fund managers are allowed to front-run or trade opposite their own fund's trades is a huge red flag.
Warren Buffet once advised to "never invest in a business you can't understand." This advice could be extended to all types of investing. If you don't understand the investment, it is best to stay away.Image courtesy of Flickr user Taxbrackets.org

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) investment in SECOR Master Fund, (ii) equity in trading account, consisting of cash at MS&Co. and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts, and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (iii) cash at bank and (iv) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its direct investments and investment in SECOR Master Fund. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of 2017.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, forward, options, swaps and other derivatives trading and U.S. treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by net realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Units, and distributions of profit, if any.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Partnership capital decreased 7.7% from $62,870,541 to $58,059,097. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 250,413.852 limited partner Units totaling $4,394,936 coupled with a net loss of $416,508. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods.  Other than as discussed above, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The General Partner believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnership's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," of the financial statements.  The Partnership and SECOR Master Fund record all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and option markets.  Aspect trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system. The Diversified Program is a proprietary, systematic global futures trading program. Its goal is the generation of significant long-term capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns. This program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial, currency and commodity markets, searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months.  Aspect has designed the Diversified Program to have broad market diversification (subject to liquidity constraints). Aspect's quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets.  Aspect's Diversified Program trades in over 100 markets in the seven major sectors: currencies, energy, metals, stock indices, bonds, agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies. Aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its reward/risk ratio and capacity. Aspect has no market or sector preferences, believing that, allowing for liquidity effects, equal profitability can be achieved in the long-term in all markets. The key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity. Correlations are analyzed at the sector, sub-sector, economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified.  Campbell trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Financial, Metal Energy Large Portfolio, a proprietary, systematic trading program. Campbell's trading models are designed to detect and exploit medium-term to long-term price changes, while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles.  Campbell believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification, and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded. Every trading model may not trade every market. It is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market. It is Campbell's intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading, but if the signals are not simultaneous, both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable, in retrospect, one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary. It is Campbell's policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models.  SECOR's investment objectives are to generate high risk-adjusted returns by:  FORT trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Global Contrarian Program, a systematic, technical, trend-anticipating trading program. Global Contrarian's investment objective is to achieve attractive absolute returns and reduced volatility of returns primarily through trading a broad spectrum of futures contracts, including contracts on short-term interest rates, bonds, currencies, stock indices energy and metals.  Global Contrarian generally seeks to anticipate and capitalize on short-to-intermediate-term trends (two to six weeks). Unlike a trend-following program, which would attempt to identify existing trends, Global Contrarian attempts to anticipate trends before they occur. Global Contrarian takes positions while the market is moving against the signal. As a result, its performance can be much more volatile than traditional trend-following models, but the potential for diversification is much greater. In an attempt to reduce the volatility of returns, the allocation of capital is geographically diversified across Asia, Europe, Australia and North America. FORT exercises little or no discretion over the rule-based and computerized trading signals generated by Global Contrarian. Global Contrarian uses Bayesian learning techniques to systematically adjust model parameters, markets, and sectors. The learning process favors both winners and losers for allocations. For example, markets that underperform recently but perform well over the long-term are candidates for allocation.  The General Partner is not aware of any material changes to any of the trading programs discussed above during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Prior to March 31, 2016, Winton traded the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system. The Diversified Program trades approximately 95 futures and forward contracts on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and markets.  Winton employed a fully systematic, computerized, technical, trend-following trading system developed by its principals. This system tracks the daily price movements from these markets around the world, and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be in an attempt to maximize profit within a certain range of risk. If rising prices in a particular market are anticipated, a long position will be established in that market; if prices in a particular market are expected to fall, a short position in that market will be established.  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and the change during the three months ended March 31, 2017.   Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Change March 31, December 31, March 31, December 31, during the Trading Advisor 2017 (%) 2016 (%) 2017 ($) 2016 ($) period (%) Aspect 23.24 % 24.67 % $ 13,494,499 $ 15,508,360 (12.99) % Campbell 17.00 18.29 9,868,256 11,501,702 (14.20) SECOR 31.72 31.07 18,416,982 19,534,301 (5.72) FORT 28.04 25.97 16,279,360 16,326,178 (0.29)  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership and SECOR Master trade are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts" and "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from SECOR Master Fund" and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" and "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from SECOR Master Fund" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis, as applicable. The Partnership records its investment in SECOR Master Fund at fair value on the basis of the net asset value of such investments.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  During the Partnership's first quarter of 2017, the net asset value per Unit decreased 0.7% from $17.59 to $17.46, as compared to an increase of 0.5% during the first quarter of 2016. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2017 of $369,433. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's/SECOR Master Fund's trading of Futures Interests in indices and livestock and were partially offset by losses in currencies, energy, grains, U.S. and non-U.S.interest rates, metals and softs. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2016 of $1,979,079. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's/SECOR Master Fund's trading of Futures Interests in currencies, energy, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and were partially offset by losses in indices, metals and agriculturals.  The most significant losses were incurred within the global interest rate markets, primarily during March, from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices declined amid speculation of growing hawkish sentiment in central banks across the globe. Within the energy sector, losses were incurred primarily during January from positions in gasoline futures as prices moved without consistent direction throughout the month amid speculation regarding the surplus of U.S. gasoline supplies as refineries head into spring maintenance season. Additional losses were incurred during January from long positions in natural gas futures as prices decreased amid limited demand due to milder-than-normal temperatures in North America. Losses were recorded with the currency markets during March from short positions in the euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the dollar depreciated following comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve which caused investors to revise expectations for further interest rate hikes in 2017. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during January from short positions in coffee futures as prices advanced amid a decline in production and supply from major coffee-growing countries. Additional losses in the agricultural sector were incurred from positions in wheat, corn, and soybeans. Within the metals sector, losses were incurred during March from long positions in gold and silver futures as prices retreated during the first half of the month as rising interest rates diminished precious metal demand. Further losses were recorded throughout the first quarter from positions in lead, nickel, and tin. The Partnership's losses for the quarter were offset by gains experienced within the global stock index sector, primarily during January and February, from long positions in U.S. and European equity index futures as prices rallied amid renewed bullishness about President Donald Trump's policies, in particular those relating to tax reform and the impact they may have on economic growth. Additional gains were recorded in this sector during March.  May 11, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as clearing commodity broker in separate Futures Interests trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in Futures Interests, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests, may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its (i) equity in trading account, consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (ii) cash at bank and (iii) interest receivable. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in Futures Interests in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in Futures Interests markets.  Aspect trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system. The Diversified Program is a proprietary, systematic global futures trading program. Its goal is the generation of significant long-term capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns. This program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial, currency and commodity markets, searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months.  Aspect has designed the Diversified Program to have broad market diversification (subject to liquidity constraints). Aspect's quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets.  Aspect's Diversified Program trades over 100 markets in the seven major sectors:  Campbell trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Financial, Metal Energy Large Portfolio, a proprietary, systematic trading program. Campbell's trading models are designed to detect and exploit medium-term to long-term price changes, while also applying risk management and portfolio management principles.  Campbell believes that utilizing multiple trading models provides an important level of diversification, and is most beneficial when multiple contracts of each market are traded. Every trading model may not trade every market. It is possible that one trading model may signal a long position while another trading model signals a short position in the same market. It is Campbell's intention to offset those signals to reduce unnecessary trading, but if the signals are not simultaneous, both trades will be taken and since it is unlikely that both positions would prove profitable, in retrospect, one or both trades will appear to have been unnecessary. It is Campbell's policy to follow trades signaled by each trading model independently of the other models.  SECOR's investment objectives are to generate high risk-adjusted returns by:  FORT trades the allocated portion of the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Global Contrarian Program, a systematic, technical, trend-anticipating trading program. Global Contrarian's investment objective is to achieve attractive absolute returns and reduced volatility of returns primarily through trading a broad spectrum of futures contracts, including contracts on short-term interest rates, bonds, currencies, stock indices energy and metals.  Global Contrarian generally seeks to anticipate and capitalize on short-to-intermediate-term trends (two to six weeks). Unlike a trend-following program, which would attempt to identify existing trends, Global Contrarian attempts to anticipate trends before they occur. Global Contrarian takes positions while the market is moving against the signal. As a result, its performance can be much more volatile than traditional trend-following models, but the potential for diversification is much greater. In an attempt to reduce the volatility of returns, the allocation of capital is geographically diversified across Asia, Europe, Australia and North America. The Adviser exercises little or no discretion over the rule-based and computerized trading signals generated by Global Contrarian. Global Contrarian uses Bayesian learning techniques to systematically adjust model parameters, markets, and sectors. The learning process favors both winners and losers for allocations. For example, markets that underperform recently but perform well over the long-term are candidates for allocation.  Winton traded the Partnership's assets in accordance with its Diversified Program, a proprietary, systematic trading system, prior to its termination effective March 31, 2016. The Diversified Program traded approximately 95 futures and forward contracts on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges and markets. Winton employed a fully systematic, computerized, technical, trend-following trading system developed by its principals. This system tracked the daily price movements from these markets around the world, and carried out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be in an attempt to maximize profit within a certain range of risk. If rising prices in a particular market were anticipated, a long position would have been established in that market; if prices in a particular market were expected to fall, a short position in that market would have been established.  Blackwater traded its Global Program on behalf of the Partnership prior to its termination effective September 30, 2015. Blackwater utilized medium and long term, systematic technical models to trade global futures and foreign exchange markets. The models were designed to establish positions when market behavior exhibits a high probability of an emerging sustained move. Blackwater sought to aggressively protect open equity after profit targets had been reached, limiting sharp reversals and drawdowns. It incorporated strict money management techniques based on individual market, sector and portfolio levels in order to reduce volatility.  Rotella traded the assets allocated to it by the Partnership pursuant to its Standard Leverage Program prior to its termination effective December 31, 2014. The primary objective of Rotella's Standard Leverage Program was to capitalize on intermediate to long-term price trends in global markets through the use of statistically-based trading strategies. Rotella's investment approach was best defined as systematic tactical trading. The strategy employed an intermediate to long-term holding period where the average trade duration was more than ten trading days and less than forty trading days and portfolio turnover was expected to range from one-thousand to three-thousand round-turn contracts per year per million dollars invested. The strategy attempted to participate in intermediate to long-term market trends through the use of an array of sophisticated quantitative models.  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and the change during the applicable period.   Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Change December 31, September 30, December 31, September 30, during the Trading Advisor 2016 (%) 2016 (%) 2016 ($) 2016 ($) period (%) Aspect 24.67 % 26.18 % $ 15,508,360 $ 19,185,222 (19.17) % Campbell 18.29 19.62 11,501,702 14,379,766 (20.01) SECOR 31.07 28.61 19,534,301 20,968,527 (6.84) FORT 25.97 25.59 16,326,178 18,751,459 (12.93)  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"), which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts" and "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from Blackwater Master Fund" and "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from SECOR Master Fund" for open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts", "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from Blackwater Master Fund" and "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from SECOR Master Fund" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, General Partner fees, ongoing placement agent fees, and brokerage fees as applicable, of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis. The Partnership records its investment in SECOR Master Fund, and recorded its investment in Blackwater Master Fund, at fair value on the basis of the net asset value of such investments.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 7.2% from $18.95 to $17.59. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit decreased 0.6% from $19.07 to $18.95. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit increased 15.2% from $16.55 to $19.07.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,116,946 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the energy, indices, metals and softs, and were partially offset by gains in currencies and U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The most significant losses were recorded in the metals sector during February, March, and April from short positions in gold and silver futures as prices advanced amid increased investor demand for precious metals. Additional losses were incurred during October from long lead futures positions as prices decreased as the U.S. dollar strengthened and large speculators cut their net-long positions. Further losses in the metals sector were incurred throughout the year from positions in copper, zinc, and platinum futures. Within the energy sector, losses were incurred during April from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices surged as data from the Energy Information Agency showed U.S. crude oil production continued to decline. Additional losses were recorded during August from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied amid speculation that crude producers would revive talks to stabilize prices at informal OPEC discussions in September. Within the global stock index sector, losses were incurred during June from long positions in Pacific Rim equity index futures as prices declined on mounting uncertainties following the U.K's decision to leave the European Union. Additional losses were incurred during January from long positions in European equity index futures as prices declined amid investor concerns about declining oil prices and a China-led slowdown in global growth. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during March from short positions in coffee futures as prices were boosted by a combination of fund buying, a weaker U.S. dollar, and concerns about dry weather in Colombia and Vietnam. Meanwhile, agricultural losses were also incurred throughout the second half of the year from mixed positioning in corn futures as prices moved without consistent direction. The Partnership's trading losses for the year were partially offset by trading gains within the global interest rate sector during January and February from long positions in European and Pacific Rim fixed income futures as prices advanced after weakness in Chinese economic data revived concern about the stability of the global economy. Additional gains were experienced during June from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the U.K.'s vote in late June to leave the European Union increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced during October from short positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the pound continued to weaken due to concerns regarding the political and economic implications of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union. Additional gains were experienced throughout the year from positions in the Japanese yen, Swedish krona, Turkish lira, and Brazilian real.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $6,239,846 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in energy and metals were offset by trading losses in the agricultural, currency, and global fixed income sectors. Trading results in the global stock index sector were relatively flat for the year and had no material impact on the Partnership's performance.  The most significant losses were incurred in the agricultural sector primarily during June and July from long positions in corn, wheat, and soybean futures as prices declined amid concerns that China's slowing economy would dampen demand for the commodities, even as favorable weather continued to bolster domestic supplies. Additional losses in the agricultural sector were incurred throughout much of the year from long positions in cotton futures. Within the currency sector, losses were incurred primarily during April and August from short positions in the Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar declined as fears over a hard landing in China and its impact on global growth outlook pushed back expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike at the September FOMC meeting. During January, additional currency losses were incurred from short positions in the Swiss franc as the value of the Swiss franc soared against currencies globally after the Switzerland central bank abandoned its exchange-rate cap, which maintained a minimum exchange-rate for the Swiss franc against the euro. Within the global interest rate sector, losses were incurred primarily during February from long positions in U.S. fixed income futures, specifically in U.S. Treasury note and Treasury bond futures, as prices declined after a stronger-than-expected U.S. employment report boosted speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates earlier than previously anticipated. Additional fixed income losses were incurred during the fourth quarter from long positions in U.S. and European fixed income futures after prices reversed sharply lower as European Central Bank ("ECB") president Mario Draghi disappointed markets early in December with an underwhelming ECB stimulus announcement. The Partnership's trading losses during the year were partially offset by trading gains within the energy markets, primarily during November and December, from short positions in crude oil futures as prices continued to decline as U.S. crude supplies rose and OPEC production increased, signaling the global supply glut will persist. Further gains in this sector were recorded during July and September. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced during November from short positions in copper futures as prices declined as tepid economic data from China continued to dampen demand prospects amidst global oversupply. Additional gains in metals were recorded during July from short positions in gold and copper futures.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $21,773,211 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the global interest rate, energy, currency, and agricultural sectors more than offset losses in the global stock index and metals sectors.  The most significant gains were recorded within the global interest rate sector, primarily during August, from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced after reports showed euro-area manufacturing output expanded less than expected during July, boosting speculation the European Central Bank would increase stimulus measures. Additional gains were recorded during the fourth quarter as prices continued to trend higher. Within the energy sector, gains were experienced during October, November, and December from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices moved lower as U.S. oil production advanced to record levels and after OPEC decided not to reduce crude oil production amid a global supply glut. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced during September from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar. In September, the value of the U.S. dollar advanced as the U.S. employment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 and the economy added more jobs than forecast, bolstering the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2015. Additional gains in this sector were recorded from positions in the Swiss franc, Mexican Peso, and Australian dollar. Within the agricultural sector, gains were experienced during September from short positions in wheat futures as prices dropped to the lowest level in four years on speculation that rising global production will curb exports from the U.S. Additional gains were recorded from long positions in livestock futures as prices trended higher throughout a majority of the first half of the year. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the year was offset by trading losses within the global stock index sector, primarily during January, from long positions in Pacific Rim and European equity index futures as prices declined amid growing concern the global economic recovery is faltering. Additional losses were incurred during December from long positions in European equity index futures as prices fell as a decline in oil prices and manufacturing data increased concern over slowing inflation and global growth. Within the metals sector, losses were incurred primarily during January and February from short positions in gold futures as prices moved higher after geo-political turmoil and concern over the strength of the U.S. economy increased demand for the precious metal. Additional losses were incurred during January from long positions in copper futures as prices declined on speculation that rising borrowing costs in emerging markets will dampen economic growth, eroding demand for industrial metals.  For an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of 2016 trading results, refer to the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Market Risk  The Partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. The Partnership/Master Fund, trade Futures Interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership/Master Fund are subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by the Partnership at the same time, and the Trading Advisors were unable to offset positions of the Partnership/Master Fund, the Partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to 100% of their capital accounts.  In addition to the Trading Advisors' internal controls, the Trading Advisors must comply with the Partnership's/Master Fund's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The Trading Advisors and Ceres monitor the Partnership's/Master Fund's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and Ceres can require the Trading Advisors to modify positions of the Partnership/Master Fund if Ceres believes they violate the Partnership's/Master Fund's trading policies.  Credit Risk  In addition to market risk, in entering into Futures Interests, there is a credit risk to the Partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the Partnership/Master Fund for Futures Interests traded in the U.S., and most foreign exchanges on which the Partnership/Master Fund trade, is . . .
