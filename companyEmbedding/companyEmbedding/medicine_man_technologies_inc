About Medicine Man Technologies | Cannabis Industry Consulting




















 









 


 

 
A Brief History of Medicine Man
		
  
In 2008, Pete Williams began growing  cannabis in his Colorado basement as a licensed caregiver for medical marijuana  patients. What began as a small enterprise with three 1000-watt high pressure  sodium lamps has grown into the largest single dispensary operation in  Colorado. In 2009 with the release of the Ogden Memo (a letter from the U.S.  Attorney General's office stating federal law enforcement should not focus on  an industry that is in compliance with state laws), Pete's brother Andy saw the  potential to begin a successful business venture. There was always an  entrepreneurial streak in the family, and the brothers were no exception. After  much research and many meetings, Andy and Pete's mother agreed to become their  first angel investor and Medicine Man was born. 
 
The brothers immediately saw  the need to purchase property for their business, and managed to find just the  right area in which to set up their facility. The purchase of property was an  integral part of their business plan and future success. Within this newly  emerging industry, the brothers decided to create a legally compliant,  commercially scalable business, employing industrial processes to create an  economy of scale that would allow them to offer exceptionally competitive  prices. To this day the brothers continue to invest in their business in order  to deliver the best medical and recreational cannabis to consumers within  Colorado and from across the United States. 
 
Medicine Man's continued success is  due in large part to employing quality people, maintaining ethical integrity,  and ensuring safety and compliance are held to the highest standard. For more  information on Medicine Man Denver, including their current Menu, Specials, and  Career opportunities visit them online at Medicine Man Denver.

Medicine Man Technologies Testimonials




















 









 


 

 
Client Testimonials
		
 
See what our clients are saying about us
 
"Our team just got back from our initial site visit to the Medicine Man facilities in Denver and were most impressed.  Their operations are 1st class and their attention to detail as well as insuring we had adequate information and referrals for a processing partner were extraordinary.  Their fees for application support and deployment were very reasonable compared to other consultants we interviewed and they did not require a revenue sharing or ownership interest as a part of their compensation.  We look forward to working with their team over the next few months as we prepare our application for submittal in late January." 
Dirk F., Applicant Principal, Hawaii 
 
 
 
"Our team was very impressed by the professional attention the MMT Team provided in the creation of our application.  Brett traveled multiple times to Illinois to meet with us over several months and was very responsive to email and phone calls.  Their experience and guidance was instrumental in our being able to achieve one of the first clearances for operations by the Department of Agriculture in Illinois.  Their training was 1st class and their fees reasonable noting they, unlike other consultants we considered did not have a revenue or ownership sharing requirement."
 George A., Cultivation/Production Business Owner, Illinois 
 		
 
 
"We found Medicine Man Technologies provided us with excellent deployment and training services at an affordable price.  In addition to the onsite training we received at their dispensary in Denver Colorado over multiple visits earlier this year, Pete and Nelson did a great job preparing our team here in Illinois as we prepared to open our stores.  We highly recommend them for any dispensary deployment needs."
 Hugo and Traci F., Illinois Dispensary Owners 
  
 
 
"The MMT Team has been great to work with over these past few months.  Brett and Kim have both made several trips to our offices here in Nevada in working with our architect and general contractor in the creation of our building plans.  They have provided an experience and knowledge base that, with the keen eye of our general contractor should save our group the entirety of their initial licensing fees before I even become operational.  They are very responsive to my calls and emails and I look forward to utilizing their training in Denver as well as onsite at our location as we become operational in 2016." 
Greg P., Cultivation/Processing Partner, Nevada

May 16 17
Medicine Man Technologies Inc. announced earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Total revenue for first quarter of 2017 was up by 270%, to $541,136, in comparison to revenues in first quarter 2016 of $199,615. The company attributes this increase in revenue to both consulting as well as licensing fees as new states continue to adopt new legal cannabis laws. Net income before taxes for the first quarter of 2017 was $111,163, compared to losses in the first quarter of 2016 of $113,856.

The company expects revenues to increase in the second quarter of 2017 based upon interim deposits and anticipated billings, it also notes that there are substantial contingent residual values related to application support in Pennsylvania, as well as new clients coming online in Michigan, Ohio, Arkansas, and California. Success Nutrient and Pono Publication income is a part of the consideration for the company's second quarter performance, noting projected revenues for those businesses are expected to generate revenue of at least $450,000 as it adds several new Denver based grower supply stores to its list of clients.

    WEBSITE LINKS: http://www.medicinemandenver.com/   http://www.medicinemantechnologies.com/  http://www.medicinemantechnologies.com/cultivation-operations-cannabis-technology.html  http://www.medicinemantechnologies.com/media-news.html      Medicine Man Technologies Inc. Signs Ten New Clients in October, Reaffirms Acquisitions Status, and Successfully Raises Funds for Support of Continued Growth ACCESSWIRE via CMTX - Fri Oct 21, 8:13AM CDT    DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / October 21, 2016 / Medicine Man Technologies Inc. (OTCQB:MDCL), one of the country's leading cannabis branding and consulting companies announced yesterday via an 8K filing that it has added eight new licensing clients in October including five in Pennsylvania, two in Puerto Rico, and one in Florida. It further noted the addition of two clients in California under its new Cultivation MAX services product bringing the total new clients added in October to ten. Within that 8K the Company also noted a status update on its previously announced acquisitions as well as a successful funding initiative close as described herein. Brett Roper, the Company's Co-Founder noted, "We are continuing to grow our existing client base and are very pleased to add these new groups to our existing clients in Arizona, California, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Puerto Rico." In yesterday's 8K filing the Company noted that it had previously reported execution a binding term sheet on Aug. 12, 2016, whereby we agreed to acquire Pono Publications Ltd. ("Pono") and Success Nutrients, Inc. ("SNI"), both Colorado corporations, in consideration for the issuance of an aggregate of 7 million shares of our common stock. While we continue to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement with Pono and SNI, and complete due diligence efforts, on Oct. 18, 2016, we executed an Interim Products and Services Support Agreement with both companies (the "Interim Agreement"). This Interim Agreement is intended to act as a "bridge" to allow us to work with both Pono and SNI to perpetuate our respective business plans and take advantage of our respective synergies during the time the definitive agreements are being completed. Through this agreement we will share net revenues with Pono and SNI, as applicable and expect to also benefit from the anticipated generation of new clients, and sharing of intellectual property. In yesterday's 8K filing, the Company noted that it had previously reported signing a non-binding term sheet to acquire Capital G Ltd, an Ohio limited liability company and its three wholly owned subsidiary companies, Funk Sac LLC, Commodigy LLC, and OdorNo LLC, in consideration for the issuance of an aggregate of 1.3 million shares of our common stock. We believe that this transaction remains viable; however, the due diligence efforts are taking longer than expected. While we remain optimistic that this acquisition will be successful, the successful closing of this transaction is dependent on the outcome of our due diligence. As part of the terms included in the term sheet, we have fulfilled our agreement with Capital G Ltd. To provide funding for its operations over the past several months in the form of $250,000 in convertible debt. This note is for a one-year term and accrues interest at 12% per annum. Andy Williams, the Company's CEO and Co-Founder added, "As we work to wrap up these synergistic acquisitions, we will continue to search for growth opportunities that will help expand our value proposition to our clients and partners and to add new lines of revenue through products and services that drive the evolution of the cannabis industry. We will continue to focus on building our brands warehouse to offer a more efficient delivery of marketing and corporate services. This November's election will mark the latest opportunity for the cannabis industry to expand into new states and create further opportunities for Medicine Man Technologies to help them do it." The Company further announces that it has just launched a new product branded Cultivation MAX, wherein we are providing cultivation advisory services to existing operators desiring to increase their yields through deployment of our combined efficiencies. We anticipate revenues related to this new deployment to include design fees as well as income derived by formula arising from the anticipated improvement experienced in our client's cultivation practices. While no specific assurances can be provided, we believe this future income stream may be substantial based upon current performance levels noted in the cannabis cultivation landscape within states allowing for access of such related products. The Company also announced that effective Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, we engaged in an initial closing of private offering of convertible notes in the aggregate amount of $500,000 from four accredited investors in which there we no fees or commissions required. Our anticipated use of proceeds of these funds will be related to 1) cost of consummating the acquisitions described herein; 2) hiring additional employees in anticipation of our continued growth; 3) additional marketing and industry presence advertising; and 4) working capital, including capital to be used in expanding our 'branding warehouse' approach to support growth. The Company will also continue to be a Platinum level sponsor of the industry's largest conference, to be held in Las Vegas Nevada in November and as held by Marijuana Business Daily noting information for this even that can be found at https://mjbizconference.com/. About Medicine Man Technologies Established in March 2014, the Company secured its first client/licensee in April 2014. To date, they have provided guidance for several clients (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) that have successfully secured licenses to operate cannabis businesses within their state. They currently have twenty-four active clients in 13 states, focusing on working with licensees and clients to 1) utilize its experience, technology, and training to help secure a license, 2) deploy the Company's highly effective variable capacity constant harvest cultivation practices and eliminate the liability of single grower dependence, 3) avoid the costly mistakes generally made in start-up, and 4) stay engaged with an ever expanding team of licensees all focused on quality and safety that will 'share' the ever improving experience and knowledge of the network. Safe Harbor Statement This press release may contain forward looking statements which are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions that involve risks as well as uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected, including statements related to the amount and timing of expected revenues as well as any payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock, statements related to our financial performance, expected income, distributions, and future growth for upcoming quarterly and annual periods. These risks and uncertainties are further defined in filings and reports by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Among other matters, the Company may not be able to sustain growth or achieve profitability based upon many factors including but not limited to general stock market conditions. Reference is hereby made to cautionary statements set forth in the Company's most recent SEC filings. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in our expansion of our existing as well as new service lines noting there is no assurance that we will generate enough revenues to offset those costs in both the near and long term. Additional service offerings may expose us to additional legal and regulatory costs and unknown exposure(s) based upon the various geopolitical locations we will be providing services in, the impact of which cannot be predicted at this time. Contact Information: Attention Brett Roper via info@medicinemantechnologies.com Telephone (303) 371-0387 Website www.medicinemantechnologies.com SOURCE: Medicine Man Technologies Inc. http://www.accesswire.com/img.ashx?id=447455 Copyright 2016 ACCESSWIRE     Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   (a) We previously reported that we executed a binding term sheet on Aug. 12, 2016, whereby we agreed to acquire Pono Publications Ltd. (“Pono”) and Success Nutrients, Inc. (“SNI”), both Colorado corporations, in consideration for the issuance of an aggregate of 7 million shares of our common stock. While we continue to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement with Pono and SNI, and complete due diligence efforts, on Oct. 18, 2016, we executed an Interim Products and Services Support Agreement with both companies (the “Interim Agreement”). This Interim Agreement is intended to act as a “bridge” to allow us to work with both Pono and SNI to perpetuate our respective business plans and take advantage of our synergy during the time the definitive agreements are being completed   Pono provides consulting services to the cannabis industry in Colorado and elsewhere, and includes the Three A LightTM cultivation publication. This new cultivation protocol has achieved repeated yields, verified through MetrcTM, in the 750-gram per square foot range of flowering canopy per year, and is deployable in both greenhouse and indoor cultivations.   The SNI brand provides one of the key underpinnings of the cultivation methodology and is essential to the overall Three A Light TM performance metric. With an investment of two years of research, development and intense testing, this product line was specifically formulated for the cannabis industry.   Among other things, the interim agreement allows us to:        · Leverage Pono’s disruptive cultivation technology to enhance the already successful industrial operation of Medicine Man, an affiliate company, for both current and future production;         · Engage Pono professional services and support in the deployment of their methodologies in fulfillment of our consulting agreements with our clients;         · To have planned, reasonable access to Pono’s Colorado-based Three A LightTM grow facilities tours and support of consulting services;         · Feature SNI as our recommended and exclusive nutrient line; and externally market the Pono and SNI names and product lines, subject to their final approval.      We will share net revenues with Pono and SNI, as applicable and expect to also benefit from the anticipated generation of new clients, and sharing of intellectual property.   A copy of the Interim Agreement is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.3, and is incorporated herein as if set forth.   (b) In a Form 8-K dated July 26, 2016, we reported that we had signed a non-binding term sheet to acquire Capital G Ltd, an Ohio limited liability company and its three wholly owned subsidiary companies, Funk Sac LLC, Commodigy LLC, and OdorNo LLC, in consideration for the issuance of an aggregate of 1.3 million shares of our common stock. We believe that this transaction remains viable; however, the due diligence efforts are taking longer than expected. While we remain optimistic that this acquisition will be successful, the successful closing of this transaction is dependent on the outcome of our due diligence. As part of the terms included in the term sheet, we had agreed to provide Capital G Ltd. with $250,000 in convertible debt, which we have done. This note is for a one year term and accrues interest at 12% per annum.             2             Item 8.01 Other Events   (a) As a result of our relationship with Pono and SNI referenced in Item 1.01, we have recently launched a new product branded Cultivation MAX, wherein we are providing cultivation advisory services to existing operators wanting to increase their yields through deployment of our combined efficiencies. As of the date of this report, we have generated our initial two clients for these services in California and are actively working with those teams to improve their cultivation practices. We anticipate revenues related to this new deployment to include design fees as well as income derived by formula arising from the anticipated improvement experienced in our client's cultivation practices.  This is generally based upon pounds per light or grams per square foot of canopy within the individual cultivation facility.  While no assurances can be provided, we believe this future income stream may be substantial based upon current performance levels noted in the cannabis cultivation landscape within states allowing for access of such related products.  This assumption is further based upon the improved performance metrics of 750 grams per square foot on an annualized basis as more fully described in section 1.01 above.   (b) Including the two new clients referenced in (a), above, we have generated a total of ten new clients in the month of October, 2016, alone. These new clients include three new cultivation support and two new dispensary support licensing agreements with clients in Pennsylvania, two cultivation agreements in in Puerto Rico and one new general support services agreement with a Florida-based client. This fills our available capacities in Pennsylvania when added to our existing support commitments. We expect that these agreements will generate significant new income for us through the first calendar quarter of 2017. While no assurances can be provided, we also expect new legislative initiatives in Ohio and Michigan to generate new clients, extending into the beginning of next year. In addition, we anticipate significant opportunities arising from the nine new cannabis initiatives included in state elections this November. Adoption of all, or a significant number of these initiatives, is expected to provide us with new opportunities to expand our consulting services and relationships. There are no assurances this will occur.   (c) Effective Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, we engaged in an initial closing of private offering of convertible notes in the aggregate amount of $500,000 from four accredited investors. Our anticipated use of proceeds of these funds will be related to 1) cost of consummating the acquisitions described in Item 1.01, above; 2) hiring additional employees in anticipation of our continued growth, including employees in the areas of facilities design, licensing and application support, and cultivation training; 3) additional marketing and industry advertising; 4) working capital, including capital to be used in expanding our ‘branding warehouse’ approach to support growth. These notes accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum and may be converted to stock in the discretion of the lender at a price of $1.75 per share or 90% of a five date VWAP, whichever is lower. The notes mature in December 2018.   Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits   (b) Exhibits. The following exhibits are included in this report:       No.   10.3   Description   Interim Products and Services Support Agreement with Pono and SNI                 3             SIGNATURES   Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.        MEDICINE MAN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.     (Registrant)         Dated: October 20, 2016 By: /s/ Brett Roper       Brett Roper,  			Chief Operating Officer           Medicine Man Technologies (OTCQB MDCL) is an innovative provider of consulting services related to cultivation, production, and dispensary operations nationally. Currently serving 24 clients in 13 states as well as having successfully supported license applications (cultivation and dispensary) in Illinois as well as Nevada, we are now working with clients in Maryland, Hawaii, and Alaska to support applications in their respective states. Further information about MMT can be found in our S1 and 10Q/K filings.    A Brief History of Medicine Man Technologies In late 2012, Andy Williams was introduced to Brett Roper and subsequent discussions revealed the substantial value of creating a new company that could "house" as well as deliver the substantial experience Medicine Man Denver had acquired over the past five years. In the spring of 2013, these two uniquely qualified businesspersons began work on what was then known as Version 1.0 of a licensing manual that was envisioned to include a unique "seed-to-sale" documentation of the business that could then become the underpinnings of any new business' entry into this space. As of this date we are now on Version 31 which is comprised of over 400 pages and growing.   In April of 2014, the business venture incorporated in Nevada as a 'C' Corporation under the name of Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. Since this new business is based in the advisory role space and not in the actual growing and distribution of the product, the company is currently in the process of becoming a p   ublic company as it continues to generate revenues through sales of consulting and licensing services. For more information on Medicine Man Technologies public filing process, please follow this link: Medicine Man Technologies - EDGAR Page   Team Biographies  Andy Williams   Andy Williams is the President and CEO of Medicine Man in Colorado.  He is veteran of the US Army, and served three years as a Cavalry Scout in the 3rd Infantry Division.  He went on to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo, CO. Andy has worked in a wide range of manufacturing industries as an industrial engineer, and in leadership positions.  He is a lifelong entrepreneur.  In 2009 the Ogden letter was published stating the Department of Justice would not utilize their resources to prosecute those individuals following state marijuana laws. That was the call to a new opportunity in the marijuana industry for Andy and his brother, Pete Williams. In December of 2009 they launched Medicine Man with the concept of being the Costco of marijuana. Six years later Medicine Man is now a $17 million a year corporation and has branched out to assist start up marijuana companies and grow facilities across the country with their consulting company, Medicine Man Technologies.

August 17, 2016 by Press Release Leave a Comment Press Release
DENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / August 15, 2016 / Medicine Man Technologies Inc. (MDCL), one of the country’s leading cannabis branding and consulting companies, announced today that it has agreed in principle to acquire Pono Publications Inc. and Success Nutrients Inc., each a Colorado corporation. The closing of this transaction is subject to due diligence and execution of more definitive agreements, which is expected to occur on or before November 9, 2016. The consideration to be paid by Medicine Man Technologies includes the issuance of 7 million shares of Medicine Man Technologies’ common stock and retention of key team member employment consideration.
The Pono Publications Inc. brand includes the Three A LightTM cultivation publication with a ‘Professional Grade’ version (scheduled for release by year end) being developed exclusively for both Three A LightTM and Medicine Man Technologies clients. This new cultivation protocol has already achieved yields in the 450-gram per square foot range (flowering canopy, annualized) and is deployable in both greenhouse and indoor based cultivation facilities. In addition to having a consulting client in Las Vegas, since January of this year, Pono Publications has sold in excess of 800 of the Three A LightTM manuals (currently list for $500) on both their web site (www.threealight.com) and on Amazon.com.
The Success Nutrients brand provides one of the key underpinnings of the cultivation methodology and is essential to the overall Three A LightTM performance metric. With an investment of two years of research, development and intense testing, this product line was specifically formulated for the cannabis industry. Within nine months of operations, this new start up business has already achieved strong growth, most recently generating $100,000 in sales in July (up from 1st month sales of $4,000 in December 2015). While there can be no assurances of future growth given at this time, recent inquiries suggest this company will be growing considerably in the upcoming year (www.successnutrients.com).
The combination of these two new businesses is expected to allow Medicine Man Technologies to establish a cultivation improvement offering to existing cultivation facility owners not yet able to achieve these performance levels. Adoption of this new methodology is expected to allow most business owners the ability to improve their existing cultivation performance metrics while maintaining the highest quality product.
Josh Haupt, Principal and Founder of Pono Publications and Success Nutrients stated, “After spending many years in development of both my proprietary nutrient line and cultivation methodologies, I am pleased to have found a new partnership opportunity in which I truly believe my companies will be able to grow with. The fact that Medicine Man Technologies is also a well-known presence in the cannabis industry should allow us to add substantial value back to the business as a whole while making more efficient use of our mutual resources.”
Brett Roper, MMT’s COO and Co-Founder noted, “As we continue to search for opportunities within our industry we were amazed to find such a remarkable prospect so close to home. The fact that these two ventures are so well developed and already generating cash flow as well as profits is extraordinary and we are excited to add these two new elements to our brand warehouse deployment. Additionally, Success Nutrients, in combination with Pono Publications and Three A LightTM add a whole new depth of value to the current Medicine Man Technologies cultivation deployment initiatives we are deploying nationwide for our clients.”
Andy Williams, MMT’s CEO and Co-Founder added, “Prior to touring Josh Haupt’s cultivation facilities, I had never met an industrial cultivator of cannabis that was better than Medicine Man. Now I have. I believe Josh Haupt and Three A LightTM are hands down the best industrial cultivators of cannabis in the world. I could not be more excited to welcome Pono Publications and Success Nutrients to Medicine Man Technologies. The revenue and earnings potential of both products are tremendous. Paired with the leadership and charisma that Josh Haupt will bring to our executive management team and the synergies of our current product and service portfolio, the potential growth on all product and service fronts is exciting.”

Reference is hereby made to cautionary statements set forth in the company’s most recent SEC filings. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in our expansion of our existing and new service lines, noting there is no assurance that we will generate enough revenues to offset those costs in both the near and long term. Additional service offerings may expose us to additional legal and regulatory costs and unknown exposure(s) based upon the various geopolitical locations where we will be providing services, the impact of which cannot be predicted at this time.

DENVER, Feb. 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Just weeks after forming their new business venture, Medicine Man Technologies; Andy Williams, President of Medicine Man Denver and Brett Roper, Chief Operating Officer of ChineseInvestors.COM (OTCQB Symbol 'CIIX') are pleased to announce their first licensee client, McGraw Holdings, LLC of Illinois.
After extensive deliberation and consultation, McGraw Holdings, LLC, has chosen Medicine Man Technologies as its key service provider in bringing their extensive industry expertise and innovative business practices to the State of Illinois.  Expectations are that this new partnership will provide Illinois medical marijuana patients with the highest quality cannabis based products the market will have to offer.  The newly formed company will be submitting applications to allow construction of two technologically advanced marijuana grow operations, to be located in Illinois State Police Districts 5 and 21 in anticipation of fulfilling the supply needs of any of the potential 60 Illinois based dispensaries as proposed.  
Mr. Tim McGraw, owner of McGraw Holdings and managing partner of this new enterprise noted, "After touring dozens of facilities and interviewing their respective management teams, Medicine Man Technologies was our clear choice.  Mr. Andy Williams, his team, his experience, and extraordinary facilities are second to none in the industry.  In our opinion, we could not be more excited about building our new enterprise using his wealth of experience and success in Colorado to provide a steady supply of the highest quality medicine to patients in Illinois."
Mr. Andy Williams, Medicine Man's President and General Director of Medicine Man Technologies commented, "We are excited by this first of many opportunities to deliver our experience and highly evolved, variable capacity, continuous harvest process to this explosive growth-oriented space nationally.  We were also impressed with Tim's general business experience and the quality of his partners in this new business.  His construction as well as project management background add excellent value underpinnings as well."
Medicine Man Denver is in the process of substantially expanding their current facilities and was one of the first businesses in Colorado to be granted a recreational use license by the City and County of Denver and the State of Colorado.  Their substantial investment in both their business and community creates both an expanded tax base as well as a growing source of employment.  More information about Medicine Man Denver can be found at www.medicinemandenver.com. 
ChineseInvestors.COM, Inc. ('CIIX'), founded in 1999, endeavors to be an innovative company providing (a) real-time market commentary, analysis, and educational related services in Chinese language character sets (traditional and simplified), (b) support services to our various partners, (c) consultative services to smaller private companies considering becoming a public company, (d) advertising and public relation related support services, and (e) other services we may identify having the potential to create value or partnership opportunity with our existing skills and services.  For further information email us at info@chinesefn.com or visit our website at www.chinesefn.com.

About Medicine Man Technologies | Cannabis Industry Consulting




















 









 


 

 
A Brief History of Medicine Man
		
  
In 2008, Pete Williams began growing  cannabis in his Colorado basement as a licensed caregiver for medical marijuana  patients. What began as a small enterprise with three 1000-watt high pressure  sodium lamps has grown into the largest single dispensary operation in  Colorado. In 2009 with the release of the Ogden Memo (a letter from the U.S.  Attorney General's office stating federal law enforcement should not focus on  an industry that is in compliance with state laws), Pete's brother Andy saw the  potential to begin a successful business venture. There was always an  entrepreneurial streak in the family, and the brothers were no exception. After  much research and many meetings, Andy and Pete's mother agreed to become their  first angel investor and Medicine Man was born. 
 
The brothers immediately saw  the need to purchase property for their business, and managed to find just the  right area in which to set up their facility. The purchase of property was an  integral part of their business plan and future success. Within this newly  emerging industry, the brothers decided to create a legally compliant,  commercially scalable business, employing industrial processes to create an  economy of scale that would allow them to offer exceptionally competitive  prices. To this day the brothers continue to invest in their business in order  to deliver the best medical and recreational cannabis to consumers within  Colorado and from across the United States. 
 
Medicine Man's continued success is  due in large part to employing quality people, maintaining ethical integrity,  and ensuring safety and compliance are held to the highest standard. For more  information on Medicine Man Denver, including their current Menu, Specials, and  Career opportunities visit them online at Medicine Man Denver.
