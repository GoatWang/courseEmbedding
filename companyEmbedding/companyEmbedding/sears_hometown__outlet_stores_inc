History[edit]
Sears Holdings spun off Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in 2012 to attempt to restore profitability and raise shareholder confidence.[6] Sears Holdings spun off more than 1,100 Hometown and 122 outlet stores.[7] Hometown stores are small hardware and appliance stores operated by independent retailers.[7] Outlet stores sell Sears merchandise at discount.[7] Outlet stores are approximately 18,000 square feet and equipped with items such as home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods and tools.[1] Outlet stores sell discontinued, used, cosmetically blemished or reconditioned merchandise with new parts.[1][8]
Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores partnered with the National Volunteer Fire Council in November 2013 to raise money for local fire departments.[9] The objective of the campaign was to provide firehouses with funds to improve resources for training, equipment, and financial support.[9]
Operations[edit]
As of January 28, 2017, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,020 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.[10] Sears Hometown and Sears Outlet consisted of 944 Sears Hometown stores, 96 hardware stores, 76 home appliance showrooms and 143 Outlet stores in October 2012.[10][11]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Sears Hometown Store[edit]
Sears Hometown stores are independently owned stores that sell Sears merchandise.[12] In 2013, 70-80% of Hometown stores were independently owned.[12] Formerly Sears Dealer Stores, they are a chain of smaller stores that operate as a store where the proprietor owns or leases the real estate while Sears Holdings handles the marketing and owns the inventory, and there are no franchising fees levied against the store proprietor. These stores are usually located in smaller markets that do not support full-sized Sears. They are signed as Sears and are usually free-standing or located in strip malls. They primarily concentrate on hardware, appliances and lawn-and-garden supplies. Most of Hometown Stores carry Sears brand products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently owned and averaging 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve customers within their local communities.
Sears Outlet Store[edit]




A Sears Outlet store near Portland, Oregon, in 2017


An outlet version of Sears department stores located in various retail locations across the U.S., as well as online. The stores sell appliances, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods, tools, and lawn and garden equipment. Sears Outlet provide with in-store and online access to new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratch-and-dented merchandise at a discounted price (at twenty to sixty percent off regular retail price) [13][14] Each store, on average, is larger than 18,000 square feet in size.[15]
In 1968, Sears opened a surplus store in Kansas City. In 1994, the surplus stores were renamed to Sears Outlet.[16] In 1995, Sears Outlet restructured in order to manage repairs and product distribution from a centralized location. To do this, they established a series of facilities known as Outlet Repair and Distribution Centers. In 2015, there were 22 of these centers in operation. In 2008, apparel was introduced to Sears Outlet stores and served as a liquidation outlet for Lands' End. In 2009, SearsOutlet.com was launched as an e-commerce platform allowing customers to purchase items online and in 2011, nationwide delivery was offered.[citation needed]
In 2012, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores was spun off from Sears Holdings.[17][18] At the time of the separation, there were 122 Sears Outlet Stores in operation.[19][20] As of February 1, 2014, Sears Outlet stores have expanded its operations to 143 locations.[21] The majority of Sears Outlet stores are company-operated (115) and 28 Sears Outlet stores are locally owned and operated by franchisees.[22] Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores initiated a program to franchise Sears Outlet stores in 2012. In 2013, home appliances made up 78% of Sears Outlet's sales revenue and total revenue from Sears Outlet stores was $610 million.[22] In 2014, Sears Outlet partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to support children with life-threatening conditions.[23]
Sears Home Appliance Showroom[edit]

Sears Appliance and Hardware Store[edit]
Sears appliance and hardware stores are hardware stores that carry the entire line of Sears hardware and appliances. As of April 2012, 96 stores were in operation.[10] Hardware Stores, averaging nearly 28,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban markets and are neighborhood stores designed to conveniently serve local customers.

History[edit]
Sears Holdings spun off Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in 2012 to attempt to restore profitability and raise shareholder confidence.[6] Sears Holdings spun off more than 1,100 Hometown and 122 outlet stores.[7] Hometown stores are small hardware and appliance stores operated by independent retailers.[7] Outlet stores sell Sears merchandise at discount.[7] Outlet stores are approximately 18,000 square feet and equipped with items such as home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods and tools.[1] Outlet stores sell discontinued, used, cosmetically blemished or reconditioned merchandise with new parts.[1][8]
Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores partnered with the National Volunteer Fire Council in November 2013 to raise money for local fire departments.[9] The objective of the campaign was to provide firehouses with funds to improve resources for training, equipment, and financial support.[9]
Operations[edit]
As of January 28, 2017, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,020 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.[10] Sears Hometown and Sears Outlet consisted of 944 Sears Hometown stores, 96 hardware stores, 76 home appliance showrooms and 143 Outlet stores in October 2012.[10][11]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Sears Hometown Store[edit]
Sears Hometown stores are independently owned stores that sell Sears merchandise.[12] In 2013, 70-80% of Hometown stores were independently owned.[12] Formerly Sears Dealer Stores, they are a chain of smaller stores that operate as a store where the proprietor owns or leases the real estate while Sears Holdings handles the marketing and owns the inventory, and there are no franchising fees levied against the store proprietor. These stores are usually located in smaller markets that do not support full-sized Sears. They are signed as Sears and are usually free-standing or located in strip malls. They primarily concentrate on hardware, appliances and lawn-and-garden supplies. Most of Hometown Stores carry Sears brand products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently owned and averaging 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve customers within their local communities.
Sears Outlet Store[edit]




A Sears Outlet store near Portland, Oregon, in 2017


An outlet version of Sears department stores located in various retail locations across the U.S., as well as online. The stores sell appliances, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods, tools, and lawn and garden equipment. Sears Outlet provide with in-store and online access to new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratch-and-dented merchandise at a discounted price (at twenty to sixty percent off regular retail price) [13][14] Each store, on average, is larger than 18,000 square feet in size.[15]
In 1968, Sears opened a surplus store in Kansas City. In 1994, the surplus stores were renamed to Sears Outlet.[16] In 1995, Sears Outlet restructured in order to manage repairs and product distribution from a centralized location. To do this, they established a series of facilities known as Outlet Repair and Distribution Centers. In 2015, there were 22 of these centers in operation. In 2008, apparel was introduced to Sears Outlet stores and served as a liquidation outlet for Lands' End. In 2009, SearsOutlet.com was launched as an e-commerce platform allowing customers to purchase items online and in 2011, nationwide delivery was offered.[citation needed]
In 2012, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores was spun off from Sears Holdings.[17][18] At the time of the separation, there were 122 Sears Outlet Stores in operation.[19][20] As of February 1, 2014, Sears Outlet stores have expanded its operations to 143 locations.[21] The majority of Sears Outlet stores are company-operated (115) and 28 Sears Outlet stores are locally owned and operated by franchisees.[22] Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores initiated a program to franchise Sears Outlet stores in 2012. In 2013, home appliances made up 78% of Sears Outlet's sales revenue and total revenue from Sears Outlet stores was $610 million.[22] In 2014, Sears Outlet partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to support children with life-threatening conditions.[23]
Sears Home Appliance Showroom[edit]
Home appliance showrooms display merchandise in-stores. The stores have an internet kiosk where customers are able to view similar products, price match, and order products not available in the store. Averaging 5,000 square feet with a primarily appliance showroom design [24][25]
Sears Appliance and Hardware Store[edit]
Sears appliance and hardware stores are hardware stores that carry the entire line of Sears hardware and appliances. As of April 2012, 96 stores were in operation.[10] Hardware Stores, averaging nearly 28,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban markets and are neighborhood stores designed to conveniently serve local customers.
Awards[edit]

History[edit]
Sears Holdings spun off Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in 2012 to attempt to restore profitability and raise shareholder confidence.[6] Sears Holdings spun off more than 1,100 Hometown and 122 outlet stores.[7] Hometown stores are small hardware and appliance stores operated by independent retailers.[7] Outlet stores sell Sears merchandise at discount.[7] Outlet stores are approximately 18,000 square feet and equipped with items such as home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods and tools.[1] Outlet stores sell discontinued, used, cosmetically blemished or reconditioned merchandise with new parts.[1][8]
Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores partnered with the National Volunteer Fire Council in November 2013 to raise money for local fire departments.[9] The objective of the campaign was to provide firehouses with funds to improve resources for training, equipment, and financial support.[9]
Operations[edit]
As of January 28, 2017, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,020 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.[10] Sears Hometown and Sears Outlet consisted of 944 Sears Hometown stores, 96 hardware stores, 76 home appliance showrooms and 143 Outlet stores in October 2012.[10][11]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Sears Hometown Store[edit]
Sears Hometown stores are independently owned stores that sell Sears merchandise.[12] In 2013, 70-80% of Hometown stores were independently owned.[12] Formerly Sears Dealer Stores, they are a chain of smaller stores that operate as a store where the proprietor owns or leases the real estate while Sears Holdings handles the marketing and owns the inventory, and there are no franchising fees levied against the store proprietor. These stores are usually located in smaller markets that do not support full-sized Sears. They are signed as Sears and are usually free-standing or located in strip malls. They primarily concentrate on hardware, appliances and lawn-and-garden supplies. Most of Hometown Stores carry Sears brand products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently owned and averaging 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve customers within their local communities.
Sears Outlet Store[edit]




A Sears Outlet store near Portland, Oregon, in 2017


An outlet version of Sears department stores located in various retail locations across the U.S., as well as online. The stores sell appliances, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods, tools, and lawn and garden equipment. Sears Outlet provide with in-store and online access to new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratch-and-dented merchandise at a discounted price (at twenty to sixty percent off regular retail price) [13][14] Each store, on average, is larger than 18,000 square feet in size.[15]
In 1968, Sears opened a surplus store in Kansas City. In 1994, the surplus stores were renamed to Sears Outlet.[16] In 1995, Sears Outlet restructured in order to manage repairs and product distribution from a centralized location. To do this, they established a series of facilities known as Outlet Repair and Distribution Centers. In 2015, there were 22 of these centers in operation. In 2008, apparel was introduced to Sears Outlet stores and served as a liquidation outlet for Lands' End. In 2009, SearsOutlet.com was launched as an e-commerce platform allowing customers to purchase items online and in 2011, nationwide delivery was offered.[citation needed]
In 2012, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores was spun off from Sears Holdings.[17][18] At the time of the separation, there were 122 Sears Outlet Stores in operation.[19][20] As of February 1, 2014, Sears Outlet stores have expanded its operations to 143 locations.[21] The majority of Sears Outlet stores are company-operated (115) and 28 Sears Outlet stores are locally owned and operated by franchisees.[22] Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores initiated a program to franchise Sears Outlet stores in 2012. In 2013, home appliances made up 78% of Sears Outlet's sales revenue and total revenue from Sears Outlet stores was $610 million.[22] In 2014, Sears Outlet partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to support children with life-threatening conditions.[23]
Sears Home Appliance Showroom[edit]
Home appliance showrooms display merchandise in-stores. The stores have an internet kiosk where customers are able to view similar products, price match, and order products not available in the store. Averaging 5,000 square feet with a primarily appliance showroom design [24][25]
Sears Appliance and Hardware Store[edit]
Sears appliance and hardware stores are hardware stores that carry the entire line of Sears hardware and appliances. As of April 2012, 96 stores were in operation.[10] Hardware Stores, averaging nearly 28,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban markets and are neighborhood stores designed to conveniently serve local customers.
Awards[edit]
Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores received the Customer Engagement award from the online publication Retail TouchPoints for their interactive in-store campaign.[26]

History[edit]
Sears Holdings spun off Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in 2012 to attempt to restore profitability and raise shareholder confidence.[6] Sears Holdings spun off more than 1,100 Hometown and 122 outlet stores.[7] Hometown stores are small hardware and appliance stores operated by independent retailers.[7] Outlet stores sell Sears merchandise at discount.[7] Outlet stores are approximately 18,000 square feet and equipped with items such as home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods and tools.[1] Outlet stores sell discontinued, used, cosmetically blemished or reconditioned merchandise with new parts.[1][8]
Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores partnered with the National Volunteer Fire Council in November 2013 to raise money for local fire departments.[9] The objective of the campaign was to provide firehouses with funds to improve resources for training, equipment, and financial support.[9]
Operations[edit]
As of January 28, 2017, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,020 stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.[10] Sears Hometown and Sears Outlet consisted of 944 Sears Hometown stores, 96 hardware stores, 76 home appliance showrooms and 143 Outlet stores in October 2012.[10][11]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Sears Hometown Store[edit]
Sears Hometown stores are independently owned stores that sell Sears merchandise.[12] In 2013, 70-80% of Hometown stores were independently owned.[12] Formerly Sears Dealer Stores, they are a chain of smaller stores that operate as a store where the proprietor owns or leases the real estate while Sears Holdings handles the marketing and owns the inventory, and there are no franchising fees levied against the store proprietor. These stores are usually located in smaller markets that do not support full-sized Sears. They are signed as Sears and are usually free-standing or located in strip malls. They primarily concentrate on hardware, appliances and lawn-and-garden supplies. Most of Hometown Stores carry Sears brand products, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard, as well as a wide assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently owned and averaging 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve customers within their local communities.
Sears Outlet Store[edit]




A Sears Outlet store near Portland, Oregon, in 2017


An outlet version of Sears department stores located in various retail locations across the U.S., as well as online. The stores sell appliances, apparel, mattresses, sporting goods, tools, and lawn and garden equipment. Sears Outlet provide with in-store and online access to new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratch-and-dented merchandise at a discounted price (at twenty to sixty percent off regular retail price) [13][14] Each store, on average, is larger than 18,000 square feet in size.[15]
In 1968, Sears opened a surplus store in Kansas City. In 1994, the surplus stores were renamed to Sears Outlet.[16] In 1995, Sears Outlet restructured in order to manage repairs and product distribution from a centralized location. To do this, they established a series of facilities known as Outlet Repair and Distribution Centers. In 2015, there were 22 of these centers in operation. In 2008, apparel was introduced to Sears Outlet stores and served as a liquidation outlet for Lands' End. In 2009, SearsOutlet.com was launched as an e-commerce platform allowing customers to purchase items online and in 2011, nationwide delivery was offered.[citation needed]
In 2012, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores was spun off from Sears Holdings.[17][18] At the time of the separation, there were 122 Sears Outlet Stores in operation.[19][20] As of February 1, 2014, Sears Outlet stores have expanded its operations to 143 locations.[21] The majority of Sears Outlet stores are company-operated (115) and 28 Sears Outlet stores are locally owned and operated by franchisees.[22] Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores initiated a program to franchise Sears Outlet stores in 2012. In 2013, home appliances made up 78% of Sears Outlet's sales revenue and total revenue from Sears Outlet stores was $610 million.[22] In 2014, Sears Outlet partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to support children with life-threatening conditions.[23]

As of April 2012, 96 stores were in operation.[10] Hardware Stores, averaging nearly 28,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban markets and are neighborhood stores designed to conveniently serve local customers.

Highway 372, Suite 4, on July 12, 2017. The Pahrump store is one of hundreds across the nation to be rebranded and welcome an extended product line.By Jeffrey MeehanPahrump Valley TimesThe Sears Hometown Store in Pahrump is one of hundreds of locations across the country that has gone through a rebranding—bringing in additional products and technology upgrades that increase access to a wider variety of merchandise.“With the integration of technology into our shopping experience, we’re able to offer a greatly improved shopping experience,” said Lennie Hill, a district manager of the Sears Hometown Stores in Nevada, in a written statement. “Customers will be able to search and compare any combination of appliances they can think of through our in-store kiosks…”As part of the refresh, the local store at 1360 E. Highway 372, Suite 4, added “more brands and an improved presentation,” Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores Inc. (SHOS), said in a news release. Nationwide, Sears Hometown is also changing its branding to America’s Appliance Experts.“The stores’ appliances are also focused on innovative and value-added products from LG Electronics Inc., General Electric Co., Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Samsung Electronics Co. and Kenmore,” according to the company.Sears Hometown also provided employees with comprehensive training, which included “brand-specific selling certification,” the company announced in a news release.Corporate refresh and structureThe new look in Pahrump was announced by Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in June, along with another location in Fallon. Overall, the company has updated more than 635 locations, or more than 60 percent of its portfolio, as of a June 7 news release. The companywide initiative began in 2015.The upgrade data includes corporate locations, along with independent franchise stores, with the Pahrump location being one of those.Generally, franchise owners are responsible for operating costs such as rent and payroll but not its inventory, according to information on the Sears Hometown corporate website.Sears Hometown provides the merchandise for the store’s operator, which averages $200,000 to $300,000, along with supplying marketing efforts. Franchisees are then paid a commission for sales, along with collecting revenue from protection agreements, credit offerings and delivery and installation services.Franchise owners must have a minimum of $20,000 cash and a positive net worth of at least $100,000 to open a new store. Options for adding a Sears Hometown label to an existing business, which already has a physical location, are also available.Sears Hometown store closingsSears Hometown, which spun off in 2012 from Sears Holdings Corp., owner of Sears department stores, has traveled down a similar path with store closure announcements becoming a regular occurrence.Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores operated 1,012 stores, across 50 states and Puerto Rico and Bermuda, as of April 29. That number includes holdings by independent dealers and franchisees as well, according to a news release from Sears Hometown corporate.That’s down from the 1,245 locations the company held in early 2013, nearly a 19 percent decrease, information from a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in February 2013 showed.A large portion of store closings occurred in the company’s 2016 fiscal year. Based on a net loss of 140 locations, about 66 percent of the company’s closures occurred during fiscal year 2016, which ended in January. The company shuttered 160 locations in that period—though 20 new stores came online as well.Not all the information is negative.Positive rifts occurred during the first quarter for Sears Hometown stores that had gone through a rebranding to the America’s Appliance Experts.According to a first quarter earnings report, statistics showed sales on appliances with the new branding were 408 basis points above stores that hadn’t converted, which is equal to about 4 percent more sales.In May, Sears Hometown decided that it would close more stores, to better use its capital and reduce costs, the company said. The company, which operates two separate labels, Sears Hometown and its Outlet Stores label, planned to shutter 22 stores (10 Hometown and 12 Outlet locations).Sears Hometown also made plans to purchase back 14 franchise locations in the first quarter, and the company could make plans for this type of deal in the future.“We view reacquisitions of franchisee-operated stores that are not meeting our performance expectations as an important part of our long-term strategy,” the company stated in an earnings report at the end of April.State of retail across the nationSears Holdings, owner of Sears and Kmart stores, has closed many of its stores since 2012 as well. The iconic brand that once did business through catalog orders has gone from 867 full-line Sears locations to 626 at the end of the first quarter.The company also plans to close more than 70 Sears stores by the end of 2017.Some of its other holdings have also been reduced in size, with Kmart sitting at 624 locations at the end of the first quarter. That’s a decrease of more than 50 percent in locations since 2012, when there were more than 1,300 Kmart stores in operation.This is not an unusual tale in today’s market, as retailers have announced closure of thousands of stores in 2017 alone. According to Fung Global Retail &Technology, the U.S. should expect more than 9,400 retail locations to close in 2017.Names such as Payless Shoes and Rue21 Inc. announced entry into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017. Just those two retailers alone account for more than 1,000 store closings.Other labels closing locations include Guess Inc., Bebe Stores Inc. and Abercrombie &Fitch.Contact reporter Jeffrey Meehan at jmeehan@pvtimes.com.

ANDERSON, Ind., June  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evolving to meet changing consumer needs and to embrace its nationwide branding as “America’s Appliance Experts®,” the refresh of two Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in Indiana culminates with a grand reopening celebration June 16-17, 2017 at the locations in Anderson and Columbia City. Throughout the celebration weekend, consumers are invited to enjoy an additional discount of 10 percent off almost everything in the store.*The store refresh includes a new product assortment, redesigned merchandising, new fixtures & signage, and comprehensive employee training, among other changes.“After all the hard work and dedication of our sales associates across our Indiana locations, we’re excited to celebrate with the community,” said Chris George, a district manager of Sears Hometown Stores in Indiana. “We are sure that shoppers will appreciate the new in-store experience and the introduction of touch screen kiosks to assist with the decision-making process. The one thing that hasn’t changed is our commitment to providing the top name brand appliances at great low prices.”In the new store design, appliances occupy more than half of the sales floor and include more brands with an improved presentation. The stores’ appliances are also focused on innovative and value-added products from LG®, GE®, Whirlpool®, Maytag®, KitchenAid®, Samsung® and Kenmore®.The new floor plan also includes the ability to showcase complete kitchen packages through the addition of three kitchen vignettes. This allows stores to display an entire four-piece kitchen from multiple brands in a small amount of floor space, making it easier for customers to choose products. Another new feature that simplifies the buying process is a designated laundry innovation area, showcasing multiple brands and innovations that lets customers easily explore the differences between the various product lines.As part of the refresh, the Indiana Sears Hometown Stores provide industry leading comprehensive training to store associates, including brand specific selling certification. These brand certified sales associates help ensure customers find the best product for their needs at the best possible price. Indiana customers also benefit from a new touch-screen kiosk where they can work with a salesperson or browse on their own to explore product options or make purchases. With the touch-screen kiosk, associates and customers can review product features and benefits as well as various models from the entire online database of Sears products – all while browsing models around the sales floor. Among major retailers, the Indiana Sears Hometown Stores are leading the way for the integration of touch-screen devices into the sales process.The Indiana locations are part of a system-wide refresh of all Sears Hometown Store locations. The Company began updating units in 2015 and now has more than 635 “America’s Appliance Experts” locations across the United States.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
