Charles de Vaulx is a French-born asset manager. He is currently chief investment officer, co-portfolio manager, and partner at International Value Advisers, LLC.
Background and history[edit]
He earned a Master in Finance from Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Rouen, France. In January 1987, de Vaulx joined the SoGen Funds, working under Jean-Marie Eveillard as an analyst. In August 1996, de Vaulx became an associate portfolio manager. In 1999, Société Générale sold the SoGen Funds to Arnold and S. Bleichroeder Advisers and the funds were renamed First Eagle Funds. In January 2000, de Vaulx was made co-portfolio manager of four funds and a number of institutional accounts. In December 2001 he and his colleague Jean-Marie Eveillard were awarded Morningstar's "International Stock Manager of the Year." De Vaulx was designated as the hand-picked successor to Eveillard who went on to retire in December 2004, making de Vaulx the lead portfolio manager in January 2005. Surprising the industry, de Vaulx left First Eagle,[1] just weeks after winning another Morningstar award in December 2006 as the runner-up for "International Stock Manager of the Year." In 2008, de Vaulx joined International Value Advisers, and currently serves as chief investment officer, co-portfolio manager, and partner.

Astellas Pharma Recommended By Charles De Vaulx Of IVA Funds - Astellas Pharma, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ALPMF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Astellas Pharma Recommended By Charles De Vaulx Of IVA FundsFeb. 2.17 | About: Astellas Pharma, (ALPMF) Holmes Osborne Value, bonds, CFA, registered investment advisorOsborne Global InvestmentsSummaryAstellas has been increasing sales for years.The stock is under followed in the U.S.Astellas is a major holding of IVA Funds.Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF)(OTCPK:ALPMY) is a Japanese drug maker and a major holding of IVA Funds. The stock is reasonably priced and has been growing sales for several years. Charles de Vaulx recently recommended the stock on Wealthtrack. The company has 2.01 billion shares, the stock trades for ¥1,465, and the market cap is ¥3 trillion ($25.8 billion). It takes 114 yen to buy one dollar. The dividend is ¥33 and the dividend yield is 2.3%. Earnings per ¥96.36 and the price to earnings ratio is 15.2. Over the last three fiscal years ending in March, revenues were ¥1.14 trillion ($10 billion) in 2014, ¥1.25 trillion ($11 billion) in 2015, and ¥1.372 trillion ($12 billion) in 2016. Thus far Astellas looks like a text book stock-trades at a reasonable price and sales increase every year. Net income went from ¥91 billion ($800 million) to ¥194 billion ($1.7 billion) over that time frame. The balance sheet shows ¥378 billion ($3.3 billion) in cash and ¥322 billion ($2.8 billion) in receivables. The liability side shows ¥154 billion ($1.35 billion) in payables and ¥70 billion ($614 million) in debt. Bullet proof. Free cash flow was ¥196 billion ($1.7 billion) in 2016. That would be a free cash flow yield of 6.2%. Return on equity was 15% last year. For the first nine months of 2017, sales decreased 5.6% because of currencies. On a constant currency basis, they appreciated 3%. The company has been buying back stock and just authorized a ¥50 billion ($439 million) buyback. According to the Annual Report, 36.2% of sales are derived in Japan, 33.2% the Americas, 24% Europe/Middle East/Africa, and 6.6% Asia. Astellas's biggest seller is XTANDI, used for prostate cancer treatment. It can be taken orally. Eligard and Gonax are also used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Betanis/Myrbrtiq/BETMIGA are all used for urinary incontinence. There are dozens of drugs focusing on oncology, immunology, and urology in development.
 What got me interested in Astellas was an interview on Wealthtrack with Charles de Vaulx of IVA Funds (IVIQX, IVWIX). Astellas was his one recommendation. He noted that Astellas is one of IVA's largest holdings, that it has tripled in value in five years, and that he thinks the stock is as cheap as ever. de Vaulx noted that management does a good job buying back shares at the right price and that it holds net cash. The stock is on sale because it is under followed. Like most pharmaceutical companies, Astellas has drugs that will fall off patent. XTANDI falls off patent in 2019. The company has been using its cash to buy other drugs and partner with biotechs and other pharmas. So is the stock a buy? Let me tell you what I like about Astellas. The stock is reasonably priced, has lots of cash, and has been increasing sales. If it were based in the U.S., it would trade at a higher level. You can tell that management wants to make the stock look appealing. The Annual Report is 158 pages. Most Japanese Annual Reports are about 25 pages. They give as little information as possible. Not Astellas. It wants to compete with the Europeans and U.S. Unlike other Japanese companies, I don't see strange crossholdings with other companies nor a founding family that wants to operate in seclusion. My guess is that the stock is down in part over worries about our new President and what he's going to do with healthcare. As for the pipeline, pharma is not my strong suit so I'm not going to discuss clinical trials. I find the stock to be quite interesting.

   Stock Analysis  Why Does This 17.8 Billion Dollar Fund Love This Energy Stock?    Published on September 21, 2012 at 1:24 pm by  
                                Meena Krishnamsetty
                                  in Stock Analysis                 International Value Advisers, managed by Charles De Vaulx, is a New York-based fund with an estimated $17.8 billion in assets under management. The majority of International Value’s capital lies in its Diversified Global Strategy fund, which prides itself on a “flexible, go anywhere approach” to investing. Since its inception in 2008, the Diversified Global Strategy fund has achieved a 6.6% gross return per annum, with fees ranging between 0.9 to 1.5 percentage points. In addition to its adaptable strategy, De Vaulx has a penchant for the value-based teachings of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, and places a special importance on cash flow valuation. Without further ado, here is the hedge fund manager’s top stock pick, as of his second quarter 13F filing with the SEC.  Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) : Accounting for 6.2% of De Vaulx’s 13F portfolio, Devon Energy Corporation has been a decent investment this summer, returning 5.4% over the past three months. Between the first and second quarter, De Vaulx’s fund increased its ownership of Devon Energy by an estimated 6%, and its total holdings in the natural gas producer are now worth more than $312 million. International Value’s position in Devon Energy is the largest among the 400 funds we are tracking, with no other fund holding more than $275 million worth of the stock. Famed investors Jim Simons and Steven Cohen are also bullish, holding roughly $120 million in Devon Energy shares between them. Devon Energy currently trades at a Price-to-Cash Flow multiple (3.5X) below its industry’s average (5.9X) and its own 5-year historical average (5.7X). This valuation is also below many of the company’s competitors including: Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) at 96.7X, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) at 13.0X, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK) at 12.8X, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) at 109.4X, and EnCana Corporation (NYSE:ECA) at 8.8X. In fact, over the past half-decade, Devon Energy’s cash hoard has traditionally traded at a 37% discount relative to the S&P 500. This year, though, it is trading at a much cheaper 62% discount. Delving a bit deeper into Devon’s cash flows, it appears that this undervaluation is not warranted, as the energy company has grown its operating cash flow by an average rate of 7.9% a year since the recession. This 3-year average growth rate is better than many of the company’s peers, most notably Anadarko Petroleum (-5.3%), Chesapeake Energy (3.7%), and EnCana (-17.9%). When this growth is factored into our valuation calculations, we can see that Devon Energy sports a PCFG ratio – which is similar to the PEG – of 0.44; typically any figure below 1.0 signals undervaluation. Moreover, Devon’s PCFG is trading at a discount to many of its peers who are cash flow growth positive, including: Apache (2.11), Chesapeake Energy (3.46), and EOG Resources (7.74). Finally, Devon Energy also provides investors with a solid dividend yield of 1.3%, and a supportable payout ratio of 12.4%. This yield is above the likes of Apache (0.8%), Anadarko (0.5%), EOG Resources (0.6%), while trailing only Chesapeake Energy and EnCana, which have dividend yields of 1.8% and 3.6%, respectively. As mentioned above, Charles De Vaulx loves this stock, and is Devon Energy’s biggest bull in the hedge fund industry. Due to the company’s reasonable cash flow valuation and attractive growth history, it’s easy to understand why. It may be smart for individual investors to consider Devon in their portfolios, as it usually is a good idea to mimic the world’s most successful money managers.

Charles de Vaulx is a French-born asset manager. He is currently chief investment officer, co-portfolio manager, and partner at International Value Advisers, LLC.
Background and history[edit]
He earned a Master in Finance from Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Rouen, France. In January 1987, de Vaulx joined the SoGen Funds, working under Jean-Marie Eveillard as an analyst. In August 1996, de Vaulx became an associate portfolio manager. In 1999, Société Générale sold the SoGen Funds to Arnold and S. Bleichroeder Advisers and the funds were renamed First Eagle Funds. In January 2000, de Vaulx was made co-portfolio manager of four funds and a number of institutional accounts. In December 2001 he and his colleague Jean-Marie Eveillard were awarded Morningstar's "International Stock Manager of the Year." De Vaulx was designated as the hand-picked successor to Eveillard who went on to retire in December 2004, making de Vaulx the lead portfolio manager in January 2005. Surprising the industry, de Vaulx left First Eagle,[1] just weeks after winning another Morningstar award in December 2006 as the runner-up for "International Stock Manager of the Year." In 2008, de Vaulx joined International Value Advisers, and currently serves as chief investment officer, co-portfolio manager, and partner.

CHARLES DE VAULX

Chief Investment Officer,
International Value Advisers, LLC





Ask investors how they define value and you will probably get a variety of answers, an “eclectic” assortment, as this week’s guest, long-time value investor Charles de Vaulx put it.
Investment styles go in and out of favor. An extreme example was during the tech boom when growth was hot. Investors were willing to pay up if a company had a dot com in its name, and revenues were increasing. Traditional value metrics such as price and earnings didn’t seem to matter, until of course they did. Growth crashed and value took the lead in the 2000s.
In the slow growth years after the financial crisis, growth made a strong comeback and value lagged badly. Last year it flipped again. For the first time in four years, value outperformed growth.
Until then, self-described value managers have had a tough time beating the overall market and even their benchmark indexes like the Russell 2000 value index, which are chock full of many lower quality companies that are cheap for good reasons: in many cases they are highly leveraged, have no earnings or have problems.
This week’s guest is a self-described value manager with a precise definition of what value means to him and his firm. He is Charles de Vaulx, the chief investment officer and co-portfolio manager of International Value Advisers, a long only, global money management firm he co-founded with Charles de Lardemelle in 2008, at the beginning of the financial crisis.
Before founding IVA, both spent many years working with legendary value investor and frequent WEALTHTRACK guest, Jean-Marie Eveillard. They manage several portfolios but their major holdings are in two mutual funds, their flagship IVA Worldwide Fund and the IVA International Fund. Both were closed to new investors in 2011 because they didn’t want them to get too big, and felt there were too few opportunities in the market, a view they hold today.
IVA Worldwide has outperformed its Morningstar peer group and market benchmark, with less than market risk since inception. It has trailed the market in recent years however, a fact that does not bother this investor whose goal is absolute returns overall with capital preservation in the short term and market outperformance over a full economic cycle. According to de Vaulx, we are not there yet. In the meantime he is holding nearly 40% of his portfolios in cash!
In this week’s EXTRA feature on our website de Vaulx discusses the severe disruption he is seeing in many industries and how they are handling it at IVA.

Have a great weekend and make the week ahead a profitable and productive one!
Best Regards,
Consuelo

Charles de Vaulx: Leaving the Nest
Three years after departing First Eagle, Charles de Vaulx and company are thriving on their own.


Bridget B. Hughes, 02/28/2011
This article first appeared in the February/March 2011 issue of Morningstar Advisor magazine. Get your free subscription here.
In just longer than three years, International Value Advisers has amassed more than $13 billion in assets under management.


That's quite a feat for a firm, known as IVA,
that invests primarily in equities, considering the rough-and-tumble markets that investors have endured during that period. Its asset figure puts IVA among the 100 largest mutual fund families.
Thus, it would be stretching it to call the firm "undiscovered," especially considering that one of its top investment people, Charles de Vaulx, is fairly well-known among investors-- thanks in part to his many years managing funds at First Eagle, both in partnership with value-investing legend Jean-Marie Eveillard and on his own. During those years, de Vaulx established close relationships with many clients and shareholders, who appreciated his candor.
Still, IVA isn't a household name. And while you may think you know the firm's strategy and management well, there's more to tell-- including the fact that the firm will close its doors to investors on Feb. 18.
Nimble Is a Sticking PointIn some sense, IVA was born out of necessity. In 2007, a group of senior managers and analysts left First Eagle. Leaving were de Vaulx; Chuck de Lardemelle, who was First Eagle's director of research; Simon Fenwick, analyst and once manager of First Eagle Gold SGGDX; and analysts Thibaut Pizenberg and Michael Malafronte. While the reasons for their departures were varied (not surprisingly, the story differs somewhat depending on which side you talk to), the group had a clear idea of what it wanted for the future. Having worked well together for a number of years, the managers and analysts wanted to stick together--and, importantly, to continue to practice the patient and uncommon value approach they had employed on the First Eagle funds, something that couldn't be taken for granted at other firms. So, they formed a partnership and launched IVA.
Having control over their business was important to the partners. No outside investor was invited as a partner. They also wanted the ability to close their funds when they saw fit. De Vaulx had long argued that his approach requires a small and nimble asset base, because of regular forays into less-liquid smaller companies and high-yield bonds.
