Teri Miyahira Beauty July Review

July 19, 2017 ~ lilthingsmama 



It has been about a week and a half since I received the July Teri Miyahira Beauty box, and I’m in love! Teri Miyahira Beauty is a makeup line that is 100% natural, vegan, and cruelty-free. Teri also doesn’t use petroleum, dye, synthetic preservatives, and talc. Every box that I have received has been a great value and had a good selection of products. This box has been one of my favorites so far!
“Push Beyond”

Each box comes with a card that has product descriptions and ingredients on one side, and then a cute motivational design on the other side. Love the idea that she makes them inspirational and can be kept to decorate with. I loved the design of this months card!
“Seek” Powder Illuminator

With Teri’s powder products a little goes a long way. This illuminator is dense (trying to come up with the right word) and very pigmented. It is such a pretty rose gold color! Looking at the compact I was worried it would be too dark on my fair skin, but on the skin it is the perfect rosy highlight!
“Explore” Powder Bronzer

Loving this tone on my skin! It has a cooler tone to it than most bronzers I have seen, which is what I have been looking for. It gives a subtle warmth to my face and sculpts at the same time. The “Clarity” bronzer that was in an earlier box was too dark for my skin, so receiving this lighter more subtle bronzer made me super happy!
Reset Hydrating Fruit Enzyme Mask & Exfoliant

If you follow me on Instagram, you have seen my posts about loving face masks. I was sooooo excited to get a deluxe sample size of Teri’s Reset mask. It smells citrusy, and also has a strong banana scent to me. The consistency is very creamy and smooth. I like that it wasn’t extremely exfoliating and scrubby. This is a great mask to use during your self care time.
Vegan Rose Gold Face Artist Brush

How cute is this brush? I love the look of Teri’s rose gold makeup brushes! This face brush has a dense flatter brush that is so soft. It would be perfect for applying foundation or even using to apply the face mask that came in this box. I have a couple of her brushes and have loved each one of them.
Teri Miyahira’s makeup line is definitely high-end to me. It is not cheap, but you get great quality products with cleaner ingredients.
Thank you so much for reading! What is your favorite Teri Miyahira product? Comment below! 🙂

ABOUT






















Hi! I'm Teri Miyahira! 

Thanks so much for your interest in my namesake brand, TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY! If you've been following my work in the green beauty industry for the past years, you are already aware of my dedication to all-natural and cruelty-free living, not just for beauty products but for all aspects of lifestyle. After being exposed to the high fashion world as a full-time wardrobe stylist for print magazines, televised award shows, live TV and more in the first half of my professional career, and working with some of the world's most recognizable fashion brands, I've come to love the glamour and quality that luxury products offer. Working professionally in the high-fashion industry, doing Hollywood and working with celebrities, has taught me to develop my eye for style and aesthetics, especially when form must meet function.So when I jumped into the green beauty space, I was able to use the skills I developed in my fashion career to create very curated content in the beauty industry. My current editorial work in the green beauty world includes natural brands like Honest Beauty by Jessica Alba and many more behind-the-scenes content creation for brands in this space. But knowing that high-priced products aren't accessible to every budget, I felt a calling to figure out how to create luxury-quality green beauty products but for an affordable price.And hence, TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY was born.With a very unconventional business model of crossing limited-edition collections with a monthly membership service, TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY aims to create luxury all-natural and cruelty-free products for both those that are just starting to transition to green beauty, as well as for the natural aficionado who already appreciates clean ingredients and cruelty-free beauty, and doing so at the most affordable price possible. No skimping on ingredients, packaging, manufacturing or quality control here. No hidden synthetic ingredients either, such as other "natural" brands that use synthetic preservatives. And no claims to be cruelty-free when their parent owner is an animal testing company!Since I own 100% of the company, without using investor/outside capital to fund the business, or having a board of directors to "whisper in my ear" and negatively influence the decisions of the company, I'm proud to say that I have complete creative control over every single product that is included in each month's collection of TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY. This creative control ensures the best possible membership experience for you. This means the end of feeling like your subscription box was haphazardly thrown together with a bunch of throw-away sample sized products, or receiving unwearable makeup colors that you know you won't use more than once. Each item included in your monthly collection is curated by hand, by me alone, to ensure the best possible experience. And since outside brands are not included in any monthly collection, we never have to worry about products not complementing each other, or having too much skincare, or too little makeup. This type of oversight by including only TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY products in your monthly collection delivery means that we are ending the days of a "bad month" in the subscription box space. Because I think we've all experienced a few "bad months" when it comes to beauty membership services. I hope you enjoy TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY and the new way of doing green beauty. If you have a request for a specific color or formulation, please feel free to submit a request here! I would love your feedback since I work directly with laboratories and manufacturers.Thanks so much for your continued support and I'm so excited to be on this new journey with you!xoxoxoTeri​Teri MiyahiraFounder, TERI MIYAHIRA BEAUTY

Teri Miyahira Beauty Subscription Box Review – January 2017

This post may contain referral/affiliate links. Read the full disclosure. 



Teri Miyahira Beauty Box is a new natural and vegan beauty subscription box! Each month you’ll receive at least 2 full-size makeup items from Teri Miyahira’s own line made for this subscription. Everything in this box is vegan, natural, and cruelty-free.

My Subscription Addiction pays for this subscription. (Check out the review process post to learn more about how we review boxes).

The Subscription Box: Teri Miyahira Beauty (Waitlist Mode)
The Cost: $39 a month
The Products: Every monthly collection contains at least 2 x full-sized makeup items, and 1-2 medium sized skincare/bath/body items (no sample sizes here, ever!). The medium-sized products are big enough to last multiple uses so you can make sure the formulations are effective for you, and then you can purchase full-sizes of your favorites.
Ships to: Worldwide! Shipping costs apply to countries outside of the US.
Check out all of my Teri Miyahira Beauty Box reviews!
Keep Track of Your Subscriptions: Add this box to your subscription list or wishlist!
Make sure to sign up for the waitlist to get an alert when subscriptions open for the next box!

Each box comes with a card detailing the items included. (It also includes the ingredient lists for all beauty products.)

Now, onto the items!

Teri Miyahira “Expression” Eye and Brow Palette – Retail Value $58

Like every Teri Miyahira product I’ve tried so far, the pigment is excellent with these powders! The finish is matte, and they are great for both brow and eye shadow shades.

Here are all the shades swatched

I’m so happy with these shades. I love shimmery eyeshadows, but this is such a classic matte set – I know I’ll use this regularly.
And the last shade swatched:

Teri Miyahira “Renew” Pressed Eye Shadow – Retail Value $28

This eye shadow has a matte finish and is great for a subtle highlight under your brow or to use as an eye shadow base.

Teri Miyahira Vegan Rose Gold Brush Set – Value $64

This set includes a Flat Medium Brush, Angled Eye Brush, and Spoolie brush – perfect for eyebrow and eyeshadow application!
Verdict: This box has a retail value of about $180. These are premium makeup prices, but I am very impressed with the formulas, and definitely could see these products retailing for the prices listed. The packaging might not be up to par with premium makeup brands, but the formulas themselves are. (And if I could only pick one, I’d go with premium formulas every time!)
This is one of my favorite boxes from Teri because everything is such a usable basic – I definitely feel like I got my money’s worth this month.
In general, I’m impressed with the quality of the product, the value, and I appreciate that Teri Miyahira is so ingredient-conscious. If you are looking for a high-quality natural and/or vegan makeup line, I recommend this subscription!
The only critique I would make is that I wish this subscription allowed for some customization – with the cost, it would be a great way to help minimize the risk of getting makeup products that don’t work for your skin tone.
What do you think of the Teri Miyahira Beauty Box?

Written by Liz Cadman

Liz is the founder of My Subscription Addiction. She’s been hooked on subscription boxes since 2011 thanks to Birchbox, and she now subscribes to over 100 boxes. Her favorites include POPSUGAR Must Have, FabFitFun, and any box that features natural beauty products!



All views in this review are the opinion of the author. My Subscription Addiction will never accept payment in exchange for a review, but will accept a box at no cost to provide honest opinions on the box. This post may contain affiliate/referral links.

I also received this box, after re-subscribing, and I really paid attention to the packaging this time around because I noticed the constant disclaimers about it.  Last year when I was subscribed, I was actually impressed with the packaging because a lot of it was in glass.  I noticed the makeup is now in plastic packaging, but after really paying attention to it this time, I noticed it’s quite nice, thick, very durable, and essentially very good quality packaging overall.  I know she’s used sticker labels on lipsticks & deluxe samples, which I agree could be better merely for the sake of aesthetic purposes, but overall her packaging is on par with a lot of department store brands.  I see very high-end brands (both in skincare & makeup) that use just plastic packaging for their products too, which I think is great & not worth complaining about.  I’d rather have a company invest their money in the quality of their products rather than the packaging.  Okay, that’s all… I guess that little disclaimer keeps bugging me and I don’t think it’s warranted, but that’s on me. 🙂

Good points! After the first review, several readers mentioned they thought the packaging looked cheap compared to the retail prices listed, so I wanted to make sure I called out that the formulas themselves were excellent. But, maybe I can rephrase that disclaimer to be a little clearer!
Glad you like the products, too!

The pigmentation of the shadows is INSANE. Please keep reviewing this sub, as I may have to subscribe myself if the quality of the products are consistently this amazing.
