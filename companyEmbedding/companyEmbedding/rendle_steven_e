Good day and welcome to the VF Corporation First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Joe Alkire - VF Corp.
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.
Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominately in adjusted and currency neutral terms, which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion, because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.
During the second quarter of 2017, VF announced it had reached an agreement to sell its License Sports Group, or LSG, business to Fanatics Inc. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the Licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses.
Accordingly, the company classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During the third quarter of 2016, the company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses. Accordingly, the company has classified the assets and liabilities of Contemporary Brands businesses as held for sale as of March 2016 and included the results of those businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.
Joining me on today's call will be VF President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. VF's first quarter results were right in line with our expectations. Our growth engines continue to deliver solid results, despite a retail backdrop that continues to experience disruption and consolidation, particularly here in the United States.
Overall revenue was down 1% during the quarter, but this doesn't tell the whole story. The momentum we see building in our largest brands and in our international and direct-to-consumer platforms is strong. And our first quarter results give me confidence in our expectation for accelerated growth as we move through 2017.

For the quarter Vans, The North Face, and Timberland grew at a combined rate of 4% with strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7% respectively. Our international business grew 5%, and our China business delivered an impressive 10% growth rate. Direct-to-consumer grew 7%, including a mid-single digit comp. And our digital business was up more than 25%. We're really pleased with this solid performance.
Operational discipline and sharp focus on fundamentals led to a 190 basis point improvement in our gross margin during the quarter. Our gross margin drivers remain intact. And our strong margin expansion will fuel investment in our strategic priorities and provide flexibility as we execute against our 2021 plan. It's an important and sustainable part of our model.
EPS was down 3% to $0.52 in the first quarter. That being said, know that our earnings growth was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to a higher tax rate. That means that our EPS growth would've been 5% excluding the tax headwind. Scott will cover this in more detail later in the call.
One of the core pillars of our strategy is to reshape our portfolio. We've shared with you in detail the strategic and financial filters we use to evaluate our existing portfolio and also our acquisition pipeline.
In early April we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our LSG business to Fanatics. This announcement is another example of our work as active portfolio managers and our intention to move faster. On a personal note the LSG and JanSport collegiate employees have been part of the VF family for many years, and I thank them for their service and wish them all continued success.
Pace of change in our industry and the broader consumer landscape is accelerating. The choices and capabilities embedded in our 2021 strategic growth plan positions us to win and will serve as a catalyst for VF's accelerated growth. We will become a more agile and consumer centric organization. We will reshape our portfolio. And we are a diversified value creation company.
So with that let's dive into our first quarter results and look at our top five brands and Workwear.
Starting with The North Face. Global revenue was up 8% with strength in the Americas and Europe offset by a slight decline in Asia-Pacific, which we did expect. Excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas business, which didn't really impact us until the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North Face was up at a low double digit rate. Our revenue growth during the quarter was balanced with low double digit growth in D2C and mid-single digit growth in wholesale.
By region, Americas grew 4%, driven by low teen growth in D2C with strong results from e-commerce, which grew nearly 20%. This was offset by a low single digit decrease in wholesale due to the impact of the bankruptcies. From a product standpoint, rainwear performed well in the quarter, driven by the launch of our new Apex Flex Gore-Tex jacket, which provides comfort and protection coupled with a new fit and aesthetic.
In Europe, The North Face was up 19% as its strong momentum continued. The wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 30%. The business remains well-balanced with strong results across all product categories and channels, which we expect to continue for the balance of the year.
In Asia, as expected, first quarter revenue was down 1%, as low double digit growth in D2C was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. As the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace. We continue to expect high single digit growth in 2017, primarily weighted toward the second half.

While revenue growth at The North Face was slightly above our expectations for the first quarter, there's no change to our outlook for mid-single digit revenue growth for the brand in 2017.
Now switching to Vans. Global revenue was up 7% with broad based growth across all regions of the world and all product franchises. From a channel perspective, D2C increased at a high teen rate, while wholesale was flat, as growth in the Americas and Asia was offset by an expected decline in Europe.
Vans Americas business was up 6%, driven by low double digit D2C growth, including more than 20% growth in e-commerce. The wholesale business increased at a low single digit rate. As you'd expect our wide range of product continues to resonate with consumers, with Classics and particularly the Old Skool fueling success in D2C and wholesale.
And building on our commitment to deep consumer connectivity, the brand opened a permanent House of Vans in Chicago, a pop-up House of Vans in Toronto, and three pop-up House of Vans locations in Mexico.
In Europe, the Vans turnaround story continues to take hold with 1% growth during the quarter. Our D2C business remains strong, with 20% growth driven by a 30% increase in e-commerce and a high-teen comp growth. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single digit rate. With inventory levels in the channel now normalizing and double digit growth in our fall order book, we're on track to deliver high single digit growth in Europe in 2017.
In Asia, for the third consecutive quarter Vans delivered more than 20% growth. This was fueled by more than 50% growth in D2C with strength across all markets driven by exceptional growth in the digital space in China. Wholesale increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in China and Korea. Looking to 2017, we are confident in our low double digit growth outlook for the Vans brand.
In line with our expectations Timberland global revenue decreased 4% with low single digit growth in D2C and high single digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas decreased 7%, as mid-single digit growth in our D2C business, including almost 30% growth in e-commerce, was offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale.
We continue to work on diversifying our business toward a more balanced assortment, which will reduce our reliance on Classic boots in the Americas region. This is the strategy we outlined at the Investor Day, and it's the same successful strategy that has led to more consistent balanced growth in our international business.
While not yet to scale in the Americas, we are seeing tremendous success in our men's casual platforms, such as SensorFlex and AeroCore. Our D2C business has the right assortment. And the growth we are seeing gives us confidence that we have the right strategy.
However, the product transition in the wholesale channel will take a little longer to play out. As we diversify the assortment, and our retail partners work through inventory in the boot category, we expect the Americas business to return to growth in the second half of 2017.
Timberland revenue in Europe was in line with 2016 levels, as low single digit growth in D2C was offset by flat revenue in wholesale. As expected, wholesale revenue in the quarter was impacted by timing of shipments in our distributor business. We expect Timberland Europe to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate into the high single digit range in the second half of 2017, supported by the order book, which is now fully allocated.
Revenue in Timberland's Asia business was down 5%. D2C declined a mid-single digit rate, as strong e-commerce growth in China and low single digit comp growth was offset by our decision to reduce underperforming doors in some of our mature markets. Wholesale was down at a high single digit rate.

For 2017 we continue to expect Timberland to grow in the low single digit range. We expect the brand to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, as our international business gains momentum, and we continue to evolve our product segmentation and assortment in the Americas.
Looking at Wrangler, global revenue for the first quarter was down 9% with low double digit growth in D2C more than offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region a low teen revenue decline in the U.S. offset high teen growth in our non-U.S. Americas business. And revenue in Europe and Asia declined at a low single digit rate for the quarter.
As we've discussed, our U.S. business has been impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and continued channel consolidation. These actions will affect our business primarily in the first half and growth should return by year end. We're working closely with our key retail partners. But our visibility regarding timing is low and the variability is hard to predict.
While quarter-to-quarter forecasting will be difficult, our past experience tells us several things that we can expect once the repositioning is complete. First, strong brands like Wrangler will command even stronger positions, as smaller brands are edited out. And second, superior supply chain and replenishment capabilities give us an advantaged position.
Regarding product, this week we announced that we are expanding our offerings for the spring season with a men's collection that is built for the outdoors. The Wrangler Outdoor line incorporates multifunctional features ideal for the outdoor enthusiast. Made of performance materials that keep the wearer cool, dry, and comfortable, these products also feature UPF 30 to protect the consumer from the sun. This is a perfect example of our efforts to transform Wrangler into more of a lifestyle brand, while keeping it connected to its heritage and its loyal consumer.
Switching to Lee, revenue declined 6% during the quarter with mid-teen growth in D2C offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. Low single digit growth in Europe, Asia, and our non-U.S. Americas business was offset by a low double digit decline in the U.S.
BODY OPTIX continues to perform well in Asia, comprising about 25% of our women's business. We plan to bring this to Europe and to North America later this fall.
In the U.S. our men's business continues to deliver solid growth, as X-Treme Comfort Khakis and Extreme Motion denim continue to resonate with the Lee consumer. However, ongoing channel weakness and challenging conditions in our women's business are impacting results. For 2017, we continue to expect Jeanswear revenue to be in line with 2016 levels.
And finally, I'd like to highlight Workwear, the business we recently presented as a new growth platform for VF. Workwear, which includes our Image business as well as Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear, increased 1% during the quarter. Our Image business was negatively impacted by the timing of a government contract between Q4 and Q1 and declined 5%. However, our largest brands within Workwear were strong, as the recovery in the industrial sector continues.
Timberland PRO grew 15%, Bulwark was up 17%, and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear increased 13%. Given our expectation for accelerated growth through the balance of 2017 and the inherent profitability of this business, we are even more optimistic about the Workwear opportunity.
And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Thanks, Steve. Before I cover the first quarter in detail, let me provide a few comments regarding the LSG transaction and how it impacted our first quarter results relative to the outlook we provided in February.

As you know, in early April we announced that we had reached an agreement with Fanatics to sell our LSG business. The sale price is about $225 million pre-tax, subject to working capital and other adjustments. And we expect to close this transaction very shortly.
In conjunction with the sale of LSG we are also exiting the Licensing business of JanSport collegiate. Accordingly, the results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued ops, and the prior periods have been adjusted.
In 2016 these businesses contributed about $575 million of revenue and roughly $0.13 of EPS. We provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding the Licensing business, so you can see the full impact.
Relative to the first quarter of 2017, before restructuring and other charges triggered by the transaction, these businesses contributed about $0.03 of EPS during the quarter. So relative to the outlook we provided in February, our LSG and JanSport collegiate businesses contributed about $130 million of revenue. And our continuing operations EPS of $0.52 would've been $0.55 on a like-for-like basis.
So with that out of the way, let's review the first quarter results. In line with our expectations, revenue was down 1% on a currency neutral basis to $2.6 billion. Our growth engines delivered solid results in the quarter. Our big three brands were up 4% on a combined basis with particular strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7%, respectively. And as the industrial recovery continues to evolve, Bulwark, Timberland PRO, and Wrangler RIGGS grew at a mid-teen rate.
Our international business grew 5%, and China remained particularly strong with 10% growth. And our Direct to Consumer business was up 7% in the quarter, including more than 25% growth in our Digital business. Now to unpack our Direct to Consumer results a little further, our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved low double digit growth during the quarter.
Wholesale revenue was down 4% due to a key customer's inventory action in our Jeanswear North American business, the impact of bankruptcies in Outdoor & Action Sports, and difficult conditions in the department store channel, which continue to pressure our Sportswear businesses. In contrast, our international wholesale delivered low single digit growth, and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a combined rate in the mid-teens.
I want to take a few minutes to provide more context around our outlook for the Jeanswear business in 2017. There is no change to our outlook of about flat revenue for the year. Our international business remains solid, with particular strength in Europe and Asia, where we expect low to mid-single digit growth this year. We continue to expect our business in North America to decline at a low single digit rate, as a result of the previously mentioned inventory destocking. This impact will primarily be in the first half.
Now, despite the short-term noise, it's important to keep focused on the end game. We are confident that our Jeanswear brands are strong and our superior supply chain places us in an advantaged position, once the process is complete. However, our visibility regarding timing is low. Therefore, the quarter to quarter variability will be hard to predict.
Gross margin remained strong at 50.2%, up 150 basis points on a reported basis, which included a 40 basis point negative impact for FX. That's a 190-basis-point increase on a currency-neutral basis. As we mentioned in February, we are sharply focused on fundamentals and willing to sacrifice a little growth in the near term for quality. Our efforts are clearly paying off in the gross margin line. And we believe our decisions will improve the long-term health of both our brands and the marketplace.

SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 200 basis points to 38.9%. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment, we continue to invest in strategic priorities, D2C, and in particular, digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, while our overall SG&A expense was up just 3%, investments and strategic priorities accounted for more than all of that increase, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.
And as our growth accelerates in the second half and we begin to realize the full benefits of our agility and optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in our SG&A ratio in the second half and into 2018.
First quarter operating margin declined 50 basis points to 11.3%, primarily as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency. On a currency neutral basis our operating margin during the quarter was down 10 basis points to 11.7%.
So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS declined 3% on a currency neutral basis to $0.52 in the quarter. However, our EPS rate was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to lower discrete tax benefits, primarily as a result of the adoption of the equity comp accounting standard last year. Excluding the discrete tax impact, EPS on a currency neutral basis was up at a mid-single digit rate.
Turning to our balance sheet. Our inventory increased 2%. And as promised, we continued to return capital to shareholders, as we repurchased about $440 million of stock. As we announced in March, our board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program to support the capital allocation priorities we laid out in our 2021 plan.
As we look to the balance of 2017, we are updating our outlook to incorporate the sale of the Licensing business. Reported revenue is still expected to be up at a low single digit rate, including about a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. However, this is off an adjusted 2016 base to reflect the sale of LSG. We expect gross margin to improve about 20 basis points to 49.6%, which includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX.
Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis, including about a 60 basis point negative impact from FX.
Currency neutral EPS is still expected to be up at a mid-single digit rate in 2017 or down at a low single digit rate compared to 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.98.
While there is no change to our currency neutral revenue and EPS outlook for the full year, I'd like to make a few comments relative to the first outlook – first half outlook we provided in February.
First, our Licensing business contributed about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS per quarter during 2016, so that should help you think about your models. Second, as we mentioned, our visibility in Jeanswear North America is low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is hard to predict right now. While there is no change to our annual outlook for Jeanswear, it's hard to predict which side of the Q2/Q3 quarter break orders may fall. As a result, were providing an EPS outlook in a range of $0.27 to $0.30 for the second quarter.
So in closing, the first quarter of our 2021 strategic plan played out as expected. We are confident in our mid-single digit earnings growth outlook for 2017 and in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half. We are focused on fundamentals and becoming a more agile and retail centric organization. And we are committed to becoming a more active portfolio manager, while delivering top-quartile TSR through our diversified model. We are a value creation company.
And with that I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we'll open up the call for your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the 4% decline in the wholesale business. I think in the prepared remarks I think it was noted that it was primarily due to a key U.S. customer. Any sense what the wholesale business would've looked like if we strip out that customer?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Well, you're right, Laurent. It was driven by the U.S. customer, particularly in our Jeans business. But we also called out our Sportswear business was a little tough in the quarter as well. So I think if you stripped those out, really if you look, our – we did see growth in our larger brands as well as our international business. And also importantly our digital accounts as well, we saw mid-teen growth.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. Very helpful. And then on international revenues I wanted to follow up on last quarter's guide that Europe and Asia would both grow at a high single digit rate for the year. In light of the first quarter results for those regions can you possibly walk us through how we should think about those regions? How they'll grow in the first half versus the second half?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Well, I think I'll start with Europe. We are seeing – the largest acceleration in the second half will be in our Vans business. This has been a really great story over the last several quarters, where we've seen sequential improvement. In fact we returned to growth, although it was modest, in the first quarter.
But based on the order book we see going forward, we're seeing double digit positive order books in Europe. And that's going to be a big driver. That has been a big driver consistently in our Europe business. And we're really excited to see that come roaring back, because that's also a very profitable business. As CFO I like that.
Also on the second half our digital business, our e-comm, is where we see the majority of that. It's more second half weighted. And based on the trends, while the trends won't necessarily get larger as a percentage, the absolute amount of business is larger, as well as the openings that we've had from a D2C standpoint in the first half, as those start to pay off in the second half. So generally, that's the trend we see in both regions, which gives us confidence. Steve?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
And, Laurent, I would just add a little bit there. I mean clearly it is the return of strong growth with our Vans business. I mentioned we have a very strong back half order book.
But it's also the continued growth and the high level performance from our North Face brand in Europe. Our Timberland brand comes back to very strong growth as we see our expanded apparel offer, a stronger women's offer coming into the second half.
But we also – it's the strength of our Vans brand in Asia that continues to drive that strong double digit growth and gives us confidence in that back half growth.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
More than 20% growth in Asia, right?
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Very helpful. Best of luck.

We'll go next to Michael Binetti of UBS.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Morning, Michael.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
I just wanted to ask a couple modeling things really quickly. On the FX we've seen that – it's been pretty volatile here recently. I was actually a little surprised to see that it was still just a 2% estimate in your – the way that you're modeling it for the year on the impact to revenue for the year. Is that – I mean is that – would you mind helping us with how you're pegging the euro or maybe the pound on that? Just so we understand what you're looking at in case things change more through this quarter, which obviously they could, tend to be volatile.

Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Sure, Michael. So we looked at the last 90 days basically average and that's essentially what we've – for all our basket of currencies. And yeah, some of them are positive like the euro and others not as much. But what we've done is we've looked about at the last 90 days and gone – projected that going forward.
So if the currencies, if the dollar continues to weaken, could that be a tailwind for us? Yeah, it could. But based on what we're seeing right now in our forward projections, we're not counting on that trend continuing. And it's slightly beneficial, but it's not material to the overall results.
The other thing I'd just remind everybody is about 80% of our transactional exposure is hedged. So from an in-country profitability standpoint, there is some variability, but not a lot.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Right. And then I think just you mentioned something I think around Timberland. But I was surprised to see it looks like only about four net new store openings in the quarter versus last quarter. It sounded like you had a couple closures, though.
Maybe we could get a little bit of context behind how you're thinking about the seasonality of the store openings this year. Because I think if we just look at some of the longer term run rates you gave us at the Analyst Day, it looks like that you'd be opening at a lot faster pace than what you reported in the first quarter.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yes. Maybe I'll start there. So one of the things that we said, Michael, is that we're going to take a hard look at the productivity of our stores and profitability. And in Asia and in particular, we have a large business in some of the more mature markets like Japan there. Where frankly, we've struggled a bit. And we've taken a step back from a store footprint there based on productivity.
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I guess just one last one. I think you had a – for North Face you had a competitor I guess this week talking about a little bit more of a cautious outlook for the U.S. on orders through the year, which is unusual from the standpoint of the first quarter, taking a more cautious outlook for the year. Can you just talk about your North Face outlook in the Americas? Obviously the Europe numbers are great. But for the Americas this year, what gives you confident in the order book you have today? And how much variability there is around those numbers if things change through the year?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Sure. I'll grab that one, Michael. As you heard, we reaffirmed our mid-single digit growth outlook for the year. Really happy with our first quarter results, as we came through the colder January, February. And then the launch of some new products here at the back half of Q1.
I think the key here is, as we came through last year and the decisions that we made to clean up the marketplace and focus on, first, quality sales, the orders that we have in hand are really driven against the sell-through we saw last year and very thoughtful growth rates across each of the wholesale partners that we have.
There's some new products coming in our higher end Summit Series, some new ski and snowboard styles that are giving us confidence with that wholesale distribution.
But I think the key here also is our D2C is performing really well. And we see our digital platform driving strong growth. And certainly that's the higher quality product offer, but it's also the impact of a cleaner marketplace and not having to compete with a large amount of off-priced goods, some ours, some others. But I think that all of that kind of aggregate gives us confidence against that mid-single digit outlook that we just reaffirmed
Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.

We'll go next to Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.
Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Good morning.
Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just a question. I wanted to focus on Timberland in the U.S. So I'm just trying to look at the numbers. And D2C is up mid-singles, so it looks like with the current product you have, things look good. And the wholesale channel is down low double digits. So just kind of curious if you could contextualize it. How much of it is just a channel inventory issue, and you just need that to get kind of cleaned up, versus the current product pipeline performance?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Yeah. So I think you've characterized it really well. We talked at the Investor Day, and I think we really see that continuing right now is our – a little bit more dependent on boots here in the U.S. than we see in other parts of the world, specifically Europe. And a lot of work going on right now to work on product segmentation and really leveling the different franchises that sit within each of the different channel partners.
We are moving through some boot inventory, as we place our SensorFlex and AeroCore franchises at a better rate. But where we are able to get that front and center is in our own D2C. And that is where we're seeing really strong reactions. And in our e-commerce platform where we were up 30%.
So it's really moving through inventory. It's getting – really creating the space to place these new franchises and using the proof points that we see in our own D2C here in the U.S. But also the performance that we've seen in our European platform in taking those learnings back here to our domestic market.
Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And if I could, Scott, one more for you on the Jeanswear side. I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So on one hand it sounds like you're saying you think the Jeanswear business could begin to improve in the back half of this year. But I thought you were – you discussed at the Analyst Day that you didn't really expect the pressure in that segment to abate until early 2019. And that's why you thought the business would start to inflect more on the top line at that point.
Can you help me just kind of understand? I mean I know you don't have a lot of visibility, given what's going on there right now.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. Yeah.
Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
But just how do I take those two comments and think about them?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. So first of all, as you think about the pace of the year, we're going to see sequential improvement as the year progresses. And if you think about it just kind of big picture, you got a destocking that's occurring through the first half, which is again one of the reasons we talked about the variability and lack of visibility, is we don't fully control the timing of how markdowns and floors are cleared and all that. That's our customers' decision, right? Not ours.
But we know where we're going to end up at the end. And at the end of the year – by the end of the year we should, according to their plans, be through the destocking phase and getting into the new floor set by the end of the year. We have visibility to what programs we have. We know what the expectations are. But the way this is laying out is a narrower assortment with higher velocity. And again, these are a lot of assumptions.
So we should see that higher velocity start to pay off in the second half. And that's what I meant by the acceleration by the end of the year.
Now if you zoom out a click and go back to the Investor Day, we know that there are a number of factors in that channel of distribution which cause variability. One of those is the repositioning of a major customer. There's other customers that have been closing doors. And there's other disruptions that are occurring.

So my comments at the Investor Day were more of a broader picture, to say that while quarter to quarter we could see some disruption and choppiness, if you keep the end game in mind and think about the big picture here, we really like where we're going to end up once all this plays out. Right?
That is, we own the strongest brand in that category with the Wrangler brand. We know that in a narrower assortment, big brands win. And there's more focus on replenishment and quick supply chain capabilities. That plays right into our strengths.
So, one of those comments is more tactical. Just it's going to be really hard quarter to quarter to thread the needle exactly on what we expect. But we know where the end game is. And the other is, if you keep your eye on the prize here, we like strategically where we're going to end up in the jeans section, given what we believe are some core advantages, strength of brand and strength of supply chain.
Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator
We'll go next to Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.
Omar Saad - Evercore ISI
Thanks for taking my question.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Morning, Omar.
Omar Saad - Evercore ISI
Morning. Wanted to talk to you about kind of a dichotomy between the U.S. trends in the business here versus in Europe and Asia, where there seems to be a growing kind of separation.
Do you feel like that some of the challenges in the U.S. and the wholesale channel and promotionality going on over here, do you feel like these issues are going to stay confined to the American market, the North American market? And there's – Europe and Asia are structurally different industries and those challenges can be avoided in those markets? Or do you think they eventually flow globally, kind of from an industry level?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
I'll try to answer that question, Omar. Some of that is looking at a crystal ball. But what I would say, what we see in our international business, where really things are not necessarily that much easier, our brands are doing extremely well. The thoughtful approach to segmentation and really placing the right product collections in each of these distribution channel partners' doors. And how we're using our retail and digital platforms to build our brands' breadth and depth with consumer is helping us outperform the marketplace.
Here in the U.S. it's clear that we've got ourselves in a really uneven and inconsistent performance. But there are retailers and there are brands that are doing well in this marketplace. We're going to settle through retail closures. We all read the same reports.
But I think the thing that we all need to really remember is that strong brands that have a very authentic connection with consumers, that are delivering unique products that provide consumers the opportunity to enjoy the experiences that they look for, position brands to succeed in this marketplace.
We'll navigate this because of the strength of our portfolio. And it's really the learnings that we take in our European and Asia markets that are helping us fine tune our approach to segmentation and the use of the various product collections in those channels that's giving us confidence that we'll navigate it.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. I'd just add on to that, Omar. There are some fundamental differences. The U.S., we all look at the same numbers, right? The U.S. is over-stored as a general statement, much more than what you would see in Europe and Asia. So that's one issue.
Also remember the relative time in market and maturity of our brands are less internationally. So we have a lot of room to run there, just from penetration and an expansion standpoint. So if you think about our business vis-à-vis those markets, that's how we look at it.

And lastly, in the U.S., while its macro trends are certainly true, and again we've tried to say we will see disruption and choppiness as certain contractions and consolidations happen. There are clear winners out there, too, right? And we are winning with those winning retailers. And that's another reason why from a strategic standpoint, we've really pivoted and focused on our D2C and particularly our digital business.
And you might remember from the Investor Day, 85% of our growth is coming from digital and digital partners. And of that 15% that's essentially in international.
So in the next five years, we're not expecting much on a net basis from wholesale in the U.S. We will be winning disproportionately with some vendors. And we're also expecting that there will be continued consolidation that's going to occur over the next five years

That's really helpful, guys. Could I also ask a question about Timberland? That business continues to strengthen a little bit. Do you feel like you've got the right strategy and plan in place for that brand? Or is it really just more of a market level issue? Where that kind of active lifestyle has shifted away maybe from that rugged outdoor aesthetic to more of the athletic, athleisure aesthetic and you just kind of have to wait for that cycle to play out? Thanks.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Omar, I mean, there's clearly a cycle that we're all seeing right now with the retro athletic. But to the point on Timberland, we absolutely believe we have the right strategy. And the proof point is what we see going on with our European business, who was much quicker to diversify across multiple franchises, specifically SensorFlex and the launch of AeroCore and have really brought down the percent to total of the boots, the total boot collection.
We were slow to do that here in the United States market. And that work is underway. Jim [Pisani] did I thought a good job really of being able to explain that at the Investor Day. That work is underway.
Concurrently, we've really elevated our apparel product creation, sitting now in our Stabio office, leveraging the strength of our apparel machine there. We're really seeing that investment pay out in our European marketplace. As that starts to come here to the U.S., we have confidence that that will be a growth driver.
But we're also unlocking women's growth. And you'll remember the three focuses for Timberland are their men's business and the diversification across new franchises, women's and apparel. And again, the women's business and the strength that we're seeing with products designs in Europe that we're now bringing back into our Americas marketplace gives us confidence that we have the right product as we begin to be more diligent around segmentation and really diversifying those collections appropriately.

Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.

We'll go to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on innovation behind The North Face brand. It feels like for the last three years to four years, it's been concentrated around FuseForm, ThermoBall in particular. I guess first question, how much white space is left for these platforms to run? And then is there anything you can share with us on kind of what's next? How your thinking about better balancing the spring versus the fall line? Thanks.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
No, Erinn, very good question. If you remember back in the Q4 call, I've talked about we need to own some of where The North Face finds itself today. We've leaned heavily on ThermoBall for the last three seasons. FuseForm, an interesting technology, and material innovation is important for our outerwear and ski wear.

But what we need to be doing is really being much more thoughtful around multiyear line plans and product lifecycle management, married to our innovation platform. There are a number of innovation projects underway, specifically around materials but also design concepts for outerwear, footwear, equipment, and some very specifically in Sportswear. As now as we bring new leadership into both the overall brand and product, we're lining up that multiyear model with our innovation platform.
And there's some exciting things coming this fall. I don't remember if I saw you at the Outdoor Retailer show. But there was an introduction of a new portion of our Summit Series collection engineered for ski mountaineering. But that also is having influence on some of the broader apparel product. And you're just seeing better designed product, more thoughtful use of materials, color, and fit. That we have a lot of confidence will open up the lens for our core consumers, but also broaden the lens for new consumers.
And were seeing this prove out in our European business. I've talked about that a lot, but it's no secret that our European business is very, very successful right now. And it is the focus on product, the segmentation of that product into specific channel partners and our own stores. But it's also the quality of the leadership and really driving those very specific choices and being able to, season after season, build that momentum through really thoughtful product line management.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Scott, for you. Just going back to how you were kind of articulating the guidance, you talked about significant SG&A leverage in the back half. Can you just expound upon that? I guess if sales in the second half – you're obviously planning for a big acceleration as well.
So if, whether it's environment or further bankruptcy, the sales weren't as high. Let's say they were in the low single digit range or mid-single. How do we think about kind of what the leverage you have on the SG&A would be in the back half? Thanks.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. So first of all as CFO, I think every cost is variable. So that's probably kind of underneath your question, but – and so what does our guidance imply? So we said about 14% operating margin. And with the margin expansion that would imply an increase in SG&A. And you see that's relatively higher in the first part. And we see – we leverage that in the second half, and it comes down.
First of all, I'd say we have a pretty good line of sight to the second half of the year. Right? And so we're not expecting a tremendous volatility. We see our order book. We see the trends. Now there's always some variability possible. But we have a lot of confidence in the second half. So that's the first comment I'd make.
So secondly, we're also – we outlined a strategic plan in our Boston meeting. And we are investing behind those priorities. So the point I was trying to make by significant leverage is, obviously as the top line accelerates, we're going to see leverage, right, in the second half.
We're also taking a lot of – a hard look at all the nonstrategic SG&A. We have a transformation project that we're going on – that we're undertaking here. And I'd call it more of a philosophy than a project actually. And we're challenging every spend item that we have in the P&L and saying, if it's not directly related to bringing our strategy forward, then we're empowering our leaders to take a hard look at that.
And the fruits of that labor are, we're going to – we're seeing and will continue to see leverage in those nonstrategic areas. Our thought is that is a fuel that we put right back and reinvest against those strategic priorities.

So again second, relative as the top line grows, we're going to see second half leverage. Remember in the first half we have a bit of a perfect storm. Right? We're opening our D2C – we're opening D2C stores. We see relative low wholesale growth for all the reasons that we detailed in our prepared remarks and some of the questions. We see that accelerating in the second half, and that's where you start to see that leverage.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Got it. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Thanks, Erinn.

We'll go next to Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Hey, Bob.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Bob.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
I was wondering if you could spend a little time just on Vans? The trends that you're seeing especially in the U.S. and the competitive set? Their inventory levels?
And then the second question that I have is on the inventory levels in the business. So like with wholesale revenues being down 4% and inventories I think were up 2%, can you talk about how like wholesale inventories are for you guys heading into the remainder of the year? And how you're planning the wholesale part of the business versus your D2C part of the business, given that your expectations are for a significant pickup in the second half of the year?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
So, Bob, I'll take Vans and then let Scott grab that second question. So from a Vans standpoint here in the U.S. – but it, really it applies to how the Vans businesses is managing itself across each of the regions – is just a really strong, broad, diversified set of products, starting first with footwear. And not depending on a single style but really leveraging the Classics and then there within Old Skool, bringing new innovations in their Pro Skate collection.
We're looking at new launches in apparel, launched a new Authentic Chino this spring, helped brought to market through our innovation platform. Just how we use the different franchises that we have across each of these apparel and footwear collections in their segmentation strategy. And how we bring those to life in our stores and digital I think really separates Vans from the rest of the marketplace.
And it's their intense focus on their consumer and the focusing on those emotional elements of music, art, and street culture. And how we are connecting digitally with our consumers. Our customs platform, which we launched last year, continues to accelerate, as we expand (50:08) the offer and the means by which consumers can upload content to have us then transfer that onto footwear.
They're just bringing a lot of new ideas each season across each of these different categories of product. And doing it consistently across the globe and tying that to the experiences that they have through marketing and events, really separates them from the rest of the marketplace and I think kind of puts them in a category in many ways in their own right.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. And so, Bob, versus you – or kind of your inventory related question. So a couple things. Number one, we do have pretty good line of sight to the balance of the year. So as it relates to the quality of our inventory, we feel good about that. Right? We don't see any issues and from a quality standpoint.
Also remember that the marketplace is substantially cleaner as we look at it. Now there's a few – there's always a few pockets here and there. But as an overall statement, we would say that retail inventories are in good shape. And we don't see any issues on a go forward basis.
Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Great. Thank you very much.

We'll go next to Kate McShane of Citi.
Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, with your guidance for Q2 of $0.27 to $0.30, I know you said the visibility to Jeanswear is tough, because you don't quite know where it's going to break. But what are you assuming for Jeanswear in order to get to that EPS growth?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. So we're looking at down mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter. That's what our current guidance implies. And again what we're saying is we've seen some variability frankly in the first quarter. It was the timing shifted a little bit from us, and it was a little more severe than we had anticipated. We had some offsets, which helped us get back on an overall basis. And so we would – that's really what's behind the comment. Just a little uncertainty on how the timing of all this is going to wind through the process.
Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And would you say what you're assuming is a base case scenario? Or...
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Well, if you back up, if you go to the high end of our range, that's essentially in line with what we said in February. Right? So we're saying we see a path to – and remember all this is excluding LSG. So the guidance we gave in February included LSG. We've kind of given you the roadmap on how to model, taking LSG out of it. So excluding that impact, the $0.30 would be right in line with our previous outlook. And we're saying there could be as much as a $0.03 variation on that, based on the timing of Jeanswear.
Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then my second question is, I know there have been some management changes in the Outdoor coalition and I think North Face as well. I just wondered if you could walk us through some of the newer hires that have been made? And if there are still any bigger positions that still need to be filled?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Sure, Kate, I'll do that. There have been some changes in our Outdoor business. Last year we made a change at Timberland in Jim Pisani, who presented at the Investor Conference, is our new leader there. Very excited about the leadership that he's bringing to that team.
I think The North Face is where we have two openings of significance, our President and our Head of Product. We are very close to naming a new President for The North Face brand. And with that shortly thereafter with that individual's participation we'll make that move on [Head of] Product.
The good news is we have some really steady strong sets of hands in that business. Scott Baxter, out head of that group is working day to day with our North Face brand. We've recently moved Arne Arens from Europe, our GM of our European business is now our GM of the Americas. Arne has presented at the Investor Conference. Very strong history with our brands, strong leadership, and deep, deep understanding of our brand.
So really feel confident about where we are in our North Face kind of time line. And the – really the search that we've utilized to identify that new leader.
Now we also placed a new President at Smartwool. And Travis [Campbell] comes to us from a relatively similar background, very strong general management skills, passion for this category and the outdoors. And he's bringing really good leadership to that brand. So those would be those openings that we've had and feeling good about where we are.
Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

We'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Robert W Baird.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yes. Hi. Thanks. Scott, if I could ask just a clarification on the guidance for the full year first of all. I understand 2016 coming lower when you exclude the LSG business. I'm just wondering the thought on holding the earnings decline rate for 2017. I would assume that you might have some proceeds from LSG that you could put to productive use through buying back stock or something like that. So any comment on either the proceeds or kind of the assumptions behind holding the growth rate?

Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. No. Good question. So we talked about returning $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, which includes a $1 billion repurchase. Obviously, we had some line of sight to what's going on with LSG. And so we were assuming those proceeds in that $1 billion buyback. So we are not intending to increase the $1 billion at this time.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the gross margin cadence through the year, I just wanted to ask about some of the puts and takes. I mean, obviously the first quarter was strong. And I think might account for your entire full-year projected gross margin increase. So I'm just wondering for the next three quarters what some of the puts and takes you see there.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. I'd say it was really strong by the way. So, yeah, we saw mix was really strong in the first quarter, about 80 basis points. And that's close to what we see for the year, a little less than that for the year. And our rate was up 110 basis points.
Several factors there. So we do see some price benefit. It's about 1% for the full year. And that's a little bit more toward the first half. Cost, the same. We see cost benefit in the first half. That actually turns the other way in the second half and for the year. And that's to kind of a small number. Those are some different – those are two shaping things.
And then finally, if you just think about that mix number as it evolves. So as our Jeanswear business accelerates, as our Image business accelerates throughout the year, you're going to see some of that mix come back the other direction. So off to a really good start one quarter in.
The other thing I would just remind everybody at this point, we're one quarter in and we got a lot of real estate ahead of us. So could we have been a little conservative? Maybe. But looking at the balance of puts and takes, we think that's a prudent place to be one quarter into the year.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And just to follow up, your prepared remark about sacrificing a little growth for quality near term. Is that more backward looking in the last quarter or two? Or do you see that continuing?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Well, I think you'll see a continuation of that philosophy. Now the reality is, a lot of that is behind us now in terms of, we're not doing much off-price. There's not much included in this outlook for 2017, because we've already cleaned a lot of that up.
In general, what we've said is, we would prefer to dispose of things through our own outlets. It's more brand appropriate. And that's really why they're there. And so if that means holding a little inventory and selling it through in a more brand enhancing way, then we're going to make that choice.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. Just to follow up on that too. I think you're starting to really see – I said this in my prepared remarks, but we believe we're really starting to see that philosophy pay off. And of the best proxies for that is gross margin. And we're really encouraged to see that strong gross margin rate in the first quarter. We talked about focus on fundamentals. That's one of the markers that shows that the strategy is paying off.

We'll go next to Sam Poser, Susquehanna.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you for taking my question. I've got two questions. One is more housekeeping. Can you give us some idea of the JanSport and Licensed sports revenue by quarter for last year, so we can really model this properly?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yeah. So we gave you the quarter and the full year in the table and we've said it's $0.03 to $0.04 per quarter from an earnings standpoint. So while I guess we didn't break out exactly the by quarter, you can assume based on that that it's fairly evenly spread through the balance of the year.

Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. And then I mean – and then secondly, I mean, I guess my question is, is with the U.S., the sort of mature U.S. market for some of your larger brands. One, within your guidance for Jeanswear and in general, how many store closures domestically do you have built in to like the current guidance and the five-year guidance?
And then secondly, what gives you the confidence that the European influence will move appropriately to the U.S.? I mean, what direction – are you sure it's going that way? Or is it just that the international businesses are less developed, started? Like the Timberland business overseas doesn't have the reliance on the Classic boot. How do you get a gauge on what's pushing what which direction, I guess?
Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.
Yes. I'll start with the kind of the numbers side of that question, Sam. So we're not going to get into the specifics of what we've put in or what's in, what's out. But just generally, just to reorient the comments I made earlier. We're really not expecting in the five-year plan any net wholesale growth in the U.S.
And within that we will see growth for sure, but we know it's going to be choppy. We may have a year where we see a little growth. Then we may see continued bankruptcies. And we're sure that's going to happen. We have modeled it behind the scenes. But that's not – for reasons I think you can appreciate, that's not something that we're going to talk about, what we're assuming on some of our customers in a public forum.
Just know that again when you think about where is our growth going to come from? It's going to come from our D2C, our digital, and that includes our digital partners as well, and our international wholesale. That's what's driving the next five years from our standpoint.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Yes. Sam, we absolutely see further consolidation here in the U.S. market. And really we've built our plans with that in mind. And to Scott's point, that net neutral number wholesale here in the U.S. market.
The comment around Europe and the influence that we see from our international business, it's not necessarily style or designs that we have in those marketplaces. It's more the discipline around thoughtful segmentation, elevated product, really strong experiential marketing within our own environments and our wholesale partners, and the way our leadership teams, in specifically Europe, are driving the business in a very methodical, professional way. It's those disciplines and the need to elevate product, our focus around design and innovation, and what that means to product and brand experience, that's what I'd ask you to take away.
And those disciplines being utilized across our business. It's the disciplines that sit within our Vans North America business here. It's one of the reasons they're so successful in putting together quarter after quarter positive results. It's taking that discipline, making sure it's well placed in each of our large brands, and just having the disciplined conversations to give us confidence in the long term sustainability of our growth.
But this is – to be honest with you, Sam, this is one of the reasons we made management changes, is to really get that leadership in place. The movement of Arne to our U.S. business, just bringing that focus, that leadership presence to these key brands gives us confidence that everything we've been talking about from a longer-term standpoint is absolutely within our line of sight.
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thanks. And one last thing. I mean with The North Face brand, when you talk so much about all the technical attributes. There was an earlier question regarding some of the different technologies that you've had over the years and what you have.

I mean how much of this is technology related? And how much of it is style related? I mean if your stuff looks good and keeps you warm and protects you and breathes appropriately, isn't that sort of expected? And then the changing of styling and compelling other people to buy new stuff, is this technology – and I've read this in the notes about other companies. Is this technology the icing or the cake when it comes to the brand?
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
Wow, Sam, that's a question at a guy who really loves technology. So I'll have to be careful about how I manage this answer.
It's both. It's style first. We know that when a consumer walks into a store, they notice color, followed by style. That brings you over to look at the product. And then how you interact with it is where your – again some of the style components of the quality of the material. Can I understand what the technology is in the garment? Is it relevant to my needs?
It's why we have moved to this consumer focused business unit approach, is having more of a clear understanding across those four brand territories of what the consumer needs are. Style and function, equally balanced, and really having the discipline of building thoughtful collections for each of the channels of distribution. So we can put the very best designed product with all of the right features and functions out there. So that when you do use the product, that it performs to the highest level of expectation. But at the same time you feel good and look good in that product. So it's really a balance of both
Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you very much and good luck.
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.

And that is all the time we have for questions. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Rendle for any additional or closing comments
Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.
So thank you, everybody, for joining us. We're excited to share with you how we've begun the year. I hope what you take away is our growth drivers remain very much intact. And our three largest brands, delivering against expectation, and in some cases doing a little bit better. Our D2C and digital platforms performing well. And international continuing to deliver strong results.
And all of that balanced with our fundamentals, as we look to improve how we operate, the gross margin expansion that's giving us the confidence and the fuel to invest behind our strategic choices, as we pivot to become more consumer and retail centric. And really giving us a much more agile and efficient approach to our go-to-market. So thank you. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Good day everyone. Welcome to the VF Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I’ll turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Joe Alkire. Please go ahead, sir.
Joe Alkire
Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be in adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.
You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.
During the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Contemporary Brands businesses as held for sale, and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.
Joining me on today's call will be VF's President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?
Steven E. Rendle
Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. The pace of change in both our industry and the broader consumer landscape continues to happen at accelerated rate. 2017 is the year of making transformational moves as we begin to evolve VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric in everything we do.
Six months into the first year of our 2021 strategy, our results are right in line with our expectations, and in fact, we’re doing so much better than we anticipated. Our improved performance in the face of an unpredictable retail environment around the world demonstrates the strength of our brand portfolio and diversified value creation model. We're in the early phases of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization and we are encouraged by our strong start to 2017.

During the second quarter, revenue increased 3% which was slightly ahead of our expectations as core growth engines continued to accelerate. Our big three brands, Vans, The North Face and Timberland, grew at a combined rate of 7%. Our international business grew 6%, including 18% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer grew 14% and our digital business was up more than 35% and growth accelerated to 8% in Workwear.
Our digital wholesale accounts, a key growth driver for VF over the next five years also increased at a high single-digit rate through the first half of 2017. Gross margin improved 160 basis points, an exceptional performance which again exceeded our expectations. 
VF's brands are strong. We remain disciplined in our renewed focus on elevating our creative capabilities, specifically in product design to enrich consumers brand experience, coupled with stronger marketplace management, is driving more profitable growth and further strengthening our brand equity.
EPS was $0.29 in the quarter at the high-end of the range we guided to in April. We also repurchased an incremental $200 million of stock which when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash returns to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. Strengthening total shareholder return remains a top priority.
As we look to the second half of 2017, we are gaining momentum across key dimensions of our business, and we see several catalysts on the horizon to ignite accelerated growth and value creation in our core growth engines.
As a result, we are raising our full-year 2017 revenue outlook to $11.65 billion based on stronger-than-expected growth in our Outdoor & Action sports business most notably Vans and The North Face brands, D2C and Workwear.
Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter we are raising our gross margin guidance now to 49.8%. Our strong gross margin performance is a central element of our diversified value creation model. It provides us the flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.
In light of our increased revenue growth in gross margin expectations, we are investing an additional $40 million or $0.08 per share in 2017 to amplify our momentum and fuel accelerated growth as we move into 2018. Our 2017 EPS outlook is now $2.94, which reflects the high-end of our previous outlook and includes the incremental investment just mentioned.
Earlier this year, I said that VF is a value creation company and some wondered what that meant. This quarter's results begin to provide evidence of our commitment to value creation. We're in the business of creating catalysts through our strong portfolio of diverse global brands. We will continue to reshape our portfolio and accelerate growth, and while we expect the retail landscape to remain uncertain, we will invest against our largest growth opportunities to create momentum rather than wait for it.
With that, let's review our second quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands, Workwear and Sportswear. Starting with The North Face brand. Global revenue increased 6% driven by a 26% increase in Europe, and a 1% growth in both the Americas and Asia.
Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong results from our D2C business, which increased at a mid-teen rate. Wholesale was relatively flat for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas, which didn't really start to impact us into the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North face increased at a high single-digit rate.
For the first half of 2017, global revenue for The North Face increased 7% or 9% excluding the impact of bankruptcies just mentioned. By region, revenue growth in the Americas was driven by mid-teen growth in D2C with strong results from digital, which grew more than 40% in the quarter. This was partially offset by a high single-digit decrease in wholesale due in large part to the impact of bankruptcies. 

Turning to product performance. The success of the Apex Flex jacket continued with Outside magazine naming it one of the best summer jackets of 2017.
And we can't forget to mention The North Face Athlete Alex Honnold, who made climbing history when he completed the first free-solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. I’m not if sure everyone can appreciate just how remarkable the steep was. A 3,000 foot granite wall in less than four hours, climbing alone and without safety gear with only his shoes, shorts, and chalk bag. The mental and physical strength required are beyond comprehension. Alex your passion encouraged, an inspiration to us all. Thank you for being the perfect embodiment of The North Face spirit of exploration.
In Europe, consumer demand for North Face brand remains very strong across the region. Our wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 40% and D2C grew at a high single-digit rate. The brand has tremendous momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Based on the forward-looking visibility we have into our order books as well as broad-based strength across key product categories in markets, we expect more than 15% growth for the balance of 2017.
In Asia, second quarter revenue sequentially improved as high teen growth in D2C was partially offset by an expected high teen decline in wholesale. From a product standpoint, outdoor training launched on April 1 with more than 40% sell-through, supported by the I Train For marketing campaign across the region and the opening of the first global outdoor training station in Shanghai.
Our urban exploration territory also continues to perform very well in Asia, providing consumers an opportunity to experience the brand new use occasions. While the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, and we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace, we expect accelerated growth in the second half of 2017, including mid single-digit growth in the third quarter.
There is no change to our mid single-digit growth expectation for The North Face brand in 2017. That being said, based on our strong first half performance, current order book visibility, and increased confidence for the balance of the year, we now expect growth to be at the higher end of that mid single-digit range.
Regarding the shape of our second half performance, fewer off-price sales and a significant shift in the timing of our order books from September to October, which Scott will touch on later, will likely result in a mid single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. Normalizing for the timing shift, however, revenue growth for the third quarter would be in the low to mid single-digit range.
Now to our largest and fastest-growing brand, Vans. Global revenue was up 9% with 7% growth in the Americas, 5% growth in Europe, and 29% growth in Asia. From a channel perspective, D2C increased more than 25% with 45% growth in our digital business. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate.
In the Americas, our D2C business remained strong with more than 20% growth in the quarter, including over 25% growth in digital and high teen comp growth. Wholesale declined at a mid single-digit rate pressured primarily by conditions in the family channel where we are in the midst of a product transition and up against strong distribution gains a year-ago. Based on current visibility as well as a significant momentum we have in the business, we now expect low double-digit growth in the Americas in 2017.
Vans brand growth extends across multiple product categories and families. While the Old Skool has recently become the number one classic style, the iconic slip on and checkerboard styles and designs are seeing tremendous growth, up more than 65% in the quarter, targeting the core skate community, the new athlete inspired UltraRange Pro was recently launched and at a $90 price point, saw real strength in the market with more than 70% sell-through in skate and board sport accounts.

Vans product collaborations have always been incredibly popular with consumers and the [indiscernible] Co-Lab was no exception. And last, but not least, our powerful customs platform which blends the experiential with the transactional increased at a triple digit rate and is the only -- and is only beginning to tap its full potential in the market as we add functionality each month.
In Europe, the Vans business is performing better than expected, as demand continues to accelerate. Our D2C performance was exceptional with more than 20% growth driven by more than 40% increase in digital and 20% comp growth. In line with the expectations, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate due to the timing of shipments.
Based on stronger-than-expected second half orders, we now expect our Vans Europe business to increase at a low double-digit rate for 2017, including strong high teen growth in the second half of this year.
In Asia, our Vans business is firing on all cylinders delivering almost 30% growth, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth in the region. Results during the quarter were powered by 45% growth in D2C with strength across all markets, including almost 80% growth in digital, in China.
Looking to our outlook for 2017, we now expect global revenue growth for Vans to be at the high-end of our low double-digit growth range. As expected, Timberland return to growth in the second quarter as global revenue increased 3% in line with our low single-digit growth outlook for the year. Growth was nicely balanced with a mid single-digit increase in D2C, and a low single-digit increase in wholesale.
Timberland brand revenue in the Americas increased 4% with high single-digit growth in D2C, including 25% growth in digital and low single-digit growth in wholesale. Our non-classics business increased at a low double-digit rate during the quarter with more than 100% growth in our new platforms, including SensorFlex and AeroCore.
Our Timberland PRO business also remained very strong with more than 20% growth. Our growth strategy is gaining traction as we work to diversify in North America business toward a more balanced assortment. The strong sell-through we are seeing with our non-classics products gives us confidence, we can drive accelerated growth in the second half of 2017 and into next year.
In Europe, Timberland brand revenue was up 4% in the second quarter driven by low double-digit growth in D2C, partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale. Growth across the region is strong and broad-based with more than 35% growth in our new platforms such as SensorFlex and AeroCore and high single-digit growth in apparel. Our European business has good momentum and is expected to deliver high single-digit growth in the second half of 2017.
Timberland's Asia business improved sequentially, but was down 1% as D2C declined at a low single-digit rate and wholesale was in line with last year. High single-digit comp growth, including more than 50% growth in digital revenue was offset by our strategic decision to close underperforming doors in some of our more mature markets. At the same time, our new footwear plus D2C concept is performing well across the region and we continue to achieve scale and significant momentum in China as revenue increased an impressive 60%.
Regarding the shape of our second half performance similar to The North Face brand, a significant shift in the timing of our order books will likely result in a low single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. However, when normalizing for the timing shift, revenue growth for the third quarter will likely be in the low single-digit range. There's no change to our low single-digit growth outlook for Timberland brand in 2017.

Moving to the Wrangler brand, as expected, global revenue for the second quarter was down 2%. D2C increased at a low double-digit rate, but was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas declined 2%, while revenue in Europe increased 5% and Asia which represents less than 3% of global brand revenue declined at a low double-digit rate for the quarter, primarily because of the continuing demand weakness in India primarily related to fiscal policy changes.
As we outlined in April, our U.S business continues to be impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and channel consolidation. And while our forward visibility remains low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is difficult to predict, we do believe we're on track to return to moderate growth in the second half of this year, most notably in the fourth quarter. And we’re seeing strong growth with our digital wholesale partners and in our own wrangler.com business.
Our efforts to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail are showing early signs of success. From a product perspective, the 70th anniversary Retro Glory collection continues to attract new and existing consumers with strong sell-through globally, and to wrap up the Wrangler brand, our outdoor line is performing very well.
Now to the Lee brand. Revenue declined 6% with 25% growth in D2C offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was down 9%, as ongoing channel weakness and consolidations, as well as difficult market conditions in our women's product more than offset solid performance in our men's business. Xtreme Comfort khakis and Extreme Motion Denim are clearly resonating with the male Lee consumer.
Lee Europe was down 4%, as low single-digit growth in D2C was offset by a mid single-digit decline in wholesale. In Asia, revenue declined slightly as mid single-digit growth in China was offset by ongoing weakness in India. Our women's business in China increased at a double-digit rate powered by our BODY OPTIX and Jade Fusion innovations, which should drive improved performance in the second half of 2017.
Turning now to Imagewear. Revenue was up 12% in the quarter due in part to LSG jersey sales. As part of the transition agreement with Fanatics, which acquired our licensing business early this year, we will supply jerseys for one-year following the transaction.
Excluding the impact of LSG jersey revenue, our Image business was up 2% and consistent with our growing optimism about our Workwear platform, which includes our Image business as well as our Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS workwear, revenue growth accelerated to 8% in the quarter with at least 20% growth in three of our largest brands, Timberland PRO, Bulwark, and Wrangler RIGGS workwear.
We are very bullish on the Workwear space and are clearly advantaged owner in our highest return on capital business. In addition to the macro tailwinds we see forming, we have a unique opportunity to drive accelerated growth and value creation in a highly fragmented market. We will accelerate growth by leveraging our expertise, capabilities, and platforms with some of the strongest brands in the sector.
With this solid performance and favorable outlook, we now expect Image revenue to increase at a mid single-digit rate in 2017, excluding the LSG jersey business and up from our previous estimate of a low single-digit rate increase.
Looking at Sportswear. Revenue is showing signs of stabilization and profit has improved. Congratulations to our new management team, which is beginning to make progress in a difficult environment.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.

A - Scott A. Roe
Thanks, Steve. Our second quarter results were right in line with our expectations and came in at the high-end of the range we communicated back in April. Revenue growth accelerated to 3% during the quarter, driven by strong results from our core growth engines. Our big three brands were up 7% on a combined basis, led by strength in Vans and The North Face brands, which grew 9% and 6%, respectively.
As expected, Timberland delivered 3% growth in the quarter and our Workwear businesses increased 8% collectively, with Timberland PRO, Bulwark and Wrangler RIGGS, all achieving at least 20% growth.
Our international business grew 6% with consistent growth across all three regions. China remains our fastest-growing market, generating 18% growth and we were particularly encouraged to see that our direct-to-consumer business was up 14% including more than 35% growth in our digital business. That's even more impressive when you consider that our store count is down from the prior quarter and our growth rate accelerated.
Our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved high teen D2C growth during the quarter. Our D2C business has significant momentum as we head into the second half of the year, but more on that in a minute.
Consistent with our expectations, wholesale revenue declined 2% primarily due to the channel pressures in our Jeanswear North American business, which as -- which we previously discussed. International delivered low single-digit growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a high single-digit rate through the first half.
Gross margin remained strong at 49.7%, up 80 basis points which includes an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. That is 160 basis point increase currency neutral and better than our prior expectations.
As we discussed, we remain sharply focused on fundamentals even at the expense of a little bit of revenue growth in the near-term. First half gross margins of 49.9% were up 180 basis points currency neutral. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of the diversified value creation model that provides us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.
SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 210 basis points to 42.6% in the quarter. To address a question likely on your mind, let me take a few minutes and provide more context around the shape of our expense and investment profile this year. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the lowest volume quarter of the year, so our SG&A ratios are always a little distorted.
While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we are making deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities, D2C and in particular digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, through the first half, our investment in these areas account for more than all of the SG&A increase versus last year, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.
As we told you in Boston, at our Investor Day, we’ve made the strategic decision in 2017 to begin investing now rather than wait for our anticipated growth acceleration in the second half. In fact, we've committed an additional $40 million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year. Our investments will accelerate growth as we move into 2018 and it's to our advantage to move quickly and take the offensive [ph].
Our brands are strong and in a marketplace that continues to experience significant disruption, we believe we have a unique investment and growth opportunity when many of our competitors are on their heels. So putting this all together, this means that we expect SG&A to deleverage through the first three quarters of this year. As our growth accelerates in the fourth quarter and we began to realize the benefit of our agility and cost optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in SG&A in the second half and into 2018.

Second quarter operating margin declined 130 basis points to 7.1% including a 70 basis point negative impact from changes in FX, as well as the growth investments just mentioned. So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS of $0.29 was in line with prior-year on a currency neutral basis.
Turning to the balance sheet, our inventory increased 3% slightly less than our second half growth expectation. During the quarter, we repurchased about $760 million of stock bringing our total share repurchase to 1.2 billion so far this year. That's $200 million higher than our previous expectation and when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash return to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. That’s an 8% cash flow yield based on our current market cap.
The first half was in line with or slightly better than we expected, based on the momentum we have in our business and the additional investments we're making to fuel accelerated growth, we are raising our outlook for the full-year.
Our updated 2017 outlook now includes the following: reported revenue is expected to be up 2% or 3% on a currency neutral basis to $11.65 billion. This compares to our previous expectation of low single-digit increase. Our increased revenue outlook is driven by strength in Outdoor & Action Sports, particularly Vans and The North Face, increased expectation for D2C most notably digital and higher growth from our Workwear businesses.
Gross margin is now expected to improve about 40 basis points to 49.8%, which still includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX. This represents a 20 basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of 49.6%. Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis including about a 60 basis point negative impact from changes in FX.
EPS is now expected to be $2.94, down 1% on a reported basis, but up at a mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. Our outlook now includes $0.08 per share or $40 million pre-tax impact from additional investments to fuel accelerated growth into 2018. As a reminder, our prior EPS outlook was a range of $2.89 to $2.94.
Now let me provide a few comments regarding the shape of our second half. As it relates to the third quarter, which has historically represented the peak for fall shipments, we’ve seen a significant shift in order book timing from the end of September to early October, simply put as consumers by a closer to need, our key retail partners are setting their floors later which pushes our shipments from what has traditionally been Q3 and to Q4.
And while we have visibility to the orders, the shift has pushed almost $100 million of wholesale revenue into Q4 compared to a year-ago. As a result, we expect revenue growth in the third quarter to be in the low single-digit range and EPS to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.12. Normalizing for the wholesale timing shift, our revenue and EPS growth rate for Q3 would be in the mid single-digit range.
Some with the first half behind us, we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have good momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth, our gross margin is strong, our fundamentals are intact, and we are investing in our future growth drivers.
And as Steve mentioned, given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan, we're putting more investment behind our largest brands and growth platforms and returning more cash to shareholders. We will create momentum, not wait for it.
If you take away one thing from our comments, I hope that one thing is confidence. Confidence in our outlook, confidence in our brands and our people, and confidence in our strategy.
I’m going to close by addressing the topic I know is top of mind for many investors, the M&A environment. As you recall, reshaping our portfolio is the number one choice in our 2021 strategy. We are committed to active portfolio management. As we’ve said, we believe we are a value creation company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and the activity has increased over the past few months, and we continue to evaluate the shape of our existing portfolio. We look forward to keeping you updated our progress.

With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we will open the call for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will have our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.
Robert Drbul
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Steven E. Rendle
Good morning, Bob.
Scott A. Roe
Good morning, Bob.
Robert Drbul
I guess, the two questions, the first one is more on when you look at the third quarter expectation in some of the detail, on like the order book or the changes in the order book, have there been any material changes to the total number or it's just a shift into the third or the timing of it? And the second question that I have is, around the Jeanswear business, can you just give us an update on the transition its underway? Is there really a site line to stabilization in the Jeanswear business where the profit pressures are pretty significant?
Scott A. Roe
So Bob, I will take the first part of that. First of all, our visibility versus what you guys can see is really what we tried to bridge here, right. We -- there is really no change in what we see for the full-year relative to the order books. It's -- we’re just talking about a little bit of a shift in timing. And just to put that in perspective, we are literally talking about a couple weeks. But that's the difference between Q3 and Q4. So, absolutely no change in the big picture. Just a little bit of timing between Q3 and Q4. That's why we tried to zoom out and say if you look at the second half, it's kind of in that mid single-digit range and normalizing, but you’re going to see a little of noise when you compare to last year when you specifically look at just the third quarter.
Steven E. Rendle
And Bob your Jeanswear question, really there is little new news and little change to what we’ve talked about in the past. The big room -- big picture remains the same, but our visibility is not great and we expect variability as we continue through the year though. We do see a line of sight to an uptick coming back in the fourth quarter. And it's important to remember, in our Jeanswear business our international business continues to be strong, especially in China where we see our Lee women's business continue to grow at double-digit great growth rates behind the two innovations, Body Optix and Jade Fusion. I think once we get through the destocking phase, velocity will increase and that's where I think, we, VF really comes into play and our ability to respond quickly with the strength of our supply chain and the quality of our team that works on that business not to be able to really read and react quickly to be back -- right back in the game.
Robert Drbul
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.
Lindsay Drucker Mann
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. With respect to your cold weather businesses, specifically North Face, but also Timberland, is your view that you’re retail partners have ordered to reasonable end demand for a normal cold-weather season or are we in a stage here where they’re ordering very, very tight and looking to chase, and have you based your orders on what you're pulling in terms of inventory, in terms of their orders, or have you put yourself in a position where you have excess inventory in order to chase into that demand?
Steven E. Rendle
Yes. Hi, Lindsay. This is Steve. I would characterize the outdoor specialty in even more broadly, the Outdoor Community as buying very tight, with -- two years in a row, multi-years where we’ve seen variable winters. Retailers are playing it very close to the best. They’re investing behind those brands, that have momentum and bringing those truly innovative products. Our inventory, we -- as you know, we buy to our order book with a real thoughtful amount of reorder around key styles within each of these brands. I would tell you where the strength sits for us. It's in the performance of our D2C and you saw in this quarter where our comps are strong, our digital is exceptional, and I really would put that behind -- the marketplace is clean. And we're sitting in an environment where -- it's to the rest of the year. We're not -- our ability to chase is limited from a wholesale and probably where if as we see momentum in digital and D2C. That's really our opportunity from -- if strong trends continue. 

Lindsay Drucker Mann
Got it. And Scott, could you just walk through the drivers of the gross margin improvement in the quarter? I know you talked about FX, but anything specific to channel shift, direct versus wholesale, cost, pricing, etcetera to break down the change that we saw in the quarter would be helpful?
Scott A. Roe
Yes, sure. So there is about 80 basis points of negative impact from FX. I think it was in the prepared remarks. So that means about 160 currency neutral. That mix has been really consistent at that 50 to 60 basis points, and we saw the mix come in through, that's our D2C, digital, international businesses being strong. Remember also we talked in February about the shape of cost, right. So cost through the first half is a tailwind to us. It turns to a little bit of headwind in the second half. For the full-year, it's really not much of a factor. So we're seeing a little bit of benefit now that will turn negative in the second half and -- but really not a huge factor like I said. And then, the other thing is honestly just better fundamentals. We’ve reduced our off-price sales. We’re focused on -- not bringing excess inventory into the channel and we're seeing more full price sell-through along with better D2C and digital. Those things are all pretty virtuous from a gross margin standpoint.
Lindsay Drucker Mann
Great. Thanks so much.
Scott A. Roe
Thank you.
Operator
We will go next to Michael Binetti, UBS.
Michael Binetti
Congrats on a nice quarter. I want to ask you about the $40 million in incremental investment. Obviously, we just went through -- the big five-year outlook with an investment plan there, and so now we’ve got $40 million on top of it. I just want to ask at a high-level, as you think about that, what are some of the areas that you're seeing? Is it more recent stuff that you’ve seen as an opportunity, you decided to dial-up $40 million or is it just extending things from the Analyst Day and then -- obviously, how do you think about the payback on dialing that up, as you’ve already gave an initial plan? How does that $40 million flow-through to your earnings outlook, maybe in the [indiscernible]?
Steven E. Rendle
Yes, Michael. This is Steve. So, really it's based on our confidence. As we look at where we are year-to-date and what we -- line of sight to what we have for the balance of year, we just have confidence in what we'd like to do, and what we've chosen to do is thoughtfully invest behind a select number of our strategic choices that we outlined in Boston to get us moving into 2018 where we talked about maintaining and building continued momentum. So about a quarter of that $40 million is going against demand creation within our big three brands in D2C and digital. We expect that to have an impact this year and into next year, but half is around specific strategic priorities. Design and innovation, data and analytics, our digital platform, absolutely continuing to move on advanced manufacturing and innovation projects we have in play there and then talent. Talent really is the great driver for us long-term and we are continuing to look at acquiring as well as developing key talent to help us grow long-term.
Michael Binetti
Got it. And then, on North Face specifically, I think the one thing we heard coming out of the Analyst Day was, I think we’ve some new leadership there. So maybe there would be some more -- more material update to the strategy after the Analyst Day. I would love to check in on that, how you guys are feeling about innovation for the year and then also just a little bit more on some of the strength you're seeing in Europe? Where is that coming from? It's been several quarters now of very, very big growth above what you see across, I guess, a lot of the channels in Europe from other companies. So I’d love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that business?

Scott A. Roe
Yes, and I would love to talk about that. I think you remember, in Boston, we introduced you to Arne Arens, who at that point had been the leader of our European business and we are moving him to be the GM of the Americas business. He has since been appointed the President of the Global North Face business and just bringing that, that strong leadership presence and vision that he had in Europe to our total global business. And you just really see that in very short order, the confidence, that -- now sits within that broader North Face team, the clarity of focus against their strategy and you’re starting to see the momentum in our D2C business, specifically. I will answer your point on what -- as we think about year and innovation. The Apex Flex jacket, which came out in the spring was a really good beginning to seeing new products move into the marketplace. This fall you're going to see dramatically updated Summit Series collection and there is a jacket in their called the Ventrix, that we're very excited about that not only plays into the Tier 1 aspect of the marketplace, but also into our -- into some of the broader market partners. We also see some new ski lines coming in conjunction with the focus on mountain sports. And then urban exploration, more of that North Face lifestyle presentation that just gets us into a broader set of usage occasions. I think what you see going on in Europe, really is a much tighter focus. If you remember couple of years ago, we went through a reset there as well and Arne led the -- the return to growth through a much, much more focused integrated marketplace management and significant segmentation tailoring and merchandising line, specifically to wholesale partners as well as our own D2C. And as that momentum builds, you’re seeing those results not only in our first half, but in our expectation of getting that mid teen growth through the balance of 2017. So this speaks to the benefit of quality leadership, clarity of vision, and focusing on creating products and brand experiences that consumers can be drawn into.
Michael Binetti
I guess, just to follow that really quickly, is -- we can see as it go through your stores, in the U.S now some of the bigger ones starting to get segmented harder between the four different North Face segments. Is the thinking that we can really follow that similar road map has driven such nice growth rates in Europe. In U.S., I guess, as you pull back on some of the wholesale doors, in the U.S., you can -- you still think there is pretty good growth rates ahead for the North Face as you start pushing out similar segmentation strategy here in the D2C side?
Scott A. Roe
We absolutely do, Michael. I mean, I think you remember at Boston we talked about a brand that would grow, 6% to 8% on a five-year CAGR. We just raised our guidance this year to the high-end of our mid single, which is at the low-end of that 6% to 8% growth CAGR that we posted for the five-year. So we have great confidence. Just move into these four specific brand territories, just allows our product team and the marketing team to focus on these key usage occasions for our core consumer. Speaking to the core consumer, but also attracting new consumers and you see that in Europe, you see that in Asia, and we have great confidence that that will absolutely work here in the domestic market.
Michael Binetti
Okay. Thanks a lot, Scott.
Operator
We will go next to Camilo Lyon, Canaccord Genuity.
Camilo Lyon
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. How are you?
Steven E. Rendle
Hey, Camilo.
Camilo Lyon
I was hoping you could speak a little bit about your endeavors around accelerating your speed [ph] to market capabilities and where do you see -- which brands you see the most opportunity and that impacting the P&L, first to last I think that’s clearly a function that you guys are working hard to have and already achieved in, but I’m curious to know where your thoughts on how you can really leverage that to your benefit so you can expect more from your D2C goals across the brand?

Steven E. Rendle
Right. What we talked a little about this Camilo in Boston, and it's a foundational element of our new five-year strategy. It's one of those key choices around transforming to be more consumer and retail centric. And what we’re looking at there is really the end-to-end process of product creation and everything to do with going to market. We've got a number of projects underway with our largest brands, where we’re really tearing down the timelines of product creation, as well as manufacturing and looking at where can we take time out, how can we use digital technology to advance our ability to be more agile. But it's also true, the integrated marketplace strategy, segmentation, and merchandising very specific collections to the distribution choice and building really well articulated -- well merchandised collections and flowing them in a more relevant and consistent way. So moving away from this old wholesale model, that you’ve seen so many people do over the years to being present more often through more thoughtfully merchandised lines and its challenging every aspect of our product creation cycle. Our supply chain is deeply involved in this project and really helping shepherd how our product creation teams are looking at this, and how they can be more integrated in thoughtful, in improving our speed to market.
Camilo Lyon
Does it right to think that North Face maybe the brand that feels the benefits of the first as you layer on the innovation that you’re talking about, [indiscernible] of your four categories and how you’re improving the global process?
Steven E. Rendle
The North Face is certainly one of those brands, that’s deep into the work. And I think each one of our big brands will benefit, but to your point specifically yes, The North Face will benefit being -- thinking through the lens of four specific territories, across each of the regions into each of the specific channels. When you can focus on doing fewer things better, the results typically are always very positive.
Camilo Lyon
And then, Scott, since you brought it up, I was just curious to get your latest thoughts on if your hunting ground for acquisition has changed or has evolved, I would assume that the discussion, well -- tell me if the discussions have changed to become a little bit more fluid with respect to valuations and if that’s -- if there's been a closer dialog with respect to the [indiscernible] grounds of where buyers and sellers [indiscernible]?
Scott A. Roe
Well, I guess, I’d answer it this way, Camilo. One of the nice byproducts of the disruption and carnage in our sector is the fact that valuations are coming a little bit our way and given our strong balance sheet the cash that we generate, that puts us as an advantaged acquirer in the space. So valuation as I try to say is only one component of the equation, right. And it has to be, first of all, the right brand, the right space, and something that we’re an advantaged owner to make it -- make sense. But given that, valuation is always going to be a key component and valuations in general are moving our directions. So I would say it's a slightly more favorable environment compared to say the last 12 the 24 months.
Camilo Lyon
And then for your hunting ground, is that -- it used to be, if I recall correctly, you’re focused on the Outdoor & Action Sports face, footwear was a key category that you’ve been looking at, is that evolve?
Steven E. Rendle
Yes, Camilo. This is Steve. I'll take that. If you remember back in Boston, I stated pretty clearly that, I’d really like the external world to not think of us as an Outdoor & Action Sports company, but as a value creation company. That is deeply informed by our understanding of our core consumer, anchored in our powerful brands and certainly a center of gravity sitting in Outdoor & Action Sports, but it's less about really the -- the sector and it's more about the consumer usage occasions. And where can we find a way to bring our skills and capabilities and the benefits of our platforms to bear it to unlock these new pools of value. The number one choice in our integrated strategy is reshaping our portfolio and we are extremely committed to doing just that in aligning our portfolio to be consistent with our financial aspirations.

Camilo Lyon
Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.
Operator
We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.
Laurent Vasilescu
Good morning and congrats on the continued momentum in the business. I want to follow up on the incremental investment. In terms of the $0.08 impact, how should we think about it between 3Q and 4Q? And can we potentially further parse out in basis points the SG&A deleverage anticipated for the third quarter versus the leverage expected for the fourth quarter?
Scott A. Roe
Good morning, Laurent. I would expect a question like that as you're building that massive model. The -- we haven't really shaped it, but Steve made a comment and some of that is in the second quarter. You saw some of that incremental investment. We even got going in the second quarter and it's relatively balanced through the third and fourth. This is the way I would answer that. So the -- and from a gross margin standpoint, we've talked to you about the full-year, you know with the first half is, you can assume that's fairly linear through the back half. So I think that gives you the pieces to shape the second half of the year and model it out reasonably well.
Laurent Vasilescu
Okay. Super helpful. And then a non-modeling question. A number of key vendors like Nike and Ralph Lauren have recently outlined efforts to edit this. Can you count going forward? Your March Investor Day, I think the term editing the portfolio with you several times, so aside from any potential divestitures or acquisitions, are there any internal processes you may be putting in place around [indiscernible] assortment to further drive the gross margin over time?
Steven E. Rendle
Yes. Laurent, that is real key to the transformation project that I answer just a little bit ago. As you think about integrated marketplace and what's the correct number of SKUs in each of the specific deliveries to be agile and relevant to our consumer, editing SKUs to amplify, stronger product is a key part of that. I don't have any specific metrics that I would share with you today, but it is central to how we’re thinking about editing to amplify and becoming much more agile with how we come to market across each of our big brands.
Laurent Vasilescu
Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in. Shipping out the $100 million shift from 3Q and 4Q, can we expect the wholesale business to be roughly a flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter, especially as you lap last year's U.S bankruptcies?
Scott A. Roe
Yes, that -- that's a reasonable assumption. You'll see relative -- you will see the strongest wholesale growth for the year in the fourth quarter for the reasons that you mentioned also we are lapping -- we have the bankruptcy impact [indiscernible] and we're also starting to lap the destocking activities in the fourth quarter.
Laurent Vasilescu
Super helpful. Best of luck.
Scott A. Roe
Yes, one other thing just to add on that too, don't forget Vans Europe really is returning back to growth. We talked about that order book being in the double-digit range in the second half. So that’s a third factor.
Operator
We will have our next question from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.
Dana Telsey
Good morning everyone and congratulations on the improved results. As you think of the digital wholesale business and the growth that you’re seeing there, how do you think about your strategy with the Amazon's in the world -- of the world? And then, your thinking about D2C, which seems to have accelerated. What are your plans with store openings and closing in the different regions? Thank you.
Steven E. Rendle
So Dana I will start here. So how we -- I think it's more about how do we think about really those the digital wholesale partners that we have across the globe. And there's major pure plays. There's also key customers that we've been with for years and they are part of that integrated marketplace that have choices that we have and they’re very important part. We talked about that in Boston, that our digital wholesale partners is a significant part of our growth in the next five years. Amazon is an important customer. And just we have -- some of our brands that have 1P relationships, we have some brands that have 3P relationships and we have some brands that have chosen to continue to look at and measure just how they could successfully work with Amazon more importantly here in the U.S marketplace long-term. I think it's fair to say, you will see The North Face open up a 3P partnership and have a trial going into fall '17 or you might even want to call that a pilot as we look at how to integrate Amazon into the long-term integrated marketplace strategy for The North Face here in the United States. We are working with Amazon in Europe and we will look at how we can do that here. But I’d remind you there's a number of great players around the globe, AliBaba's, Orlando [ph], all of those are key wholesale partners for us long-term.

Dana Telsey
Thank you. And on the direct-to-consumer piece on the retail stores part?
Scott A. Roe
Yes, maybe I'll start with a little bit of that. Dana, first of all, good morning. So we talked about the fact that our store count actually was down very modestly versus the last quarter. And that the reason to highlight that is just to pay off the fact that we said we're serious about looking at our portfolio from a profitability standpoint. We're really focused on improving the performance of and editing our underperforming stores and focusing on those formats and brands which are very successful. So you'll see that even if it costs us a little top line, we're willing to be -- we are willing to take those actions and that really is a pay off against that. Having said that, we're really committed to brick-and-mortar stores going forward, because we think that's part of that integrated marketplace that Steve mentioned. That's the highest and 10 ultimate experience of our brands and we see that is a critical component to the overall picture. So we talked about 50 net store openings this year, and you can expect something similar to that going forward according to our long range plan.
Dana Telsey
Thank you.
Steven E. Rendle
You bet. Thank you, Dana.
Operator
We will go next to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.
Matthew Boss
Thanks. So on gross margin is it still fair to think about 40 to 50 basis points of underlying expansion from mix just on an annual basis? And if so, can you just walk through the drivers? And then separately on SG&A, I guess, given your comments earlier should we expect expenses to grow below the pace of sales as we move into next year and beyond?
Scott A. Roe
Yes. So first of all gross margin, yes, you're right in that zone. I mean our mix is a little ahead of our long-term rate. But we’ve said that 40 to 50 basis points should be sustainable and it's pretty simple. Our highest margin businesses are fastest-growing. That's been true and we expect that to continue to be true, that being our international business are our digital and our D2C in general plus Outdoor & Action Sports are big three brands, have higher gross margins in the total. So that mix we expect to continue. I will just remind you of kind of the formula, right. Our gross margins expand, we are investing from an SG&A standpoint in those strategic drivers and then looking for leverage as we talk about platforms across [indiscernible] if looking for leverage and all other expenses. And that’s how this formula works together. So as it relates to SG&A, we will continue to invest in SG&A. Over time that's going to be below our margin expansion. We talked about in our 2021 plan, our operating margin will expand over the next five years. But let's be clear, we are going to continue to invest around as growth drivers particularly D2C and specifically digital underneath that.
Matthew Boss
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
We will go next to Sam poser, Susquehanna.
Samuel Poser
Good. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I’ve got a couple. Can you clarify the change in your currency neutral revenue guidance between what you had prior and what you’re giving now?
Scott A. Roe
Yes. I will start. Hey, Sam. Its Scott. So, yes, we said last time low single-digit currency neutral and reported with 2 points of currency, so that obviously if you do the math, that’s about 1%. And now we're raising that to about 2%, at a $11.65 million. So that's how we get from and to and we've given you a very specific revenue target at $11.6 5 million.
Samuel Poser
So your currency impact is the same just you’re raising the numbers?
Scott A. Roe
Well, there is some currency benefit. If we think about what's happened in the currency markets, our largest exposure is the euro and it's a little favorable. Our second largest is the pound, which is very unfavorable. But when you net that together, there is some benefit from a currency standpoint, although not significant.

Samuel Poser
Okay. And then -- two other just housekeeping. Most of the questions have been answered. The tax rate you’re looking for the full-year and the share count, what's built into the share count for the -- in this guidance?
Scott A. Roe
Yes, so what we -- we don't give you the share count per se, but we talked about $1.2 billion of buybacks, so I guess the math can be done. As it relates to the tax rate, we said about 20%. And that’s consistent with what we said in our last guidance.
Samuel Poser
Well, thank you very much and good luck.
Steven E. Rendle
Thanks, Sam.
Scott A. Roe
Thanks, Sam.
Operator
We will go next to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.
Erinn Murphy
Great. Thanks. [Technical difficulty]
Steven E. Rendle
Yes. Hi, Erinn. Its Steve. So I think what we see going on there, we put a new leadership team in place there in January. Brendan, brought a really strong understanding of retail. One of the areas we wanted to quickly shore up was our outlook business and that's really around productivity and how we're really converting the traffic that comes in our doors. Concurrently with that, we -- last year continue to look at our product offering and evolving that to be -- to allow us in the same idea of integrated marketplace, have -- specific products for each of our different channels of distribution. And I see -- I think what you see happening this year is what we have going on in the department store is relevant to that consumer. It's different than what you have in our outlet stores and online. And I think just with a more focused assortment and in a slightly cleaner marketplace, we're seeing that drop to our profitability as we continue to look to reignite sales. I really don't have a line of sight to what the balance of the year. Otherwise we’re going to continue to do more of the same and bring relevant third and fourth quarter styles through this to the lens of the Nautica heritage, that we've seen working really well. And again just these assortment specific to each of the channels, which is new to some of the things that we've done in the past.
Erinn Murphy
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
We will go next to Kate McShane, Citi Research.
Kate McShane
Thanks for taking my question. With regards to the operating margins for Jeanswear specifically, can you help us understand the mechanics of the operating margin during the quarter and for the rest of the year how much of it has to do with the destocking and how much is Apex related?
Scott A. Roe
Sure. I will take it, Kate. Good morning. So first of all, there's a few dynamics that are going on in the profitability. First, regarding margin. We’ve made a strategic decision to put more innovation and more make into the channel as an offensive move. But it's at a time when pricing is difficult. So that has put pressure on our margins in the short-term. We think that's the right move. Remember the big picture here, right. We are going through a disruptive phase, but we're really targeting and focused on when we come out of this, right. We’re trying to position ourselves to be the strongest brand standing at the end of this process. And as a result, we decided from a short-term profitability standpoint we'd make that strategic decision. The other side of that is again we're playing really to win in the long-term. So we've maintained our demand creation investments through this difficult period. We could have easily made a different decision, which would have helped us from a short-term profitability, but we think again for the same reasons the smart move here is to play for the long game and for the endpoint. And so we’re going to see tough margins through this year and really those same drivers that I just mentioned that we're seeing in the first half. You will see those themes continuing into the second half.

Steven E. Rendle
And Kate, I would add to that, why we made the decision to maintain our demand creation is we see our specialty business specifically the Western category, Wrangler RIGGS, but also mentioned the 70 Retro Style, as we look to open up the lens of our Wrangler brand and open it up to a broader set of channels. We're seeing really nice traction taking hold in some of these new points of sale in the moving up the distribution channel and we think it's important to continue to invest behind the brand to assure that that continues to go.
Kate McShane
Thank you.
Steven E. Rendle
Thank you, Kate.
Scott A. Roe
Okay.
Operator
Our last question will come from Jim Duffy, Stifel.
Jim Duffy
Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hope you’re doing well.
Steven E. Rendle
Hey, good morning, Jim.
Jim Duffy
Couple questions for me. You mentioned that the visibility on the Jeanswear business is difficult. Is the destocking headwind behind you at this point in the Jeanswear category?
Scott A. Roe
No, Jim, it's not behind us. It's progressing and just [indiscernible] the shape. The reason we say, we kind of know the endpoint here, right. We know where the floors are going to end up when we say lack of visibility we don't control the pace of markdowns as the floor is cleared, and that can have a really big impact on our sell-through depending on what's on sale, how deep those discounts are etcetera. So the quarter-to-quarter cadence is going to be a little hard for us to project, but when you step back and say there's only so many -- so much inventory in the floor to be cleared and we know where the endpoint is, you kind of know the goalpost, you’re just not sure exactly what happens in between.
Jim Duffy
Fair enough. And then building on that, you did a nice job managing the inventories. Can you talk about some of the things you are doing to keep inventory tightened? How it is that you’re better managing the amount of off-price across all the brands, not just specific to Jeanswear?
Scott A. Roe
Yes, I guess, I would say it started with the fact that I think from -- we decided to play it a little on the conservative side, right. We didn't build excess inventory. We are -- we gave guidance. It's in the low end of the range and we said we're willing to walk a little bit of revenue in order to improve the dynamics in the marketplace. So we're not building the field of dreams, right. We're not building inventory in a hope that we will get it. We are not -- we are trying to hold back a little bit and match order books closer to the conservative position. And we've seen over time that that type of action will pay off in the long run. It hurts us a little bit in the short-term from the top line and short-term earnings, but for the long-term brand health and long-term growth, history has proven that's the right -- the place we want to be.
Jim Duffy
Okay, good. And then my last question. The sales model for some of the other businesses beyond Jeanswear have historically offered better visibility. In the U.S wholesale channel, are your partners giving you a better baseline of visibility to plan the business or you just still feel there's a fair amount of uncertainty as they try to get their arms around their own fundamentals?
Steven E. Rendle
You know, Jim, I think -- here in the U.S I think the wholesale community is playing things very, very tight to the West [ph] and rightfully so. The marketplace is transforming and the historical ways of ordering are needing to change and that's really central to how we’re thinking about our transformation agenda, how we're -- being much more diligent around the integrated marketplace understanding our channel partners. What's the space that we have to place product in, what's the frequency required to really be present and incent consumers to come in and interact with us either in our own stores or wholesale. So I think things are tightening up and they should for all of us be, I think, more in tune with what our consumers are asking us for. This notion of transforming is a really important aspect.

Jim Duffy
Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Steven E. Rendle
You bet.
Scott A. Roe
Okay, Jim.
Steven E. Rendle
Thank you, Jim.
Operator
That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Steven Rendle for additional or closing remarks.
Steven E. Rendle
Great. Yes, thank you everybody. I just want to reiterate, we are in the early stages of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization. And we're encouraged with where we are at the start of 2017, but I would just remind us all that we're at the beginning of this journey. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth. Our gross margins are improving and then our fundamental business disciplines are very, very intact. We are choosing to thoughtfully invest in our future growth and the confidence we have year-to-date has us moving more quickly against our design and innovation agenda, driving demand creation, but also looking at some of the core platforms of advanced analytics, advanced manufacturing, and specifically talent. We are focused on creating momentum against our five year's objectives and we look forward to interacting with you in the future as this -- the strategy unfolds. So thank you.

REPORT





 VF’s CEO Steven Rendle to succeed Eric Wiseman as Chairman





Prachi Singh |



Monday, July 24 2017	




VF Corporation’s executive chairman and director Eric C. Wiseman has
decided to retire effective October 28, 2017. VF’s board of directors has
elected President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Steven E. Rendle,
to the role of Chairman effective upon Wiseman’s retirement. The company
said, Wiseman’s retirement completes VF’s planned leadership succession,
which began with the promotion of Rendle to president and chief operating
officer in June 2015, and to CEO in January of this year.
“Now is the right time to take this final step in our leadership
succession plan,” Wiseman said in a statement, adding, “With credit to our
board of directors, the plan and its implementation have proven successful.
Steve’s transition to CEO has gone smoothly, and just as he was the right
person to serve as VF’s next CEO, Steve is the right person to now serve as
our chairman of the Board.”
VF’s chairman Eric Wiseman to retire in October
“Succession planning at the highest levels of VF’s senior leadership
team is a key component of the company’s long-term success, a
responsibility the board takes very seriously,” said Alan McCollough, Lead
Independent Director of VF’s Board of Directors in a media release, adding,
“The decision to select Steve as Chairman was made following a thorough
evaluation of the required skill and leadership capabilities necessary to
fuel the company’s continued global growth.”
The company said, Wiseman began his career with VF in 1995 when he
joined the company as executive vice president of the JanSport business. He
then held a progression of leadership roles, including chairman of VF's
sportswear and outdoor coalitions and executive vice president, Global
Brands. He was named president and chief operating officer in 2006, and
elected to VF's board of directors that same year. Wiseman was named CEO in
January 2008 and chairman of the Board in August 2008.
“Eric is a proven leader and throughout his career he has inspired
others to excellence. His success has always been guided by values that are
core to who he is, including respect, integrity, determination and grit.
During his time as VF’s chairman and CEO, Eric helped to successfully guide
the company through the great recession and its aftermath, and he grew VF’s
business presence around the world. And, it’s especially noteworthy that
during Eric’s time as CEO the company’s share price more than tripled,”
added Rendle.

Desigual H1 sales decline 9.6 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Desigual performance in the first half of 2017, the company said, was
hampered by a drop in multi-brand distribution network and company-owned
store sales. Desigual reported revenue of 377.9 million euros (442 million
dollars), down 9.6 percent on H1 2016, including a decline of 8.5 percent
in Q2 2017.
The company said, H1 decline stems primarily from a decrease in
wholesale orders in the multi-brand distribution network for the
spring/summer collection, following poor sales of previous collections; and
a drop in company-owned store revenue, mainly due to the ongoing
rationalization plan.
Desigual expects winter/fall 2017 collection to track the spring/summer
collection. The company, however, reported healthy performance in the
digital segment, with double-digit sales growth. The digital segment
currently accounts for 11 percent of revenue. H1 2017 EBITDA amounted to
54.6 million euros (63.9 million dollars), down 23.6 percent on last year.
This decline, the company said, mainly reflects a slowdown in activity,
despite the positive impacts of the management strategic plan, which should
continue in coming periods.

Adidas says Q2 revenues improved 19 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


For the second quarter, Adidas said that revenues from the
company’s continuing operations increased 19 percent on a currency-neutral
basis and 20 percent in euro terms to 5 billion euros (5.8 billion
dollars). The company said, operating profit increased 18 percent to 505
million euros (590 million dollars) driven by a higher gross margin as well
as operating expense leverage. Net income from continuing operations
increased 16 percent to 347 million euros (405 million dollars) during the
quarter.
Adidas said, as previously announced, due to the existence of signed
agreements to divest the TaylorMade, Adams Golf, Ashworth and CCM Hockey
brands, the results from these businesses are reported as discontinued
operations. In the second quarter, the TaylorMade and CCM Hockey
divestitures had a non-operational negative impact on discontinued
operations of around 200 million euros (234 million dollars). However, the
company’s continuing operations, which now mainly consist of the Adidas and
the Reebok brand, were not affected.
Adidas updates FY17 outlook
Due to the strong first half year performance, the company has increased
its 2017 financial outlook. Management now projects currency-neutral sales
to grow at a rate between 17 percent and 19 percent against previous
forecast of increase by between 12 percent and 14 percent compared to the
adjusted 2016 net sales of 18.483 billion euros (21.646 billion dollars)
for the company’s continuing operations).
Furthermore, the company forecasts a year-over-year gross margin
improvement during the second half and expects to continue to generate
operating leverage throughout the remainder of the year. As a result, net
income from continuing operations is now forecasted to increase at a rate
between 26 percent and 28 percent in 2017 to a level between 1.360 billion
euros (1.592 billion dollars) and 1.390 billion euros (1.627 billion
dollars). This compares to the original guidance as provided in March of an
increase of between 13 percent and 15 percent to a level between 1.200
billion euros (1.405 billion dollars) and 1.225 billion euros (1.434
billion dollars) for the company’s net income from continuing
operations.

Sports Direct increases stake in French Connection to 27 percent




Angela Gonzalez-Rodriguez |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct now owns a 27 percent stake in troubled
fashion retailer French Connection after buying shares from Gatemore
Capital and OTK, two of the fashion chain’s activist investors. 
As reported Thursday, Gatemore Capital and OTK, which held 8 percent and
7 percent stakes in French Connection respectively, have sold their entire
holdings in the business after trying to drive change in the fashion
retailer – even giving the CEO an ultimatum.
Activist investors gave up on trying to make French Connection’s CEO
change his mind
 “French Connection could have unlocked significantly more value during
the period had it made more progress in fixing its corporate governance.
French Connection remains a glaring example of the shortcomings of the UK
Corporate Governance Code: namely, that companies can get away with such
violations with zero repercussions to the people at the top,” Liad Meidar
managing partner at Gatemore told ‘The Telegraph’. 
After increasing its stake, Sports Direct has got closer than anyone
else to the 30 percent minimum stake required by law to trigger a takeover
bid. Actually, the sports apparel chain has enhanced its stake in the
fashion retailer’s equity from the 11 percent it first purchased last
February to this 27 percent. 
Back in June, Gatemore and OTK joined forces and demanded French
Connection’s CEO Stephen Marks to step down and consider other
opportunities to turnaround the business, even a sale. 
It’s worth recalling that Marks owns a 42 percent in the company and
that this the 
fifth consecutive year of losses for French Connection, which
widened its losses from 3.5 million to 5.3million pounds last year.

Deckers Brands posts Q1 sales growth of 20.3 percent




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


First quarter net sales at Deckers Brands increased 20.3 percent to
209.7 million dollars compared to 174.4 million dollars for the same period
last year. The year-over-year increase, the company said, was primarily due
to earlier than planned global wholesale shipments, an increase in
direct-to-consumer (DTC) comparable sales, and stronger than expected sales
in the Hoka One One brand. On a constant currency basis, net sales
increased 21.5 percent.
“Our first quarter results reflect solid consumer demand for our spring
product offering across our brands combined with earlier than planned
shipments of certain fall orders,” commented Dave Powers, President and CEO
in a statement, adding, “While it is still early in the year, we are
encouraged by our recent top-line performance.”
First quarter financial review
UGG brand net sales for the quarter increased 24.9 percent to 114.7
million dollars and on a constant currency basis, sales increased 26.6
percent.
Hoka One One brand net sales increased 74.2 percent to 30.7 million
dollars compared to 17.6 million dollars for the same period last year. On
a constant currency basis, sales increased 75.3 percent. Teva brand net
sales increased 8.6 percent to 37.7 million dollars, while on a constant
currency basis, sales increased 9.8 percent.
Sanuk brand net sales were 26.2 million dollars compared to 26.7 million
dollars for the same period last year, a decrease of 2 percent on both a
reported and constant currency basis driven by the transfer of a retail
store to a partner at the end of the last fiscal year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 43.2 percent compared to 43.7 percent
for the same period last year. The company added that gross margin was
slightly better than expected, and included an 80 basis point headwind from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Operating loss was 56.3 million dollars compared to 78.3 million dollars
for the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating loss was 54.3 million
dollars. Diluted loss per share was 1.32 dollars compared to 1.84 dollars
for the same period last year, while non-GAAP diluted loss per share was
1.28 dollars.
Sales performance by channel and geography
Wholesale net sales for the first quarter increased 24.5 percent to
144.6 million dollars and on a constant currency basis, sales increased
25.1 percent. DTC net sales increased 11.8 percent to 65.1 million dollars,
on a constant currency basis, sales increased 14.3 percent. DTC comparable
sales for the quarter increased 12.7 percent over the same period last
year.
Domestic net sales increased 10.2 percent to 120.7 million dollars
compared to 109.5 million dollars for the same period last year.
International net sales increased 37.2 percent to 89 million dollars
compared to 64.9 million dollars for the same period last year. On a
constant currency basis, sales increased 40.8 percent.
 Fiscal 2018 outlook reflect decline to flat sales growth
The company said, net sales are expected to be in the range of down 2
percent to flat and gross margin to be approximately 47.5 percent. Non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 3.95 dollars
to 4.15 dollars, which excludes any charges that may occur from additional
store closures, restructuring and other charges.
The company expects second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales to be down
approximately 10 percent versus the same period last year, primarily as a
result of store closures, and the earlier than planned shipments in the
first quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be
approximately 1 dollar to 1.05 dollars compared to 1.23 dollars for the
same period last year.

Columbia Sportswear: Q2 net loss widens to 0.17 dollar per share




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 28 2017 


Columbia Sportswear Company announced second-quarter net sales of 398.9
million dollars, a 3 percent increase compared with the second quarter of
2016. Net loss totalled 11.5 million dollars or 0.17 dollar per share
compared to second quarter 2016 net loss of 8.2 million dollars or 0.12
dollar per share. For the first six months of 2017, the company’s net sales
grew 28.8 million dollars or 3 percent (4 percent constant-currency),
to 942.7 million dollars, while net income increased 4 percent, to 24.5
million dollars or 0.35 dollar per diluted share compared to 23.6 million
dollars or 0.33 dollar per diluted share.
Commenting on the results, President and CEO Tim Boyle said in a press
release: "We delivered solid first half financial results featuring growth
from three of our four brands and all four geographic regions. We have
embarked on ‘Project Connect’ from a position of strength, including a
current outlook that anticipates sales and earnings growth and a fortress
balance sheet with more than 600 million dollars in cash and no long-term
debt."
Financial highlights of the second quarter
Second quarter consolidated net sales increased 3 percent, driven by 4
percent net sales growth in the US to 238.2 million dollars, consisting of
mid-teen percentage growth in direct-to-consumer net sales, partially
offset by a high-single-digit percentage decline in wholesale net sales; 14
percent net sales growth in the EMEA region (16 percent constant-currency),
to 67.3 million dollars, including growth in net sales to EMEA distributors
and in the company's Europe-direct business; and 2 percent net sales growth
in Canada (5 percent constant-currency), to 13.9 million dollars. 
The sales growth, the company said, was partially offset by a 9 percent
net sales decline in the LAAP region (8 percent constant-currency), to 79.5
million dollars, primarily due to lower net sales in China and Korea.
Global Columbia brand net sales increased 2 percent (3 percent
constant-currency) to 340.5 million dollars, while Global Sorel brand net
sales increased 71 percent (74 percent constant-currency) to 6 million
dollars. Global prAna brand net sales increased 9 percent to 35 million
dollars and Global Mountain Hardwear brand net sales decreased 5 percent
to 16.1 million dollars.
Global apparel, accessories and equipment net sales increased 3 percent
to 329.7 million dollars, while global footwear net sales increased 3
percent (4 percent constant-currency) to 69.2 million dollars.
Second quarter loss from operations totalled 17.3 million dollars, or
(4.4) percent of net sales compared to 11.8 million dollars or 3 percent of
net sales, for the same period in 2016. Second quarter net loss
totalled 11.5 million dollars or 0.17 dollar per share compared with second
quarter 2016 net loss of 8.2 million dollars or 0.12 dollar per share.
The board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend
of 0.18 dollar per share, payable on August 31, 2017 to shareholders of
record on August 17, 2017.
Columbia Sportswear updates FY17 outlook
The company currently expects 2017 net sales growth of approximately 3
percent compared with 2016 net sales of 2.38 billion dollars, including
less than 1 percentage point negative effect from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. The company's US direct-to-consumer channel is
expected to account for a majority of the projected full year 2017 global
net sales increase.
The company expects gross margins to improve by approximately 30 basis
points and operating income to increase approximately 3 percent, to
between 256 million dollars and 265 million dollars, resulting in
anticipated 2017 operating margin of approximately 10.8 percent. Net income
after non-controlling interest is expected to increase up to 4 percent to
between approximately 193 million dollars and 200 million dollars, or
approximately 2.74 dollars to 2.84 dollars per diluted share.

Benneton Group doubles annual losses to 81 mn euros




Prachi Singh |



Wednesday, July 26 2017 


Benetton Group has not been able to recover from losses since last two
years and the trend continued in 2016 as well. The Italian group reported a
loss of 81 million euros (94 million dollars) against 46 million euros (53
million dollars), the company posted last year, says a Modaes report.
The company's sales declined 8 percent to 1.38 billion euros (1.60
billion dollars), which Benetton attributed to continued economic
stagnation in Europe and decline in sales of indirect sales channels as
well as poor performance of stores in Italy, France, Germany, Poland and
Turkey. However, the company believes that its ongoing transformation plan
will make a partial impact in 2017 but will manifest fully from the
spring-summer 2018, the report adds quoting a accounts filed by Edizione, which
controls 100 percent of Benetton Group.
As a part of its reorganization efforts, Benetton hired Marco
Airoldi as the new CEO in April 2014. It also closed over 300 stores and
currently operates around 5,000 stores. The company has also focussed its
energies on its two core brands - United Colors of Benetton and Sisley to
bring the company back into the black.

VF Corp invests 40 million USD to accelerate business growth




Vivian Hendriksz |



Tuesday, July 25 2017 



London - US retail group VF Corporation remans confident about its future -
so confident that it is set to invest an additional 40 million USD in its
business to fuel and accelerate its growth for 2018.


The announcement comes after VF Corp published strong results for its
second quarter, which surpassed analyst expectations. “We have really good
momentum as we move into the second half of 2017 and are confident in our
growth engines, as evidenced by an increase in our full year outlook and
our plan to increase our cash returns to shareholders,” said Steve Rendle,
President and Chief Executive Officer of VF Corp in a statement.


“Based on the strength of the first half of 2017 and our expectations for
the second half of the year, we are making
growth-focused investments in our largest brands and platforms to generate
additional value for our shareholders both in the near and long term.” VF
Corp aims to continue investigating what its largest growth opportunities
will be to create more momentum within its businesses. At the moment VF
Corp is currently focusing on streamlining its store portfolio by closing
stores which do not achieve full profitability, according to an interview
with WWD.


However, VF Corp is also set to open another 50 stores for the company’s
three biggest brands, Vans, Timberland and The North Face, as part of the
company’s five-year strategic plan, previously unveiled this March.
Improving VF Corp portfolio remains a key part of the company’s five-year
plan. “We think there are plenty of opportunities in the marketplace. We
are very active in that process,” said Rendle.

REPORT





 VF’s CEO Steven Rendle to succeed Eric Wiseman as Chairman





Prachi Singh |



Monday, July 24 2017	




VF Corporation’s executive chairman and director Eric C. Wiseman has
decided to retire effective October 28, 2017. VF’s board of directors has
elected President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Steven E. Rendle,
to the role of Chairman effective upon Wiseman’s retirement. The company
said, Wiseman’s retirement completes VF’s planned leadership succession,
which began with the promotion of Rendle to president and chief operating
officer in June 2015, and to CEO in January of this year.
“Now is the right time to take this final step in our leadership
succession plan,” Wiseman said in a statement, adding, “With credit to our
board of directors, the plan and its implementation have proven successful.
Steve’s transition to CEO has gone smoothly, and just as he was the right
person to serve as VF’s next CEO, Steve is the right person to now serve as
our chairman of the Board.”
VF’s chairman Eric Wiseman to retire in October
“Succession planning at the highest levels of VF’s senior leadership
team is a key component of the company’s long-term success, a
responsibility the board takes very seriously,” said Alan McCollough, Lead
Independent Director of VF’s Board of Directors in a media release, adding,
“The decision to select Steve as Chairman was made following a thorough
evaluation of the required skill and leadership capabilities necessary to
fuel the company’s continued global growth.”
The company said, Wiseman began his career with VF in 1995 when he
joined the company as executive vice president of the JanSport business. He
then held a progression of leadership roles, including chairman of VF's
sportswear and outdoor coalitions and executive vice president, Global
Brands. He was named president and chief operating officer in 2006, and
elected to VF's board of directors that same year. Wiseman was named CEO in
January 2008 and chairman of the Board in August 2008.
“Eric is a proven leader and throughout his career he has inspired
others to excellence. His success has always been guided by values that are
core to who he is, including respect, integrity, determination and grit.
During his time as VF’s chairman and CEO, Eric helped to successfully guide
the company through the great recession and its aftermath, and he grew VF’s
business presence around the world. And, it’s especially noteworthy that
during Eric’s time as CEO the company’s share price more than tripled,”
added Rendle.
