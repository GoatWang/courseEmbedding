Why Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. Stock Soared Today
The critical systems and subsystems supplier delivered a great quarter. Here's what investors need to know.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Apr 27, 2017 at 2:47PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Ultra Clean Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT) were up 12.7% as of 1:45 p.m. EDT after the critical subsystems and turnkey solutions designer announced stronger-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results. 
So what
Quarterly revenue climbed 82.3% year over year, to $204.6 million, and translated to adjusted net income of $15.9 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, up from an adjusted net loss of $0.1 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis in last year's first quarter. By comparison, analysts' consensus estimates called for lower adjusted net income of $0.42 per share on revenue of just $192.6 million.


IMAGE SOURCE: ULTRA CLEAN HOLDINGS.


According to Ultra Clean Holdings CEO Jim Scholhamer:

Disciplined and focused execution by the UCT team enabled us to outperform for the fifth consecutive quarter. During this period of extraordinary semiconductor equipment demand, we have consistently responded and quickly ramped our operations, allowing us to meet our customers' needs and be a vital contributor to their success. We continue to increase UCT's presence on our customers' product platforms and are expanding our opportunities for future growth. 






Now what
For the second quarter, Ultra Clean expects revenue of between $210 million and $220 million and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.49 to $0.55. Here again, both ranges were well above Wall Street's estimates for second-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $183.3 million.
In the end, this is a cut-and-dried case of Ultra Clean Holdings exceeding expectations and following through with encouraging guidance. And it's no surprise to see Ultra Clean Holdings' stock up big today as a result.

Interesting UCTT Put And Call Options For December 15th
Investors in Ultra Clean Holdings Inc saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.11      Net Money Flow ($)  348,578    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
