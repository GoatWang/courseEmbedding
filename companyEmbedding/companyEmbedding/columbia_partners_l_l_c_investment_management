2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Equity Strategies



Our Philosophy
We believe that owning the very best stocks is essential to creating wealth. Our experienced team of equity analysts and portfolio managers is dedicated to and focused on finding these companies. We are investors not traders and our time horizon for investing is of a longer-term nature.
Equity Strategy
Our strategy in managing stocks focuses on the selection of securities that we believe will outperform the broader markets.
We employ a well-defined, established process for security selection in each of our equity strategies. Each process is unique, focused and repeatable and results in the discovery of companies that meet our strict criteria for selection and inclusion in our portfolios. Our analysis requires that each security that is selected endure a rigorous analytical assessment that is both quantitative and qualitative.
Our analysis requires that each security that is selected endure a rigorous analytical assessment that is both quantitative and qualitative
We initially perform a detailed assessment of each security under consideration. We develop an investment thesis and establish price targets for each selected security. We then initiate a portfolio position, or in the case of an existing holding, decide to add to, reduce or eliminate a portfolio position. Once a security is selected, our analysis is ongoing, and new information may result in a price target being revised either up or down.
Our selection process also focuses on the quality of a company, from both the perspective of its financials and its management. We believe that in the volatile markets that we have experienced in recent history that high quality companies will prevail and outperform over the long term.
We believe our process is an iterative cycle for each security and that the discipline associated with the continual analysis and reevaluation of new and existing securities will result in superior returns for our clients’ portfolios.
We manage a number of different portfolio strategies for our clients, including Large Cap, Large Cap Growth, Small-Mid Cap Growth, Small Cap Core and Small Cap Growth.

Intermediate Fixed Income Investment Management | Columbia Partners, L.L.C. Investment Management

Home  »Fixed Income Strategies  » Intermediate Fixed Income






Intermediate Fixed Income



Our Intermediate fixed income portfolios seek to provide consistent returns and the stability afforded by focusing on high quality securities. We believe in achieving the highest returns from a portfolio of fixed income securities through:

Sector allocations.
Active management of the portfolio’s average duration and maturity distribution in anticipation of changes in interest rates.
Individual security selection to capture relative value.

Our process is consistent with an absolute commitment to a conservative approach. We avoid excessive risk and do not reach for extra yield. A well-diversified and high-quality portfolio has allowed us to add incremental value in normal market environments and perform exceedingly well in more difficult times.
Our fixed income portfolio approach:

We modify portfolio duration to protect principal or capture gains
We adjust maturities with expected changes in the shape of the yield curve
Sector weights are based on their relative risk/reward profile
Portfolios are invested in investment grade securities
We constantly review the credit outlook for portfolio holdings

We allocate assets to various sectors of the bond market—primarily governments, mortgages, corporate, and asset-backed securities—to provide the greatest risk-adjusted relative returns. Our intermediate fixed income portfolios hold approximately 100 securities.

Investment Focus




We strive to be excellent partners for private equity sponsors and management teams, providing patient and thoughtfully structured capital to high growth companies.
We seek investments in privately held companies with the following characteristics:

Company in mid to later stage of development — growth and/or expansion need for financing
Sophisticated financial and strategic sponsors already invested or committed to invest concurrently
Prefer to invest “high in the capital structure” via secured, structured or convertible debt but also will consider equity investments. Can be extremely flexible with terms and conditions to meet requirements of a compelling business plan
Up to 5 year investment period
Opportunity to invest $10 million to $30 million
Target industry sectors: communications, telecommunications,
media, and technology driven business services

We do not seek control investments. Control of our portfolio companies is typically in the hands of sophisticated institutional financial and strategic investors along with proven management. We will participate on boards when appropriate but do not require a board seat in order to invest. We typically require board observation rights. Notwithstanding the above, we are not passive investors and prefer investments where we can contribute value in the effort to guide companies toward profitable and timely exits.
Sponsor Funds
We consider our relationships with other private equity funds and their managers as an important resource for direct investment deal flow. It is crucial to the success of our direct investment strategy to be completely aligned with the equity investors in our portfolio companies. We view our capital as an attractive alternative to often very dilutive and disruptive late stage equity. This view is shared by our private equity partners who are typically the majority investors in our portfolio companies.

Small Cap Growth Equity



Our small cap growth equity portfolios seek consistent long-term growth of capital with reduced risk and volatility. We believe individual stock selection is the key to successful portfolio performance. The primary element of successful stock selection is the early identification of catalysts that will change investors’ views and opinions of the future prospects for individual companies.
Our strengths are our people and a disciplined and thoughtful investment approach. Skillful analysis, consistent application, and a clearly defined buy and sell discipline characterize our investment processes. A motivated and experienced team operating in an independent and supportive environment drives the process.
We seek to own companies with the following characteristics:

Strong revenue or predictable earnings growth outlooks
Positive earnings revisions
Superior returns on invested capital—generally the result of innovation, competitive advantage, and growing market share
Valuation premiums that are not excessive
Unique positions with identifiable market leadership
Strong, competitive, sustainable positions

We employ a bottom-up security selection process while having sector overweight/underweight guidelines. We hold between 60-70 securities and diversify by individual security, economic sector, and capitalization to reduce risk and volatility.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
