Investment Objective and Strategy


The Fund seeks to achieve capital preservation while producing positive returns with low volatility regardless of broad equity and debt market directions.
The Adviser seeks to achieve the Fund’s investment objective by investing the Fund’s assets in multiple exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and open-end mutual funds (collectively, the “underlying funds”) that pursue a number of traditional and non-traditional or “alternative” investment strategies. As such, the Fund is a “fund of funds.” The underlying funds also have the ability to pursue their own sector exposures and may invest in a broad range of securities, commodities and other financial instruments. The Fund’s multiple strategies and sectors approach seeks to provide greater overall returns with similar volatility when compared to the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index (“HFRX”).






	Learn more about the Value Line Defensive Strategies Fund, a fund-of-funds alternative solution that seeks to achieve positive absolute returns regardless of the market's direction.

 Our History 


 


*The Adviser, the Manager and EULAV Securities LLC, the Fund’s principal underwriter (the “Distributor”), have agreed to waive a portion of their management, advisory and, in the case of the Investor Class, Rule 12b-1 fees, and the Manager has further agreed to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, to the extent necessary to limit the total annual operating expenses of each class (other than those attributable to Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business) to a specified percentage of such class’s average daily net assets (the “Expense Limitation”). Pursuant to the Expense Limitation, the total annual operating expenses (subject to the specified exclusions) will be limited to the annualized rate of 1.45% and 1.20% of the average daily net assets attributable to Investor Class shares and Institutional Class shares, respectively. The Adviser, the Manager and the Distributor may subsequently recover the reimbursed expenses and/or waived fees from a particular class (within three years after the fiscal year end in which the waiver/reimbursement occurred) to the extent that such class’s expense ratio is less than the Expense Limitation. The Expense Limitation can be terminated or modified before June 30, 2017 only with the agreement of the Board of Trustees of the Value Line Funds Investment Trust (the “Trust”). The Fund's performance would be lower in the absence of such waivers.
†Morningstar™ Categories based on Institutional class shares.

The performance data quoted herein represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Market volatility can dramatically impact the fund's short term performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than figures shown. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Past performance data through the most recent month end is available at vlfunds.com or by calling 1-800-243-2729.

You should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Value Line Funds before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund's prospectus and summary prospectus, which can be obtained free of charge from your investment representative, by calling 800.243.2729, or by clicking on the applicable fund at www.vlfunds.com. Please read it carefully before you invest or send money. The inception dates of Value Line Mutual Funds range from 1950 to 2016. Value Line Funds are distributed by EULAV Securities LLC. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Portfolio holdings are subject to change and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell securities. Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to risk.

The average annual returns shown above are historical and reflect changes in share price, reinvested dividends and are net of expenses. Investment results and the principal value of an investment will vary.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three- year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Services.  EULAV also manages investment
companies and other accounts that use the rankings and recommendations the
Value Line Services. These accounts, as well as the officers, directors, and
employees of Value Line, may dispose of a security notwithstanding the fact
that The Value Line Investment Survey ("The Survey") ranks the issuer
favorably; conversely, such accounts or persons may purchase or hold a security
that is poorly ranked by The Survey. Some of the investment companies managed
by EULAV only hold securities with a specified minimum Timeliness Rank by the
Survey and dispose of those positions when the Timeliness Rank declines or is
suspended.  Additional rank-related

in a ranking. While the rankings in the Survey are intended to be predictive of
future relative performance of an issuer's securities, the Survey is not
intended to constitute a recommendation of any specific security. Any
investment decision with respect to any issuer covered by the Survey should be
made as part of a diversified portfolio of equity securities and in light of an
investor's particular investment objectives and circumstances.6 - Ownership of

                Harvey S. Katz, Mario Ferro, and Robert Harrington | 07/28/2017

The U.S. equity markets opened lower on Friday as traders weighed a disappointing earnings update in the tech sector with an encouraging advance in the initial second-quarter GDP reading. With roughly even market breadth as a backdrop, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ extended their Thursday losses early in the day. Though the afternoon saw each pare their respective losses intermittently, with a final-hour push from the bulls, the rallies lacked the staying power to instill a change in direction at the end of the day.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
