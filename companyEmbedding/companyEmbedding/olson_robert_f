Olson, Robert F. - The Wall Street Transcript













































 





































Robert F. Olson
ROBERT F. OLSON, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of
IntraNet Solutions, Inc., brings over 20 years of industry experience to
the company, including over 10 years’ experience in the electronic
publishing and document/content management industry. His vision for
leading IntraNet Solutions to a market dominant position in the business
content management market is supported by his strong entrepreneurial
background combined with a keen knowledge of operations, sales and
marketing. Mr. Olson is one of the industry’s earliest promoters of
electronic publishing applications in the US, and in the mid-1990s, Mr.
Olson was quick to capitalize on the technology shift from electronic
publishing to emerging Internet applications by founding IntraNet
Solutions, Inc., a Web content management provider. He led the company
in establishing a market presence for its first Web-based product
offering, and in 1999 he spearheaded the launch of Xpedio Content
Server, a new class of enterprise Web application software. Mr. Olson
established Technical Publishing Solutions, Inc. (TPSI), in 1990, the
predecessor to IntraNet Solutions, and grew the company to over $10
million in revenues within five years with customers such as 3M and
Honeywell.
