How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Papa, Christopher J carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Papa, Christopher J currently holds license 2101075432 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Papa, Christopher J



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

LPT Taps Papa as Executive Vice President, CFO
Alburger Retiring Post at Liberty While Post at Liberty to Begin Searching for Papa's Replacement
By Justin Sumner

Christopher J. Papa, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Post Properties, Inc.
Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LPT), an international developer, owner and manager of industrial and office product headquartered in Malvern, PA, has hired Christopher Papa as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective June 1, 2016. George J. Alburger, Jr., who currently holds the same position at LPT, will be retiring after staying on through the end of the year in an advisory capacity to assist with the transition.  Alburger served as the firm's CFO since 1995. Liberty CEO Bill Hankowsky said, "For two decades, George’s name has been synonymous with financial acumen and integrity.  His efforts have created our strong financial position, but equally important, his passion and integrity have been imprinted on Liberty’s culture." Papa currently serves as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Post Properties, Inc. (NYSE: PPS), a position he has held since 2003.  Papa will step down May 31st, and Post, a multifamily REIT, developer and operator headquartered in Atlanta, has immediately begun a search for his replacement.  In the meantime, Papa's responsibilities will be assumed by other members of his senior management team, including Arthur J. Quirk, who has served as chief accounting officer since 2001. Said David P. Stockert, Post’s CEO and president, "Chris has been an effective and valued member of the leadership team here at Post, and has been instrumental in shaping what is one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT sector. We all wish Chris every success with this new opportunity." While at Post, Papa was responsible for treasury and finance oversight, investor relations, accounting, tax, information technology, human resources and internal audit processes.  Before joining Post's corporate leadership team, Papa advised and served clients in the real estate, financial services, healthcare and manufacturing industries as audit partner at Arthur Andersen LLP and BDO Seidman LLP, and before that served as CFO of a privately-held manufacturing company. Papa is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), a member of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), Financial Executives International, the AICPA and the New York State Society of CPAs.  He holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from Clemson University. "Chris joins Liberty at an exciting time, when the transformative aspects of our portfolio repositioning strategy are just beginning to be realized," added Hankowsky.  "He brings to us a wealth of knowledge and relevant experience in our industry, and the entire Liberty team looks forward to working with him."

Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
