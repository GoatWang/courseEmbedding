In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

RBO & CO. | Investment Management Napa Valley



































































 































 


“Our focus at RBO is to partner with clients as their investment manager and to preserve and grow their capital through the consistent application of a disciplined investment methodology.” – Jack Oliver, Managing Partner


About RBO

 


RBO is an investment manager serving individuals, family offices, and institutions. We specialize in acquiring equity positions in publicly-traded companies with competitive advantages, exceptional leadership, and that we believe are significantly undervalued. Our dedication to long-term relationships and the consistent application of our investment approach have allowed us to protect and grow client capital for more than three decades.
As an independent Investment Advisor, we follow a commitment to honor and serve our clients, strive to be a symbol of integrity in the investment management business, and hold ourselves accountable to the highest measures of transparency. Our dedication to providing superior results for our clients has never wavered.

 



Key Elements of RBO’s Investment Approach

 



Independent Research

 


Independent research is the foundation of our investment approach and we believe a key differentiator from our peers. We believe in the importance of on-site company visits with senior management teams as well as the importance of analyzing competitors, customers, and suppliers.

 



Concentrated Portfolios

 


Diversification is important and we believe it can be effectively achieved by owning 20-30 companies across industries and geographies. By owning a limited number of companies, we invest only in our highest conviction ideas.

 



Long-Term Perspective

 


We believe the market frequently misprices stocks due to misinterpretation, inattention, emotion, and a short-term outlook. Because of our long-term horizon, we can think differently from the crowd and use these opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive valuations.

 



Global Exposure

 


Our portfolios are not bound by geographic constraints. We generally believe that we achieve international exposure by owning domestic companies with operations outside of the United States.

 



Minimized Costs

 


Since we view stocks as ownership stakes in businesses, we do not trade frequently in an attempt to generate short-term gains. By trading infrequently, RBO limits taxes and trading costs, two of the most common pitfalls of active managers.

 



Risk Management

 


We define risk as a permanent loss of capital and not by market volatility. We assess risk from both a qualitative and quantitative viewpoint by analyzing our investments one at a time, believing the best risk management method is by individual company analysis.

RBO & CO. |   Philosophy



































































 


































At RBO we manage portfolios with a single, unified investment philosophy. Utilizing a common sense investment approach, we seek out undervalued companies by conducting intensive fundamental research and investment due diligence.

 


Our investments generally meet these three criteria:

 


Competitively Advantaged

 


We invest in businesses that we believe possess distinct competitive advantages which include: high barriers to entry, limited competition, strong financial position, high returns on capital, and consistent and growing free cash flow generation. Historically we have found businesses with sustainable competitive advantages earn a disproportionate share of industry profits and investment returns.

 


Strong Management Teams

 


We seek able and proven management teams that can articulate and implement the required strategies to maintain competitive positioning. Management teams must also possess a shareholder-oriented mentality that includes returning excess capital to the owners of the business: the shareholders.

 


Undervalued Prices

 


We require entry prices that are considerably less than what we believe the companies are worth. We demand a “margin of safety” so that our client capital is protected against unforeseen risks. The degree of this discount is an integral factor in determining the amount of client capital allocated to a particular investment.

 







 
``Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike.``


-Benjamin Graham; The Intelligent Investor, 1949

 
“Every equity position is an investment in a business. We must understand the business, the financials, the management, the industry, and the competition.” – Josh Harrington, CFA, Director of Research

































RBO & CO. |   History



































































 



































Reginald B. Oliver founded RBO & Co. in 1980. Prior to founding RBO, Reg worked for 20 years at Pershing & Co. where he was the Director of Research and a Partner. While at Pershing, Reg spent a great deal of time visiting clients and management teams throughout the United States which he felt greatly enhanced his research process and investment perspective.
Reg built up the Pershing research department and mentored many analysts who became nationally recognized investment managers. His views, particularly those on the individual investor, were sought and reported in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and most notably on Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser.
A critical thinker and natural contrarian, Reg successfully combined his common sense investment approach with the philosophies of Ben Graham and David Dodd. Through primarily organic returns and a concentrated value investment methodology, Reg significantly grew his assets under management from RBO & Co.’s founding until his passing in 2005.

 

RBO’s investing roots began in 1881, when Jack's great-great-great-grandfather was a founding member of the Pacific Stock Exchange and later served as chairman. His great-grandfather led Letts-Oliver Investment Co., and his father founded RBO in 1980.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

RBO & CO. | Investment Management Napa Valley



































































 































 


“Our focus at RBO is to partner with clients as their investment manager and to preserve and grow their capital through the consistent application of a disciplined investment methodology.” – Jack Oliver, Managing Partner


About RBO

 


RBO is an investment manager serving individuals, family offices, and institutions. We specialize in acquiring equity positions in publicly-traded companies with competitive advantages, exceptional leadership, and that we believe are significantly undervalued. Our dedication to long-term relationships and the consistent application of our investment approach have allowed us to protect and grow client capital for more than three decades.
As an independent Investment Advisor, we follow a commitment to honor and serve our clients, strive to be a symbol of integrity in the investment management business, and hold ourselves accountable to the highest measures of transparency. Our dedication to providing superior results for our clients has never wavered.

 



Key Elements of RBO’s Investment Approach

 



Independent Research

 


Independent research is the foundation of our investment approach and we believe a key differentiator from our peers. We believe in the importance of on-site company visits with senior management teams as well as the importance of analyzing competitors, customers, and suppliers.

 



Concentrated Portfolios

 


Diversification is important and we believe it can be effectively achieved by owning 20-30 companies across industries and geographies. By owning a limited number of companies, we invest only in our highest conviction ideas.

 



Long-Term Perspective

 


We believe the market frequently misprices stocks due to misinterpretation, inattention, emotion, and a short-term outlook. Because of our long-term horizon, we can think differently from the crowd and use these opportunities to purchase businesses at attractive valuations.

 



Global Exposure

 


Our portfolios are not bound by geographic constraints. We generally believe that we achieve international exposure by owning domestic companies with operations outside of the United States.

 



Minimized Costs

 


Since we view stocks as ownership stakes in businesses, we do not trade frequently in an attempt to generate short-term gains. By trading infrequently, RBO limits taxes and trading costs, two of the most common pitfalls of active managers.

 



Risk Management

 


We define risk as a permanent loss of capital and not by market volatility. We assess risk from both a qualitative and quantitative viewpoint by analyzing our investments one at a time, believing the best risk management method is by individual company analysis.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
