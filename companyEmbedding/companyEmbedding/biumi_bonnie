        Sol Kerzner, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kerzner International Holdings Limited (the “Company”), which through its subsidiaries, is a leading international developer and operator of destination resorts, casinos and luxury hotels, is pleased to announce the promotion of Bonnie Biumi, Chief Financial Officer, to President of the Company.  Biumi will assume her new position immediately. 

Biumi, who has been with the company since 2007 has made significant contributions in the overall finance and accounting functions of the Company.  She will continue to report directly to Chief Executive Officer Sol Kerzner and will be based out of the Company’s Plantation, Florida, offices.

“It is a great pleasure to promote Bonnie, she has shown true leadership in navigating the financial landscape over the past 2 years and I know she will continue to be instrumental and successful in the growth and further development of the company,” said Sol Kerzner.

Biumi last served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCL).  During her time with NCL, Biumi was responsible for all aspects of financial management; corporate tax; treasury; investor relations; information technology; corporate, capital and strategic planning; and merger and acquisition activities.  Prior to this role, she worked for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.  Biumi began her career in public accounting at Price Waterhouse in Miami.  After deciding not to pursue a career in public accounting, Biumi accepted the role of Chief Financial Officer for People’s Telephone Company in 1994, and afterwards held the role of Chief Financial Officer for Neff Corporation in 1997, until joining Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in 1999.  

Kerzner International Holdings Limited, through its subsidiaries, is a leading international developer and operator of destination resorts, casinos and luxury hotels.  Kerzner’s flagship brand is Atlantis, which includes Atlantis, Paradise Island, a 2,317 room ocean-themed destination resort in The Bahamas, as well as The Cove Atlantis and The Reef Atlantis.  Kerzner extended its Atlantis brand globally with the development of Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, a 1,500-room, water-themed resort opened in late 2008 on The Palm, Jumeirah.  Kerzner’s most recent development is Mazagan Beach Resort, a 500-room destination casino resort in Morocco, which opened in October 2009.   Kerzner also manages six of the top-rated luxury resort properties in the world, under the One&Only brand, which are located in The Bahamas, Mexico, Mauritius, the Maldives, South Africa and Dubai.  One&Only The Palm, Dubai, will open in October 2010.  For more information concerning Kerzner and its operating subsidiaries, visit kerzner.com.
