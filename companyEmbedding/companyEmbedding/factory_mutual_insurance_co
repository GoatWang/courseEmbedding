Dan Chao is your Pleasant Hill GEICO Insurance Agent.
Hi, my name is Dan Chao and I'm your local GEICO Insurance Agent. I have more than 20 years' experience as an insurance agent in California, but I decided to become part of the GEICO family in 2009 after the great service and value I personally received from GEICO as a policyholder. I know the Bay Area well, and understand your needs to protect what's important to you.
I proudly support the San Francisco Chapter of Make a Wish Foundation, and The Bay Institute which protects and restores watersheds that drain into the San Francisco Bay. Are you into charity walks and runs? I invite you to stop by the GEICO tent for fun and refreshments at the Annual Walk for Wishes at Saint Mary's College, San Francisco Bay to Breakers and the Oakland Running Festival.
For our Spanish speaking customers, there are full-time Spanish-speaking staffers in the office. (Representantes que hablan español están disponibles en esta oficina.) 
How To Find The Pleasant Hill Office
We are conveniently located off Interstate 680 (Exit 49B) and Monument Boulevard in the Crossroads Shopping Center. Our office is found between the two shopping center entrances on Buskirk Avenue. Stop by or call us today!

Find a GEICO Insurance Agent serving San Francisco.
Ask a friend who's not from San Francisco what first comes to mind when they think of San Francisco, and it's likely they'd bring up fog, earthquakes, hills... and maybe Chinatown. But locals know there's more to the City by the Bay than meets the eye.
Your GEICO Insurance Agents in San Francisco know there's a lot more to the Bay Area than the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Lombard Street, and Silicon Valley. That's because they're your neighbors. They know where to find the best seafood in the city, where to shop for the best vintage clothes, even which routes to take to avoid the inevitable congestion on Highway 101.
Driving in San Francisco can get pretty crazy, but that doesn't mean shopping for insurance has to be crazy, too. Contact a San Francisco GEICO Insurance Agent for a free quote on auto, motorcycle, RV, homeowners, renters or condo insurance. Your local agents can help you customize a policy for your unique needs and help you save as much as possible off your premium.
When you get a quote, be sure to mention if you're a Military member stationed at USCG Air Station San Francisco or at another Military installation in Northern California—you could get a Military discount! Alumni of UC San Francisco, Golden Gate University, or the University of San Francisco could also qualify for a special discount.
Contact your San Francisco insurance agent and find out how much you could save.
Dan Chao is in Pleasant Hill on Monument Boulevard, in the Crossroads Shopping Center.
Marlon Zarate is in San Mateo on El Camino Real between the 92 Freeway and Downtown.

Find out how Marlon Zarate, your GEICO Insurance Agent in San Mateo, could help you save money on more than just your car insurance.

Hello, my name is Marlon Zarate. I have been an insurance agent for over 10 years, and I opened my local GEICO office in San Mateo in 2015.
From San Francisco to Mountain View, my office would be happy to help Peninsula area residents see how much they could save on more than just car insurance. Ask us about motorcycle insurance, boat insurance, ATV insurance, RV insurance, and more. We can also help with homeowners, renters, condo, or mobile home insurance.
My office will help you with any GEICO discounts you may qualify for, such as discounts for Military members or members of certain alumni or professional organizations.
For our Spanish-speaking customers, we have full-time Spanish-speaking agents in the office. Representantes que hablan español están disponibles en esta oficina. We also have licensed agents that speak Tagalog.
Our goal is to offer you the best possible coverage, at the most competitive price, with excellent customer service! Call today for a quote.
Spot Marlon and his team around the San Mateo community.
I enjoy giving back to the community by participating in local events and charities. I am an active member of the City of San Mateo Chamber of Commerce. I also participate in many of the Downtown San Mateo Association events, such as the Downtown Clean Up. Keep an eye out on our Facebook page for upcoming events and fun giveaways. You may even meet the Gecko!
Stop by the San Mateo GEICO office.
We are conveniently located on El Camino Real between the 92 Freeway and Downtown San Mateo. We'd love to meet you!

Dan Chao is your Pleasant Hill GEICO Insurance Agent.
Hi, my name is Dan Chao and I'm your local GEICO Insurance Agent. I have more than 20 years' experience as an insurance agent in California, but I decided to become part of the GEICO family in 2009 after the great service and value I personally received from GEICO as a policyholder. I know the Bay Area well, and understand your needs to protect what's important to you.
I proudly support the San Francisco Chapter of Make a Wish Foundation, and The Bay Institute which protects and restores watersheds that drain into the San Francisco Bay. Are you into charity walks and runs? I invite you to stop by the GEICO tent for fun and refreshments at the Annual Walk for Wishes at Saint Mary's College, San Francisco Bay to Breakers and the Oakland Running Festival.
For our Spanish speaking customers, there are full-time Spanish-speaking staffers in the office. (Representantes que hablan español están disponibles en esta oficina.) 
How To Find The Pleasant Hill Office
We are conveniently located off Interstate 680 (Exit 49B) and Monument Boulevard in the Crossroads Shopping Center. Our office is found between the two shopping center entrances on Buskirk Avenue. Stop by or call us today!

Find a GEICO Insurance Agent serving San Francisco.
Ask a friend who's not from San Francisco what first comes to mind when they think of San Francisco, and it's likely they'd bring up fog, earthquakes, hills... and maybe Chinatown. But locals know there's more to the City by the Bay than meets the eye.
Your GEICO Insurance Agents in San Francisco know there's a lot more to the Bay Area than the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Lombard Street, and Silicon Valley. That's because they're your neighbors. They know where to find the best seafood in the city, where to shop for the best vintage clothes, even which routes to take to avoid the inevitable congestion on Highway 101.
Driving in San Francisco can get pretty crazy, but that doesn't mean shopping for insurance has to be crazy, too. Contact a San Francisco GEICO Insurance Agent for a free quote on auto, motorcycle, RV, homeowners, renters or condo insurance. Your local agents can help you customize a policy for your unique needs and help you save as much as possible off your premium.
When you get a quote, be sure to mention if you're a Military member stationed at USCG Air Station San Francisco or at another Military installation in Northern California—you could get a Military discount! Alumni of UC San Francisco, Golden Gate University, or the University of San Francisco could also qualify for a special discount.
Contact your San Francisco insurance agent and find out how much you could save.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $52.77 (5.31% upside)

Find out how Marlon Zarate, your GEICO Insurance Agent in San Mateo, could help you save money on more than just your car insurance.

Hello, my name is Marlon Zarate. I have been an insurance agent for over 10 years, and I opened my local GEICO office in San Mateo in 2015.
From San Francisco to Mountain View, my office would be happy to help Peninsula area residents see how much they could save on more than just car insurance. Ask us about motorcycle insurance, boat insurance, ATV insurance, RV insurance, and more. We can also help with homeowners, renters, condo, or mobile home insurance.
My office will help you with any GEICO discounts you may qualify for, such as discounts for Military members or members of certain alumni or professional organizations.
For our Spanish-speaking customers, we have full-time Spanish-speaking agents in the office. Representantes que hablan español están disponibles en esta oficina. We also have licensed agents that speak Tagalog.
Our goal is to offer you the best possible coverage, at the most competitive price, with excellent customer service! Call today for a quote.
Spot Marlon and his team around the San Mateo community.
I enjoy giving back to the community by participating in local events and charities. I am an active member of the City of San Mateo Chamber of Commerce. I also participate in many of the Downtown San Mateo Association events, such as the Downtown Clean Up. Keep an eye out on our Facebook page for upcoming events and fun giveaways. You may even meet the Gecko!
Stop by the San Mateo GEICO office.
We are conveniently located on El Camino Real between the 92 Freeway and Downtown San Mateo. We'd love to meet you!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
