Tapco Tool's latest improvement in siding equipment; the PRO 14 series bending brakes. Featuring their exclusive Unilink technology! Never adjust your brake again. 14" (35,6 cm) throat depth with patented large inside working pockets and a 2-3/8" (6 cm) mouth opening. Lightweight, high tech anodized alloys and computer designed die castings for strong, durable performance. Patented Moving Pivot Hinge, the world's most advanced hinge design, for unparalleled bending performance. Fast, strong, positive clamping. 180 degree hemming capability for making more rigid panels. Available in 8'6", 10'6" and 12'6" lengths.
Powerful bending in a compact design makes the PRO 14 a reliable brake for the busy siding professional. The PRO 14 combines a 14” throat depth with a wide 2-3/8” mouth opening and patented inside working pockets to bend all vinyl, soft aluminum up to .030, galvanized steel up to 28 ga., and copper sheet & coil up to 16 oz.

The 12’6” version of the PRO 14 weighs in at just 129 lbs. for superior portability (8'6", 10’6” and Heavy Duty 10’6” versions are also available.) From soffit and fascia to custom brick mold, sill trim, window casing, chimney flashing and more, the PRO 14 easily produces custom pieces for any siding and roofing application. Its efficient, secure locking system uses a pulling motion rather than a pushing motion, allowing you to be closer to the tool when working with larger pieces. Individual bending handles also enhance easy operation, letting you get closer to the work. Our patented Moving Pivot Hinge allows increased bending power, and our unique hemming capability allows for 180-degree overbends to produce more rigid panels.
Tapco’s available PRO Cut-Off™ roller shear can be used with the PRO 14 for easy factory-quality cuts through various metals and all vinyl. The Side-Winder™ Coil-feeding System holds coil securely, keeping it from blowing down the street or landing in a mud puddle. Other accessories include the Wheel Kit, Snap Stand™, PRO™ Cut-Off Gauge, Angle Gauge, Material Support Table and Brake Buddy® roll-forming tool that delivers standout appeal to work pieces with its simple operation.

Saltcedar and Russian Olive control demonstration act science assessmentProduct Type: Scientific Investigations ReportYear: 2010Author(s): Shafroth, P.B., C.A. Brown, and D.M. Merritt (eds.)Suggested Citation: Shafroth, P.B., C.A. Brown, and D.M. Merritt (eds.). 2010. Saltcedar and Russian Olive control demonstration act science assessment. Scientific Investigations Report 2009-5247. U.S. Geological Survey. 143 p. The primary intent of this document is to provide the science assessment called for under The Saltcedar and Russian Olive Control Demonstration Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–320; the Act). A secondary purpose is to provide a common background for applicants for prospective demonstration projects, should funds be appropriated for this second phase of the Act. This document synthesizes the state-of-the-science on the following topics: the distribution and abundance (extent) of saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) in the Western United States, potential for water savings associated with controlling saltcedar and Russian olive and the associated restoration of occupied sites, considerations related to wildlife use of saltcedar and Russian olive habitat or restored habitats, methods to control saltcedar and Russian olive, possible utilization of dead biomass following removal of saltcedar and Russian olive, and approaches and challenges associated with revegetation or restoration following control efforts. A concluding chapter discusses possible long-term management strategies, needs for additional study, potentially useful field demonstration projects, and a planning process for on-the-ground projects involving removal of saltcedar and Russian olive...
