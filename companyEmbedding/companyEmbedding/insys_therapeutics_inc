Launch Planned for August 2017

PHOENIX, May  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) ("Insys" or "the Company") today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has approved the final product label for Syndros™ (dronabinol) oral solution, CII, a liquid formulation of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid, dronabinol.  Syndros is approved for use in treating anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS") and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.
"The finalization of the approved product label for Syndros by the FDA marks a milestone for Insys and the last regulatory step required prior to the product's launch," said Saeed Motahari, President and Chief Executive Officer of Insys.  "Syndros is the second product entirely developed and commercialized by Insys.  We maintain our commitment to bringing novel therapeutic solutions to patients in need and are excited to launch Syndros in August 2017."
"We believe Syndros represents a viable alternative for the delivery of dronabinol and will fulfill a significant unmet need for both cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy who fail traditional antiemetics and AIDS patients who experience anorexia associated with weight loss," said Stephen Sherman, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs of Insys. 
About Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV)There are currently over 15 million patients diagnosed with cancer in the United States.  Affecting 70-80% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of chemotherapy's most debilitating side effects and often attributed as a leading cause of premature discontinuation of cancer treatment.  Despite the availability of various antiemetics, CINV remains a significant issue for the cancer patient. 
About Anorexia in AIDSSince the early 1980s, there have been 1.2 million patients diagnosed in the US with AIDS. Despite the advancements for the treatment of AIDS, 7-8% of AIDS patients currently experience anorexia associated with weight loss.1 
SYNDROS™ Important Safety Information
SYNDROS™ may cause psychiatric and cognitive effects and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients with cardiac disorders may experience hypotension, hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia. Discontinue products containing disulfiram or metronidazole at least 14 days before and do not administer 7 days after treatment with SYNDROS™ (see Full Prescribing Information). 
Weigh the potential risk versus benefits before prescribing SYNDROS™ to patients with a history of seizures, including those requiring anti-epileptic medication or with other factors that lower the seizure threshold. Assess risk for abuse or misuse inpatients with a history of substance abuse or dependence, prior to prescribing SYNDROS™ and monitor for the development of associated behaviors or conditions. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation, if worsening of symptoms of paradoxical nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurs while on treatment.
To learn more about SYNDROS™, and its Important Safety Information, please contact Insys Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-855-978-2797.
About INSYSInsys Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative drugs and novel drug delivery systems of therapeutic molecules that improve the quality of life of patients. Using proprietary sublingual spray technology and capabilities to develop pharmaceutical cannabinoids, INSYS is developing a pipeline of products intending to address unmet medical needs and the clinical shortcomings of existing commercial products. INSYS currently markets one product, SUBSYS® (fentanyl sublingual spray), CII, and has received approval for the marketing of SYNDROS™ (dronabinol) oral solution, CII, a proprietary, orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol that INSYS believes has distinct advantages over the current formulation of dronabinol in soft gel capsule. INSYS is committed to developing medications for potentially treating addiction to opioids, opioid overdose, epilepsy, and other disease areas with a significant unmet need.
SUBSYS® and SYNDROS™ are trademarks of Insys Development Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Insys Therapeutics, Inc.
Forward-Looking Statements

Insys Therapeutics is an American specialty pharmaceutical company based in Chandler, Arizona, and listed on the NASDAQ (NASDAQ: INSY).
The company was founded in 1990 by the billionaire John Kapoor, who has been a director since the outset.
Insys' main product is Subsys, a sublingual spray of fentanyl. The drug fentanyl is a very fast acting and powerful opiate used to relieve peaks of pain in cancer patients.[1]
Seven former executives and managers employed by Insys were taken into custody by law enforcement Thursday December 13, 2016 U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz alleges that several former employees of Insys Therapeutics, Inc. - including the once CEO and president of the company - conspired to bribe medical staff in several states to get them to prescribe a specific pain medication.[2] This was the topic of an NBC special feature report on Megyn Kelly's 'Sunday Night' on Sunday, June 4, 2017.[3]
In 2016, Insys donated $500,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, a group opposing a marijuana legalization ballot initiative in the state of Arizona.[4] Investor filings confirm the company was concerned about the impact of legalization on sales for a cannabis-based drug it was developing.[5] The reason publicly given for opposing the measure was to "protect children".[5]

Insys Therapeutics is an American specialty pharmaceutical company based in Chandler, Arizona, and listed on the NASDAQ (NASDAQ: INSY).
The company was founded in 1990 by the billionaire John Kapoor, who has been a director since the outset.
Insys' main product is Subsys, a sublingual spray of fentanyl. The drug fentanyl is a very fast acting and powerful opiate used to relieve peaks of pain in cancer patients.[1]
Seven former executives and managers employed by Insys were taken into custody by law enforcement Thursday December 13, 2016 U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz alleges that several former employees of Insys Therapeutics, Inc. - including the once CEO and president of the company - conspired to bribe medical staff in several states to get them to prescribe a specific pain medication.[2] This was the topic of an NBC special feature report on Megyn Kelly's 'Sunday Night' on Sunday, June 4, 2017.[3]
In 2016, Insys donated $500,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, a group opposing a marijuana legalization ballot initiative in the state of Arizona.[4] Investor filings confirm the company was concerned about the impact of legalization on sales for a cannabis-based drug it was developing.[5] The reason publicly given for opposing the measure was to "protect children".[5]

Insys Therapeutics is an American specialty pharmaceutical company based in Chandler, Arizona, and listed on the NASDAQ (NASDAQ: INSY).
The company was founded in 1990 by the billionaire John Kapoor, who has been a director since the outset.
Insys' main product is Subsys, a sublingual spray of fentanyl. The drug fentanyl is a very fast acting and powerful opiate used to relieve peaks of pain in cancer patients.[1]
Seven former executives and managers employed by Insys were taken into custody by law enforcement Thursday December 13, 2016 U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Carmen Ortiz alleges that several former employees of Insys Therapeutics, Inc. - including the once CEO and president of the company - conspired to bribe medical staff in several states to get them to prescribe a specific pain medication.[2] This was the topic of an NBC special feature report on Megyn Kelly's 'Sunday Night' on Sunday, June 4, 2017.[3]
In 2016, Insys donated $500,000 to Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, a group opposing a marijuana legalization ballot initiative in the state of Arizona.[4] Investor filings confirm the company was concerned about the impact of legalization on sales for a cannabis-based drug it was developing.[5] The reason publicly given for opposing the measure was to "protect children".[5]

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!

Insys Therapeutics, Inc. Announces FDA Final Product Label for Syndros
Launch Planned for August 2017



















May 24, 2017 06:50 ET

 | Source: Insys Therapeutics, Inc.






PHOENIX, May  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) (“Insys” or “the Company”) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has approved the final product label for Syndros™ (dronabinol) oral solution, CII, a liquid formulation of the pharmaceutical cannabinoid, dronabinol.  Syndros is approved for use in treating anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (“AIDS”) and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. “The finalization of the approved product label for Syndros by the FDA marks a milestone for Insys and the last regulatory step required prior to the product's launch,” said Saeed Motahari, President and Chief Executive Officer of Insys.  “Syndros is the second product entirely developed and commercialized by Insys.  We maintain our commitment to bringing novel therapeutic solutions to patients in need and are excited to launch Syndros in August 2017.” “We believe Syndros represents a viable alternative for the delivery of dronabinol and will fulfill a significant unmet need for both cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy who fail traditional antiemetics and AIDS patients who experience anorexia associated with weight loss,” said Stephen Sherman, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs of Insys.  About Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV)There are currently over 15 million patients diagnosed with cancer in the United States.  Affecting 70-80% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of chemotherapy's most debilitating side effects and often attributed as a leading cause of premature discontinuation of cancer treatment.  Despite the availability of various antiemetics, CINV remains a significant issue for the cancer patient.  About Anorexia in AIDSSince the early 1980s, there have been 1.2 million patients diagnosed in the US with AIDS. Despite the advancements for the treatment of AIDS, 7-8% of AIDS patients currently experience anorexia associated with weight loss.1  SYNDROS™ Important Safety Information SYNDROS™ may cause psychiatric and cognitive effects and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Patients with cardiac disorders may experience hypotension, hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia. Discontinue products containing disulfiram or metronidazole at least 14 days before and do not administer 7 days after treatment with SYNDROS™ (see Full Prescribing Information).  Weigh the potential risk versus benefits before prescribing SYNDROS™ to patients with a history of seizures, including those requiring anti-epileptic medication or with other factors that lower the seizure threshold. Assess risk for abuse or misuse inpatients with a history of substance abuse or dependence, prior to prescribing SYNDROS™ and monitor for the development of associated behaviors or conditions. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation, if worsening of symptoms of paradoxical nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurs while on treatment. To learn more about SYNDROS™, and its Important Safety Information, please contact Insys Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-855-978-2797. About INSYS Insys Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative drugs and novel drug delivery systems of therapeutic molecules that improve the quality of life of patients. Using proprietary sublingual spray technology and capabilities to develop pharmaceutical cannabinoids, INSYS is developing a pipeline of products intending to address unmet medical needs and the clinical shortcomings of existing commercial products. INSYS currently markets one product, SUBSYS® (fentanyl sublingual spray), CII, and has received approval for the marketing of SYNDROS™ (dronabinol) oral solution, CII, a proprietary, orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol that INSYS believes has distinct advantages over the current formulation of dronabinol in soft gel capsule. INSYS is committed to developing medications for potentially treating addiction to opioids, opioid overdose, epilepsy, and other disease areas with a significant unmet need. SUBSYS® and SYNDROS™ are trademarks of Insys Development Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Insys Therapeutics, Inc. Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains forward-looking statements including regarding our (i) belief that the finalization of the approved product label of SYNDROS™ is a milestone for the Company, (ii) belief that SYNDROS™ represents a viable alternative for the delivery of dronabinol and will fulfill a significant unmet need for both cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy who fail traditional antiemetics and AIDS patients who experience anorexia associated with weight loss, and (iii)  belief that that SYNDROS™ has distinct advantages over the current formulation of dronabinol in soft gel capsule.

SYNDROS | The First & Only FDA-Approved Liquid Dronabinol




Insys






















Click here for important risk information.









What is SYNDROS?

SYNDROS is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat:

loss of appetite (anorexia) in people with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) who have lost weight.
nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine (chemotherapy) in people whose nausea and vomiting have not improved with usual anti-nausea medicines.



SYNDROS IS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE (CII) BECAUSE IT CONTAINS DRONABINOL WHICH CAN BE A TARGET FOR PEOPLE WHO ABUSE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES OR STREET DRUGS. KEEP YOUR SYNDROS IN A SAFE PLACE TO PROTECT IT FROM THEFT. NEVER GIVE YOUR SYNDROS TO ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE IT MAY CAUSE DEATH OR HARM THEM. SELLING OR GIVING AWAY THIS MEDICINE IS AGAINST THE LAW.
IT IS NOT KNOWN IF SYNDROS IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN CHILDREN.
Do not take SYNDROS if you:

had an allergic reaction to dronabinol. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to dronabinol include: swelling of the lips, hives, a rash over your whole body, mouth sores, skin burning, flushing, and throat tightness.
had an allergic reaction to alcohol.
are using a medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) or have taken or received a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole in the last 14 days.

Before taking SYNDROS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have or had heart problems.
have or had problems with drug abuse or dependence.
have or had problems with alcohol abuse or dependence.
have or had mental health problems including mania, depression or schizophrenia.
have had a seizure or have a medical condition that may increase your risk of having a seizure.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. SYNDROS may harm your unborn baby. Avoid the use of SYNDROS if you are pregnant.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mothers with HIV not breastfeed because they can pass the HIV through their breast milk to the baby. It is not known if SYNDROS passes into your breast milk.  Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take SYNDROS. Do not breastfeed while taking SYNDROS and for 9 days after your last dose of SYNDROS if you are being treated for nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine.

TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL THE MEDICINES YOU TAKE OR HAVE TAKEN IN THE LAST 14 DAYS, INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICINES, VITAMINS, AND HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS. SYNDROS AND CERTAIN OTHER MEDICINES CAN AFFECT EACH OTHER, CAUSING SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS..
How should I take SYNDROS?

See the "Instructions for Use" at the end of the Patient Information for detailed instructions about the right way to take SYNDROS.
Always use the oral syringe that comes with your SYNDROS oral solution to measure your prescribed dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to measure your prescribed dose.
Take SYNDROS exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may change your dose after seeing how it affects you. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to change it.
Drink a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces) right after you take your prescribed dose of SYNDROS oral solution.
If you are an adult with AIDS with loss of appetite and weight loss:
                    
SYNDROS is usually taken 2 times each day, 1 hour before lunch and 1 hour before dinner.  If you are elderly, or unable to tolerate this dose of SYNDROS, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 time each day, 1 hour before dinner or bedtime.


If you are an adult with nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine:
                    
SYNDROS is usually taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy treatment and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for up to 4 to 6 doses each day.  If you are elderly, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy, 1 time each day.
Take your first dose of SYNDROS on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. After your first dose of SYNDROS, you can take SYNDROS with or without food.
After your doctor has decided the dose of SYNDROS that is right for you, take SYNDROS exactly at the same time before or after meals during future chemotherapy treatment.


If you take too much SYNDROS, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

What should I avoid while taking SYNDROS?

Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how SYNDROS affects you. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause dizziness, confusion, and sleepiness may make these symptoms worse.

What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?
SYNDROS can cause serious side effects, including:

Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take SYNDROS. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take SYNDROS may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia.
Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly.
Changes in your blood pressure. SYNDROS may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking SYNDROS or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls.
Interactions with disulfiram or metronidazole. SYNDROS contains alcohol, which can cause you to have a reaction to medicines that contain disulfiram or metronidazole. You should not use any medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) if you take SYNDROS. You should not use a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole for at least 14 days before you start taking SYNDROS and within 7 days after your last dose of SYNDROS. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a reaction to disulfiram or metronidazole including: stomach-area (abdominal) cramping, nausea, vomiting, headache, and flushing.

What are the possible side effects of SYNDROS?
SYNDROS may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?"
Seizures. SYNDROS may increase your risk of seizures. Stop taking SYNDROS and call your doctor and get medical care right away if you have a seizure during treatment with SYNDROS.
Drug and alcohol abuse. You may have an increased risk of abusing SYNDROS if you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, including marijuana. Tell your doctor if you develop abuse behaviors such as increased irritability, nervousness, restlessness or want more or higher doses of SYNDROS during your treatment.
Nausea, vomiting, or stomach-area (abdominal) pain. Tell your doctor if you have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or if your nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain gets worse during treatment with SYNDROS.

THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF SYNDROS INCLUDE:

stomach-area (abdominal) pain
dizziness
feeling extremely happy (euphoria)
nausea
overly suspicious or feeling people want to harm you (paranoid reaction)
sleepiness
abnormal thoughts
vomiting

THESE ARE NOT ALL THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF SYNDROS. TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECT THAT BOTHERS YOU OR DOES NOT GO AWAY. CALL YOUR DOCTOR FOR MEDICAL ADVICE ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS. YOU MAY REPORT SIDE EFFECTS TO FDA AT 1-800-FDA-1088.
General information about the safe and effective use of SYNDROS
MEDICINES ARE SOMETIMES PRESCRIBED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THOSE LISTED IN A PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET. DO NOT USE SYNDROS FOR A CONDITION FOR WHICH IT WAS NOT PRESCRIBED. DO NOT GIVE SYNDROS TO OTHER PEOPLE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS THAT YOU HAVE. IT MAY HARM THEM. YOU CAN ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST FOR INFORMATION ABOUT SYNDROS THAT IS WRITTEN FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

SUBSYS is used for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying constant cancer pain. 
SUBSYS is the first and only breakthrough pain medication for patients with cancer offered as a sublingual spray. SUBSYS may provide pain relief in as little as 5 minutes. SUBSYS is a unique fentanyl sublingual spray that delivers a fine mist of medication underneath the tongue to provide pain relief. It is the first and only sublingual spray for breakthrough cancer pain. 
Scroll for Indication, Limitations of Use and Important Safety Information Including Boxed Warning

Indication
SUBSYS® is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, or at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids when taking SUBSYS.
This product must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients because life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in patients not on a chronic regimen of opioids. For this reason, SUBSYS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain.
Limitations of Use
Not for use in opioid non-tolerant patients.
Not for use in the management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraine, dental pain, or in the emergency room.
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, SUBSYS is available only as part of the Transmucosal Immediate-Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program. SUBSYS may be dispensed only to outpatients enrolled in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient enrollment is not required.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS; ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; REMS and NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 

Serious, life-threatening, and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, SUBSYS is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.
Accidental ingestion of SUBSYS, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Keep out of reach of children. Ensure proper storage and disposal.
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other oral transmucosal fentanyl product to SUBSYS.
When dispensing, do not substitute with any other fentanyl products.
SUBSYS exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.
SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors are required to enroll in the program.
Prolonged use of SUSYS during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.

WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS; ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; REMS and NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME
Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression
Serious, life-threatening, and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with SUBSYS, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of SUBSYS or following a dose increase.  The substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
Due to the risk of respiratory depression, SUBSYS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients. [see Contraindications (4)].    
Accidental Ingestion
Accidental ingestion of even one dose of SUBSYS especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.16)].
Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. SUBSYS must be kept out of reach of children [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3); How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)].
Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction
The concomitant use of SUBSYS with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving SUBSYS and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants 
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7)].

Reserve concomitant prescribing of SUBSYS and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

Risk of Medication Errors
Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products, including other TIRF formulations, that result in clinically important differences in the extent of absorption of fentanyl that could result in fatal overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  

When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other fentanyl products to SUBSYS.
When dispensing, do not substitute a SUBSYS prescription for other fentanyl products.

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse
SUBSYS exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing SUBSYS, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Contraindications

Opioid non-tolerant patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in opioid non-tolerant patients
Acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and dental pain, or in the emergency department
Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in absence of resuscitative equipment.
Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.
Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to fentanyl or components of SUBSYS

Warnings and Precautions

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death.  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of SUBSYS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. 
In cancer patients with mucositis, exposure to SUBSYS was greater than in patients without mucositis. For patients with Grade 1 mucositis, the increased maximum serum concentration and overall exposure requires closer monitoring for respiratory depression and central nervous system depression, particularly during initiation of therapy with SUBSYS
For patients with Grade 2 mucositis or higher, avoid the use of SUBSYS unless the benefits outweigh the potential risk of respiratory depression from increased exposure 
Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that SUBSYS contains a medicine in an amount that can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate–release fentanyl products. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed of as soon as possible
Concomitant use of SUBSYS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythmycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of SUBSYS is achieved.  Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in SUBSYS-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.  When using SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in SUBSYS-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of SUBSYS until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of SUBSYS with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol).  Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to SUBSYS from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as SUBSYS and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. SUBSYS is NOT a generic version of other transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a SUBSYS prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and SUBSYS are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.
SUBSYS contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.  As an opioid, SUBSYS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed SUBSYS. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as SUBSYS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of SUBSYS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. 
Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.
Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate.  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.
The use of SUBSYS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. 
	
Patients treated with SUBSYS who have significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of SUBSYS. 
Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.


Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of SUBSYS with serotonergic drugs.  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.
SUBSYS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients.  There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs.
Administer SUBSYS with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) as SUBSYS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure.
SUBSYS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The fentanyl in SUBSYS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase.  Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.    
The fentanyl in SUBSYS may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.
Patients taking SUBSYS must be warned that opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking SUBSYS of these dangers and counsel them accordingly.
Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use SUBSYS with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.

Drug Interactions

Monitor patients for opioid toxicity who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, inhibitors of CYP450 3A4, or stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, inducers of CYP450 3A4.
Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.
MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).
Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of SUBSYS and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
Fentanyl may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

Adverse Reactions

The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including SUBSYS are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression.
The most common adverse events subsequent to titration (frequency ? 5%): nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, dyspnea, and anxiety.
The most common adverse events during titration (frequency ? 5%): nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness.
The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of SUBSYS was nausea.

What is SYNDROS?
SYNDROS is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat:

loss of appetite (anorexia) in people with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) who have lost weight.
nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine (chemotherapy) in people whose nausea and vomiting have not improved with usual anti-nausea medicines.

SYNDROS is a controlled substance (CII) because it contains dronabinol which can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines or street drugs. Keep your SYNDROS in a safe place to protect it from theft. Never give your SYNDROS to anyone else because it may cause death or harm them. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.
It is not known if SYNDROS is safe and effective in children.
Do not take SYNDROS if you:

had an allergic reaction to dronabinol. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to dronabinol include: swelling of the lips, hives, a rash over your whole body, mouth sores, skin burning, flushing, and throat tightness.
had an allergic reaction to alcohol.
are using a medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) or have taken or received a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole in the last 14 days.

Before taking SYNDROS, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have or had heart problems.
have or had problems with drug abuse or dependence.
have or had problems with alcohol abuse or dependence.
have or had mental health problems including mania, depression or schizophrenia.
have had a seizure or have a medical condition that may increase your risk of having a seizure.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. SYNDROS may harm your unborn baby. Avoid the use of SYNDROS if you are pregnant.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mothers with HIV not breastfeed because they can pass the HIV through their breast milk to the baby. It is not known if SYNDROS passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take SYNDROS. Do not breastfeed while taking SYNDROS and for 9 days after your last dose of SYNDROS if you are being treated for nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or have taken in the last 14 days, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. SYNDROS and certain other medicines can affect each other, causing serious side effects.
How should I take SYNDROS?

See the "Instructions for Use" at the end of the Patient Information for detailed instructions about the right way to take SYNDROS.
Always use the oral syringe that comes with your SYNDROS oral solution to measure your prescribed dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to measure your prescribed dose.
Take SYNDROS exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may change your dose after seeing how it affects you. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to change it.
Drink a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces) right after you take your prescribed dose of SYNDROS oral solution.
If you are an adult with AIDS with loss of appetite and weight loss:
	
SYNDROS is usually taken 2 times each day, 1 hour before lunch and 1 hour before dinner. If you are elderly, or unable to tolerate this dose of SYNDROS, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 time each day, 1 hour before dinner or bedtime.


If you are an adult with nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine:
	
SYNDROS is usually taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy treatment and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for up to 4 to 6 doses each day. If you are elderly, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy, 1 time each day.
Take your first dose of SYNDROS on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. After your first dose of SYNDROS, you can take SYNDROS with or without food.
After your doctor has decided the dose of SYNDROS that is right for you, take SYNDROS exactly at the same time before or after meals during future chemotherapy treatment.


If you take too much SYNDROS, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

What should I avoid while taking SYNDROS?

Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how SYNDROS affects you. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause dizziness, confusion, and sleepiness may make these symptoms worse.

What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?
SYNDROS can cause serious side effects, including:

Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take SYNDROS. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take SYNDROS may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia.
Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly.
Changes in your blood pressure. SYNDROS may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking SYNDROS or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls.
Interactions with disulfiram or metronidazole. SYNDROS contains alcohol, which can cause you to have a reaction to medicines that contain disulfiram or metronidazole. You should not use any medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) if you take SYNDROS. You should not use a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole for at least 14 days before you start taking SYNDROS and within 7 days after your last dose of SYNDROS. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a reaction to disulfiram or metronidazole including: stomach-area (abdominal) cramping, nausea, vomiting, headache, and flushing.

What are the possible side effects of SYNDROS?
SYNDROS may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?"
Seizures. SYNDROS may increase your risk of seizures. Stop taking SYNDROS and call your doctor and get medical care right away if you have a seizure during treatment with SYNDROS.
Drug and alcohol abuse. You may have an increased risk of abusing SYNDROS if you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, including marijuana. Tell your doctor if you develop abuse behaviors such as increased irritability, nervousness, restlessness or want more or higher doses of SYNDROS during your treatment.
Nausea, vomiting, or stomach-area (abdominal) pain. Tell your doctor if you have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or if your nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain gets worse during treatment with SYNDROS.

The most common side effects of SYNDROS include:

stomach-area (abdominal) pain
dizziness
feeling extremely happy (euphoria)
nausea
overly suspicious or feeling people want to harm you (paranoid reaction)
sleepiness
abnormal thoughts
vomiting

These are not all the possible side effects of SYNDROS. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
General information about the safe and effective use of SYNDROS
Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use SYNDROS for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give SYNDROS to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information about SYNDROS that is written for health professionals.

SUBSYS is used for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying constant cancer pain. 
SUBSYS is the first and only breakthrough pain medication for patients with cancer offered as a sublingual spray. SUBSYS may provide pain relief in as little as 5 minutes. SUBSYS is a unique fentanyl sublingual spray that delivers a fine mist of medication underneath the tongue to provide pain relief. It is the first and only sublingual spray for breakthrough cancer pain. 
Scroll for Indication, Limitations of Use and Important Safety Information Including Boxed Warning

Indication
SUBSYS® is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.
Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking for one week or longer, around-the-clock medicine consisting of at least 60 mg of oral morphine per day, at least 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, or at least 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, or at least 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids when taking SUBSYS.
This product must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients because life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in patients not on a chronic regimen of opioids. For this reason, SUBSYS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain.
Limitations of Use
Not for use in opioid non-tolerant patients.
Not for use in the management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraine, dental pain, or in the emergency room.
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, SUBSYS is available only as part of the Transmucosal Immediate-Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program. SUBSYS may be dispensed only to outpatients enrolled in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient enrollment is not required.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS; ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; REMS and NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 

Serious, life-threatening, and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, SUBSYS is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.
Accidental ingestion of SUBSYS, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Keep out of reach of children. Ensure proper storage and disposal.
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other oral transmucosal fentanyl product to SUBSYS.
When dispensing, do not substitute with any other fentanyl products.
SUBSYS exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.
SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors are required to enroll in the program.
Prolonged use of SUSYS during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.

WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS; RISK OF MEDICATION ERRORS; ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; REMS and NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME
Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression
Serious, life-threatening, and/or fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with SUBSYS, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing.  Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of SUBSYS or following a dose increase.  The substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
Due to the risk of respiratory depression, SUBSYS is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and in opioid non-tolerant patients. [see Contraindications (4)].    
Accidental Ingestion
Accidental ingestion of even one dose of SUBSYS especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.16)].
Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products. SUBSYS must be kept out of reach of children [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3); How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)].
Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction
The concomitant use of SUBSYS with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving SUBSYS and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants 
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7)].

Reserve concomitant prescribing of SUBSYS and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

Risk of Medication Errors
Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products, including other TIRF formulations, that result in clinically important differences in the extent of absorption of fentanyl that could result in fatal overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].  

When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other fentanyl products to SUBSYS.
When dispensing, do not substitute a SUBSYS prescription for other fentanyl products.

Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse
SUBSYS exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing SUBSYS, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program
Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSaccess.com or by calling 1-866-822-1483.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Contraindications

Opioid non-tolerant patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death could occur at any dose in opioid non-tolerant patients
Acute or postoperative pain including headache/migraine and dental pain, or in the emergency department
Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in absence of resuscitative equipment.
Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.
Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to fentanyl or components of SUBSYS

Warnings and Precautions

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death.  While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of SUBSYS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. 
In cancer patients with mucositis, exposure to SUBSYS was greater than in patients without mucositis. For patients with Grade 1 mucositis, the increased maximum serum concentration and overall exposure requires closer monitoring for respiratory depression and central nervous system depression, particularly during initiation of therapy with SUBSYS
For patients with Grade 2 mucositis or higher, avoid the use of SUBSYS unless the benefits outweigh the potential risk of respiratory depression from increased exposure 
Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that SUBSYS contains a medicine in an amount that can be fatal to a child. Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate–release fentanyl products. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed of as soon as possible
Concomitant use of SUBSYS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythmycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of SUBSYS is achieved.  Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in SUBSYS-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.  When using SUBSYS with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in SUBSYS-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of SUBSYS until stable drug effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of SUBSYS with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol).  Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
When prescribing, DO NOT convert a patient to SUBSYS from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as SUBSYS and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis. SUBSYS is NOT a generic version of other transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, DO NOT substitute a SUBSYS prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and SUBSYS are not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of SUBSYS compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of SUBSYS for any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.
SUBSYS contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.  As an opioid, SUBSYS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed SUBSYS. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as SUBSYS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of SUBSYS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. 
Because of the risk of misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], SUBSYS is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g. hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of SUBSYS, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.
Prolonged use of SUBSYS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate.  Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.
The use of SUBSYS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. 
	
Patients treated with SUBSYS who have significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of SUBSYS. 
Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.


Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of SUBSYS with serotonergic drugs.  Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.
SUBSYS may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients.  There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs.
Administer SUBSYS with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) as SUBSYS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure.
SUBSYS is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The fentanyl in SUBSYS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.  Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase.  Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.    
The fentanyl in SUBSYS may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures.
Patients taking SUBSYS must be warned that opioid analgesics impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery). Warn patients taking SUBSYS of these dangers and counsel them accordingly.
Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. Therefore, use SUBSYS with caution in patients with bradyarrhythmias.

Drug Interactions

Monitor patients for opioid toxicity who begin therapy with, or increase the dose of, inhibitors of CYP450 3A4, or stop therapy with, or decrease the dose of, inducers of CYP450 3A4.
Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.
MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).
Mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of SUBSYS and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
Fentanyl may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

Adverse Reactions

The most serious adverse reactions associated with all opioids including SUBSYS are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension, and shock. Follow all patients for symptoms of respiratory depression.
The most common adverse events subsequent to titration (frequency ? 5%): nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, dyspnea, and anxiety.
The most common adverse events during titration (frequency ? 5%): nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, and dizziness.
The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of SUBSYS was nausea.

have or had problems with alcohol abuse or dependence.
have or had mental health problems including mania, depression or schizophrenia.
have had a seizure or have a medical condition that may increase your risk of having a seizure.
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. SYNDROS may harm your unborn baby. Avoid the use of SYNDROS if you are pregnant.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that mothers with HIV not breastfeed because they can pass the HIV through their breast milk to the baby. It is not known if SYNDROS passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take SYNDROS. Do not breastfeed while taking SYNDROS and for 9 days after your last dose of SYNDROS if you are being treated for nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take or have taken in the last 14 days, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. SYNDROS and certain other medicines can affect each other, causing serious side effects.
How should I take SYNDROS?

See the "Instructions for Use" at the end of the Patient Information for detailed instructions about the right way to take SYNDROS.
Always use the oral syringe that comes with your SYNDROS oral solution to measure your prescribed dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to measure your prescribed dose.
Take SYNDROS exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor may change your dose after seeing how it affects you. Do not change your dose unless your doctor tells you to change it.
Drink a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces) right after you take your prescribed dose of SYNDROS oral solution.
If you are an adult with AIDS with loss of appetite and weight loss:
	
SYNDROS is usually taken 2 times each day, 1 hour before lunch and 1 hour before dinner. If you are elderly, or unable to tolerate this dose of SYNDROS, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 time each day, 1 hour before dinner or bedtime.


If you are an adult with nausea and vomiting caused by anti-cancer medicine:
	
SYNDROS is usually taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy treatment and then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy for up to 4 to 6 doses each day. If you are elderly, your doctor may prescribe SYNDROS to be taken 1 to 3 hours before your chemotherapy, 1 time each day.
Take your first dose of SYNDROS on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before eating. After your first dose of SYNDROS, you can take SYNDROS with or without food.
After your doctor has decided the dose of SYNDROS that is right for you, take SYNDROS exactly at the same time before or after meals during future chemotherapy treatment.


If you take too much SYNDROS, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

What should I avoid while taking SYNDROS?

Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how SYNDROS affects you. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause dizziness, confusion, and sleepiness may make these symptoms worse.

What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?
SYNDROS can cause serious side effects, including:

Worsening mental (psychiatric) symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms can worsen in people who have mania, depression, or schizophrenia and who take SYNDROS. SYNDROS taken with medicines that cause psychiatric symptoms can worsen psychiatric symptoms. Elderly people who take SYNDROS may have a greater risk of having psychiatric symptoms. Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening mood symptoms, including symptoms of mania, depression, or schizophrenia.
Problems thinking clearly. Tell your doctor if you have trouble remembering things, concentrating, have increased sleepiness, or confusion. Elderly people may have a greater risk of having problems thinking clearly.
Changes in your blood pressure. SYNDROS may increase or decrease your blood pressure, especially when you start taking SYNDROS or when your dose is changed. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of changes in your blood pressure including: headaches, vision problems, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or a fast heartbeat. Elderly people, especially those with dementia, and people with heart problems may have an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and an increased risk of falls.
Interactions with disulfiram or metronidazole. SYNDROS contains alcohol, which can cause you to have a reaction to medicines that contain disulfiram or metronidazole. You should not use any medicine that contains disulfiram (Antabuse) or metronidazole (Pylera, Flagyl, Flagyl ER, Nuvessa, Vandazole) if you take SYNDROS. You should not use a medicine that contains disulfiram or metronidazole for at least 14 days before you start taking SYNDROS and within 7 days after your last dose of SYNDROS. Tell your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of a reaction to disulfiram or metronidazole including: stomach-area (abdominal) cramping, nausea, vomiting, headache, and flushing.

What are the possible side effects of SYNDROS?
SYNDROS may cause serious side effects, including:

See "What is the most important information I should know about SYNDROS?"
Seizures. SYNDROS may increase your risk of seizures. Stop taking SYNDROS and call your doctor and get medical care right away if you have a seizure during treatment with SYNDROS.
Drug and alcohol abuse. You may have an increased risk of abusing SYNDROS if you have a history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, including marijuana. Tell your doctor if you develop abuse behaviors such as increased irritability, nervousness, restlessness or want more or higher doses of SYNDROS during your treatment.
Nausea, vomiting, or stomach-area (abdominal) pain. Tell your doctor if you have nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain or if your nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain gets worse during treatment with SYNDROS.

The most common side effects of SYNDROS include:

stomach-area (abdominal) pain
dizziness
feeling extremely happy (euphoria)
nausea
overly suspicious or feeling people want to harm you (paranoid reaction)
sleepiness
abnormal thoughts
vomiting

These are not all the possible side effects of SYNDROS. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
General information about the safe and effective use of SYNDROS
Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use SYNDROS for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give SYNDROS to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for information about SYNDROS that is written for health professionals.
What are the ingredients in SYNDROS?
Active ingredient: dronabinol
Inactive ingredients: dehydrated alcohol, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, sucralose, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, butylated hydroxyanisole, and water

Investor Overview - Investors - INSYS Therapeutics Inc.

 Investor OverviewStock InformationNews & EventsCorporate GovernanceFinancial InformationInvestor FAQsContact Investor RelationsPrint PageEmail PageEmail AlertsRSS FeedsFinancial Tear SheetInvestor OverviewWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative drugs and novel drug delivery systems of therapeutic molecules that improve the quality of patients' lives.
Using our proprietary sublingual spray technology and our capability to develop pharmaceutical cannabinoids, Insys addresses the clinical shortcomings of existing commercial products. Insys currently markets two products, Subsys®, which is sublingual Fentanyl spray for breakthrough cancer pain, and a generic version of Dronabinol (THC) capsules.
In March 2012, we launched Subsys®
, our proprietary sublingual fentanyl spray for breakthrough cancer pain, or BTCP, in adult opioid-tolerant patients, through our cost-efficient commercial organization of approximately 250 sales professionals.
Since late 2014, Subsys®
 has been the most prescribed transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl, or TIRF, product with 48% market share on a prescription basis, according to IMS.
In December 2011, we launched Dronabinol SG Capsule, a generic equivalent to Marinol (dronabinol), an approved second-line treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, or CINV, and anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS, through our exclusive distributor, a leading generic pharmaceutical company.
Our lead product candidate is Dronabinol Oral Solution, a proprietary orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol, which would be our second branded supportive care product, if approved. We intend to market Dronabinol Oral Solution and any other future supportive care products, if approved, through our commercial organization. 
Please see full prescribing information for Subsys® including the boxed warning.
