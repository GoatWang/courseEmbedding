About Wood Prints



Front View

Back View

Bring your artwork to life with the texture and depth of a wood print.   Your image gets printed directly onto a sheet of 3/4" thick maple wood.
All wood prints ship within 3 - 4 business days and arrive "ready to hang" with mounting hooks and nails.
Wood prints are extremely durable and add a rustic feel to any image.
For additional product photos and information, visit our wood prints product page.

Her art is shown primarily in leading galleries in the Pacific Northwest. An award winning cover piece for a Vancouver magazine was displayed in the National Library, Ottawa. Her images have also been commissioned by a Fortune 100 company for a customer event.  

"What is it all about? What is the artist trying to say?" Her answer to these questions is that there is no answer! Paradoxically, the viewer...

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

This firm’s lawyers do not have peer reviews.


*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Testimonials or endorsements in any review do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.

About Canvas Prints






Corner Detail: Stretched canvas print with 1.5" stretcher bars and mirrored image sides.   Also available with black sides, whites sides, and 5/8" stretcher bars.

Bring your artwork to life with the texture and depth of a stretched canvas print.   Your image gets printed on one of our premium canvases and then stretched on a wooden frame of 1.5" x 1.5" stretcher bars (gallery wrap) or 5/8" x 5/8" stretcher bars (museum wrap).   All stretched canvases ship within 3 - 4 business days and arrive "ready to hang" with pre-attached hanging wire, mounting hooks, and nails.
Stretched canvas prints look beautiful with or without frames.
Fine Art America is one of the largest, most-respected giclee printing companies in the world with over 40 years of experience producing museum-quality prints.   All of our prints are produced on state-of-the-art, professional-grade Epson printers.   We use acid-free papers and canvases with archival inks to guarantee that your prints last a lifetime without fading or loss of color.




Artist's Description

In 1994, a cave was discovered in the south of France; believed to have been occupied 32,000 years ago, it is not open to the public and is being carefully preserved by the French government. The wall art is exquisite and depicts the animals of the time. I have been privileged to paint the work from viewing photographs and have tried to remain faithful to the long ago time.



About Beverly  Koski



Beverly  Koski

A graduate of the Victoria College of Art in Canada, Bev has travelled widely, and enjoyed four careers: x-ray technician, mother, realtor and artist. She counts the successful lives of her three adult children as her most important achievement. She aims for visually intriguing pieces, reflective of the complexity in each of our lives. Her art is shown primarily in leading galleries in the Pacific Northwest. An award winning cover piece for a Vancouver magazine was displayed in the National Library, Ottawa. Her images have also been commissioned by a Fortune 100 company for a customer event.  

"What is it all about? What is the artist trying to say?" Her answer to these questions is that there is no answer! Paradoxically, the viewer...

Purchase museum-quality canvas prints from the world's greatest living artists and photographers or upload your own photos and transform them into personal works of art.   Each canvas print is hand-crafted at one of our global production facilities using premium cotton / poly canvases, pine stretcher bars, and archival inks.



Browse through millions of canvas prints, below, from the world's greatest living artists, photographers, and iconic brands.





Sizes
Choose from 15 different print sizes starting a 6" x 6" and going all the way up to 50" x 108".
Square, rectangular, panoramic - we have them all.
You can order your canvas print "rolled in a tube" or have it stretched on stretcher bars for immediate mounting on your wall when it arrives.
We offer two different stretcher bar thicknesses: 1.5" and 5/8".
1.5" stretcher bars are perfect if you want to mount your canvas print directly to your wall without a frame.
If you want to frame your canvas print, 5/8" stretcher bars are the way to go.   The thinner stretcher bars work with the widest selection of available frames.






Craftsmanship
Fine Art America is the largest canvas print manufacturer in the world.   We have 14 fulfillment centers located in five different countries and produce museum-quality canvas prints for hundreds of thousands of artists, photographers, and iconic brands.
Our expert staff prints each canvas using archival inks which are designed to last for 75 years without fading and then hand-stretches each print onto durable, pine stretcher bars.
Your canvas print will be ready to ship within 2 - 3 days after you place your order, and you can ship it to any destination in the world.
Every print includes a 30-day money-back guarantee.   If you're not happy with your purchase, for any reason, you can send it back for a refund.   Don't worry - you're going to love it!







Hundreds of Frames
Customize your canvas print with one of our 150+ frames.
For canvas prints with 1.5" thick stretcher bars, we offer contemporary floater frames in both metal and wood to accent your print and stand it off from the wall.
For canvas prints with 5/8" thick stretcher bars, you can choose from a larger selection of traditional frames which overlap outer edge of your print and provide a museum-quality look.





Three Wrap Styles: Black, White, and Mirrored
There are three options available for the wrapped sides of your print: black, white, and mirrored.
If you select the mirrored option, then the outer edges of your image will be mirrored onto wrapped sides of your print (as shown in the photo on the left).
If you select black, the wrapped sides of the print will solid black.
If you select white, the wrapped sides of the print will solid white.





Two Canvas Materials: Glossy and Matte
Glossy Canvas: With a glossy finish formula specially designed for pigmented inks, this canvas lovingly recreates the texture and reflectivity of oils on canvas.   It also lends a fine art feel to photographs.   Bulldog Glossy Canvas has a slightly warm tone and is made from an acid-free poly/cotton blend.
Matte Canvas: The texture and weight of this canvas brings fine art reproductions one step closer to the originals, while the matte finish gives them a softness that invites attention.   Chromata Matte Canvas has a bright white tone and is made from an acid-free poly/cotton blend.







Mounting
Your canvas print will arrive with everything that you need to mount it on your wall.
Small canvas prints (less than 20" x 16" in size) include a saw-tooth hanger on the back, and medium to large canvas prints include a hanging wire.
You'll also receive a small plastic bag containing mounting hooks and nails.






Quality & Care
Our canvas prints are produced using archival inks which are designed to last 75 years without fading or loss of color.
As long as you don't place your print outdoors where it will be subjected to high humidity, extreme temperatures, and/or direct rain, your print will last a lifetime!






Lead Times and Delivery
Fine Art America is the largest canvas print manufacturer in the world.   We have 14 fulfillment centers located in five different countries and produce museum-quality canvas prints for hundreds of thousands of artists, photographers, and iconic brands.
Your canvas print will be hand-crafted by our expert staff at the fulfillment center that is located closest to your destination shipping address.   Your print will be ready to ship within 2 - 3 days after you place your order, and then standard UPS / FedEx shipping times apply.   You can ship your canvas print to any destination in the world.
Every print includes a 30-day money-back guarantee.   If you're not happy with your purchase, for any reason, you can send it back for a refund.   Don't worry - you're going to love it!
