Goldman Steps Up Middle Market Lending Efforts

							Goldman Sachs is diving into middle market lending.
						


By Dan Freed





Goldman Sachs is
    diving into middle market lending. The firm has added five or
    six v.p.s to its lending group, and its bankers have been
    instructed to double their efforts to finance deals of less
    than $200 million, according to a banker in touch with Goldman
    executives. Calls to Steve Hickey, head of bank loan
    sales and trading at the firm, were not returned by press time
    last Friday afternoon.
Middle market lending has become an increasingly popular
    business. It is on the agenda of Bennett
    Goodman, new chief of Credit Suisse First
    Boston's $29 billion alternative investments
    division (CFW, 3/28). It is also attracting institutional money
    managers, such as GoldenTree Asset
    Management and Friedberg
    Milstein (CFW, 11/24, 12/22). And several private
    equity firms have announced their intention to follow the lead
    of Apollo
    Management in launching Business Development
    Companies--publicly traded funds that lend to the middle
    market.
Despite the competition, Goldman executives still believe
    the middle market has some big advantages over blockbuster
    deals, said the banker. If the firm underwrites a $150 million
    term loan on its own, it can earn 2.5%--a $3.75 million fee. On
    a $600 million deal, Goldman's fees get squeezed to 1.75%, or
    $10.5 million. And if there are three underwriters on the deal,
    Goldman's share of that $10.5 million becomes $3.5 million.
    League table credit is similarly watered down on large co-led
    deals. Big ticket deals are also time-consuming as they
    typically involve numerous four-way conference calls so that
    all the underwriters can be involved.
Goldman was sole underwriter on a recent $140 million
    facility for Vutek, a maker of digital
    printers. It was also all alone on a $205 million deal for
    frozen food maker Luigino's in March and a $125
    million loan in March for Baker Tanks in January.

PRESS RELEASE
WEST PALM BEACH, FL–(Marketwired – July 21, 2015) – Comvest Partners, through its Comvest Capital lending platform (“Comvest”), is pleased to announce that its third direct lending fund, Comvest Capital III, has closed on a $100 million committed revolving credit facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA (“Goldman Sachs”), with an additional $50 million upsize structured through an uncommitted accordion feature (the “Facility”). This announcement follows Comvest’s final closing of Comvest Capital III in June of 2015 with $450 million in capital commitments, above the initial target of $350 million. With the addition of the Facility, Comvest Capital III will have up to $600 million of available capital, including the accordion upsize.
“We are very pleased to have closed this credit facility with Goldman Sachs as it provides Comvest with additional capital to deploy in our lower middle-market lending strategy. With this Facility, we can now offer a wider range of financing solutions, giving us greater flexibility to meet the unique needs of our borrowers. Together with our successful fund raise completed in June, we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide this important source of capital to our portfolio companies,” said Jason Gelberd, Managing Director.
Comvest Capital provides flexible financing solutions to companies in the lower middle-market across a broad range of industries, with a focus on companies in the healthcare, technology, transportation, financial services, media and manufacturing industries. The lending strategy primarily focuses on providing senior secured debt to less competitive segments of the market, lower middle-market businesses, and non-sponsored businesses. Comvest Capital is part of Comvest Partners’ broader private equity investment platform.
About Comvest Partners:
Comvest Partners is a private investment firm providing equity and debt capital to middle-market companies across the U.S. Since its founding in 2000, the firm has invested over $1.9 billion. Today, Comvest’s funds have over $2.3 billion of assets under management.
