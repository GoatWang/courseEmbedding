Dr. Susan R Holliday
Psychologist, RN, PhD

As a Nurse and a Psychologist, I use a relationship based format to understand what mechanisms a person has learned to cope with life stresses. I work with people to improve daily functioning and create a healthy and competent lifestyle. My approach uses methods from a variety of psychological theories. I try to individualize my approach to meet each client’s needs. I am interactive, combining listening and support with education and change.
At times, people may respond to life events with a mixture of negative emotions- anxiety, anger, depression. I help people understand the source and consequence of their emotions and behaviors and identify ways to change to regain a balanced life.
Because of my expertise in the biological basis of behavior, I work a lot with issues regarding psychological and physical interactions. I also deal with transitions and loss from adolescents to the elderly.

Clients
Dr Holliday works with adults and adolescents, ages 14 and up. She has worked extensively with the elderly as well as with young adults. She does individual, couples, and family psychotherapy. She receives many referrals from area physicians and mental health practitioners. In fact, over half of these doctors have referred their own immediate family and friends to her.
Treatment Specialties
The six general types of problems that Dr. Holliday treats include:

Adjustments of daily living- stress, parenting, relationships, women’s issues, transitions, grief and loss, divorce, school adjustment, worrying, low      self-esteem, insomnia, weight issues, adolescent and young adult concerns.
Aging-      transitions, care-giver stress, parenting mom and dad, dementia,      personality changes in the elderly, coping with change, grief and loss.
Coping      with stress
Medical      conditions- coping with illness, mind-body interactions, chronic illness and pain, navigating the medical      system.
Mood      disorders- depression, anxiety, anger.
Post-traumatic      stress disorder- trauma, abuse.

Approach to Treatment
Dr. Holliday uses an eclectic approach, meaning she borrows from many psychological frameworks rather than strictly adhering to one theory of behavior. In this way, she can individualize treatment based on the client’s specific needs and experiences. Primarily, she uses cognitive-behavioral, systems, and psychodynamic strategies to help people achieve their goals. Dr. Holliday is interactive with clients: listening to their concerns, offering support and guidance, and helping them identify and change maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.
First Visit
During the first visit, Dr. Holliday will gather information about your life and current concerns. She may ask you to complete some questionnaires to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning. She will discuss office policy with you. She follows the HIPAA guidelines for ethical behavior, confidentiality, security, and record keeping. She will encourage you to determine the frequency of future appointments and to let her know what you need. Most people attend therapy once a week for a 40-55 minute visit.
Billing and Fees
Most people have insurance that usually covers about 80% of the fee. You will need to check with your insurance company to make sure that they will pay for therapy with Dr. Holliday and to determine your co-pay. Some companies require that you have a referral from your Medical Doctor before seeing Dr. Holliday or that you obtain a pre-authorization from them before the first visit. Dr. Holliday accepts many different insurance plans. She is a preferred provider with Premera, Regence, BC/BS, Aetna, Uniform Medical Plan, and First Choice. You are responsible to pay your co-pay at each visit.  Dr. Holliday also charges an annual administration fee to cover time spent on client services outside of billable sessions. This fee is not reimbursable by insurance. It will be collected during your second visit. If you need to cancel an appointment, Dr. Holliday requests that you do so at least 36 hours ahead of your scheduled appointment time. Cancellations with less than 36 hours notice or missed appointments will be charged at the billable rate. Insurance does not reimburse for missed appointments.

Dr. Susan R Holliday
Psychologist, RN, PhD

As a Nurse and a Psychologist, I use a relationship based format to understand what mechanisms a person has learned to cope with life stresses. I work with people to improve daily functioning and create a healthy and competent lifestyle. My approach uses methods from a variety of psychological theories. I try to individualize my approach to meet each client’s needs. I am interactive, combining listening and support with education and change.
At times, people may respond to life events with a mixture of negative emotions- anxiety, anger, depression. I help people understand the source and consequence of their emotions and behaviors and identify ways to change to regain a balanced life.
Because of my expertise in the biological basis of behavior, I work a lot with issues regarding psychological and physical interactions. I also deal with transitions and loss from adolescents to the elderly.
