Make Every Visitor Count
 
































Schedule Visits








Prospective students register for visits, open houses and one-on-one meetings from anywhere on your institution’s website using VisitDays Mobi.

Mobi makes scheduling a visit personal, engaging and simple. When visitors don’t need to create a log in or scroll through never-ending forms, more prospective students actually register for visits.












































Automate Reminder Texts & Emails








The moment a prospective student registers for a visit, she and her guests are a part of your personalized, automated and institution-branded communication plan.

By seamlessly blending emails and text messages, everyone knows exactly where to go and who to meet. If plans change, they can cancel and reschedule via text message and email, too.


























Check In Visitors Via Text








Pencil and paper sign-in sheets do not cut it for your visits, especially larger events like an open house.

With VisitDays, every pre-registered visitor receives an automated text before the visit with a unique code to text back to check in.  For those that aren’t pre-registered or part of a large group, these visitors also can check in via text message.












































Collect Surveys Instantly








You can’t improve something if you can’t measure it. 

VisitDays delivers a mobile survey to every visitor via text message just as the visit is coming to a close. Our surveys are designed to optimize your response rate while still providing invaluable data from every visitor, even segmenting prospective students by application status.


























Actionable Visitor Analytics








Predicting the next enrollment cycle starts with truly understanding your most important recruiting tool – your visits.

VisitDays Analytics provides clear, actionable insights, including visitor application status, geographic and academic interest representation, and visit performance.












































Integrate With CRM & More








VisitDays can work as a standalone campus visit solution or connect seamlessless with your existing technologies – the choice is up to you.

Integrate VisitDays with your CRM,  marketing automation plaform, personal calendars and more.
