Donor Advised Funds

Already have an account?   Manage Your NCF Giving Fund Account








                        In partnership with the National Christian Foundation
                        (NCF)*, USA Financial Portformulas    
			            is proud to be able to offer a donor advised fund solution for charitably minded
			            individuals. Shortly after being formed in 1982, NCF went on to introduce one of
			            the first Christian-focused donor advised funds — what they call the Giving Fund®.
                    

                        Since their founding year, NCF has given more than $7 Billion in grants to charities across the world. USA Financial 
                        Portformulas is proud to play a small role in these efforts by providing an asset management solution for those that 
                        wish to leverage the many benefits of NCF's donor advised fund (DAF) solution.
                    

                        The goal of donor advised funds is to change the way in which you give. If you give to charities (big or small, secular 
                        or non-secular), the DAF is worth exploring.
                    

*Approval was based solely on National Christian Foundation’s internal criteria and standards.

Asset management for today's stock market investor.

















USA Financial has been seen on












This is no longer your father's stock market — everything has changed"
— Mike Walters, CEO


USA Financial Portformulas is a private money management firm that manages client portfolios by implementing formulaic strategies that have 
                    been specifically designed to remove emotion from the investing equation. Founded on the belief that the stock market has trends, our 
                    strategies seek to help investors find the right balance between taking investment risks and managing investment risk.
                

                    The 21st century has introduced new challenges for investors. In less than two decades, four distinct stock market trends materialized 
                    and challenged the emotions and risk tolerance levels of millions of Americans. Our goal is to help investors make sense of investing in 
                    today's stock market. Our clients are individuals who recognize that the stock market has changed - and that their investment strategy 
                    ought to follow suit. Our advisors recognize the importance of integrating risk management into the portfolios of their clients.

Asset management for today's stock market investor.

















USA Financial has been seen on












This is no longer your father's stock market — everything has changed"
— Mike Walters, CEO


USA Financial Portformulas is a private money management firm that manages client portfolios by implementing formulaic strategies that have 
                    been specifically designed to remove emotion from the investing equation. Founded on the belief that the stock market has trends, our 
                    strategies seek to help investors find the right balance between taking investment risks and managing investment risk.
                

                    The 21st century has introduced new challenges for investors. In less than two decades, four distinct stock market trends materialized 
                    and challenged the emotions and risk tolerance levels of millions of Americans. Our goal is to help investors make sense of investing in 
                    today's stock market. Our clients are individuals who recognize that the stock market has changed - and that their investment strategy 
                    ought to follow suit. Our advisors recognize the importance of integrating risk management into the portfolios of their clients.

USA Financial Portformulas





VIDEO: Get to know Portformulas




USA Financial Portformulas is known as the formulaic trending money manager. As an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, Portformulas 
						manages a client's portfolio through a systematic, formulaic process. Portformulas applies a strict quantitative methodology 
						to each of its models, with the goal of removing human emotion from the investment process. In short, the Portformulas strategy
					 will identify which holdings to own, how long to own them, and when to sell them.
 




Formulaic Trending 







VIDEO: Why We Use a Formulaic Approach


The first decade of the 21st century has taught us that the "Buy and Hold" philosophy requires an extensive amount of 
										time to rebuild a portfolio after significant losses in the market. As an alternative to "buy and hold," many investors 
										and financial advisors have resorted to "Market Timing" in an effort to "time" the bottoms and the tops of the market. 
										This strategy has proven to be a higher risk with greater inconsistency.
"Market Trending" is a different type of approach that shares some of the positive characteristics of both philosophies. 
										Historically, it is easy to look at charts of the stock market and point to upward trends and downward trends. It goes 
										without saying that if you could be invested in the market during the upward trends, and be repositioned in a more 
										stable investment during the downward trends, you may experience greater long term success.
The challenge is in identifying what may likely happen in the months and years to come. The goal of market trending 
										is to verify trends and act upon them. However, unlike market timing, market trending is not a reaction to the market, 
										nor is it a daily buy/sell routine in an effort to predict whether the market will go up or down next. Instead, market 
										trending seeks to identify longer term trends to potentially increase your odds for long term success. This is what 
										we do at USA Financial Portformulas. This is Formulaic Trending.




Our Process







VIDEO: How we do what we do


At the beginning of each month, the models we manage are re-evaluated in an effort to help determine what positions 
										should continue to be owned, and which positions we may wish to add. Each model that is managed has a unique a 
										specific set of criteria that is followed that determines where the client's assets will be invested. Some models 
										utilize the patented RAM® Score feature, which is a proprietary management tool utilized to help gauge the 
										overall trend of the stock market. In addition, some models use this same type of scoring feature, but apply it to 
										each individual holding every month. These unique asset management tools help to guide us in the unemotional 
										asset management decisions for each client.




Clearing/Custodial Firm 


USA Financial Portformulas has custodial relationships with three of the largest custodians in the financial industry, 
                    TD Ameritrade, 
										Trust Company of America and 
										Pershing. These three custodial 
                    firms were chosen for their advanced technology, which afford us the ability to trade in clients account and 
                    manage risk in a different way than most money managers.

USA Financial Asset Management


USA Financial Asset Management is an independent, SEC registered, full-service Registered Investment Advisor that offers a 
						unique one-of-a-kind parallel business relationship & partnership with its investment advisor representatives.
Our RIA can provide a value add beyond what the typical RIA can offer due to its affiliation with the other USA Financial 
						subsidiaries (see About USA Financial). Not only do we provide excellence 
						in the traditional RIA sense, we help our advisors to build their practice utilizing cohesively compliant and proven proprietary 
						turnkey marketing tools, services and implementation support (see Plug-n-Run)
						along with an industry leading integrated technology platform 
						(see USA Financial HQ Technology).
Advisors that are properly licensed and registered can affiliate with our RIA as an investment advisor representative (IAR). 
						In doing so, this allows them as an IAR to charge three different types of advisory fees: hourly fees, flat rate project/planning 
						fees and/or asset under management (AUM) fees.
 




AUM Trading & Custodial Services 



USA Financial Asset Management provides asset under management trading & custodial services through Pershing, LLC.
Pershing is a FINRA, NYSE & SIPC member and a 
											subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon), the nation's oldest continuously 
											operating bank, and one of the world's leading providers of securities services.
Pershing has approximately $1 trillion* in assets held in custody. Its parent company, 
											The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, has 
											approximately $27.4 trillion* in assets under custody and administration. 
											*As of September 30, 2013
NetX360 Trading Platform — With Pershing's industry leading, award winning, trading platform 
											solution reps are able to manage all their brokerage trading activities including viewing account 
											history, registration data, trade data, transfers and holdings, performance charts, and PES accounting 
											to track cost basis data. For reps using a model portfolio strategy, NetX360 is also capable of executing 
											block trades off any models that a rep creates.
NetX360 Connectivity — Interfaces with other industry leading CRMs systems and consolidated account 
											and performance tools, such as RedTail and Albridge (see USA Financial HQ Technology).
NetX360 Add-Ons — With Perishing's open architecture and leveraged access, reps can secure additional 
											discounted research, planning and investment tools at discounted pricing. These include respected 3rd-party 
											providers such as Morningstar, MoneyGuide Pro, NaviPlan, Wealth2k, Argus, Credit Suisse, Dow Jones, 
											Standard & Poor's, Thomson Reuters, MarketQ, Market Edge, ConvergEx, The Ranking Service, NASDAQ Level II 
											(request details and pricing).
USA Financial Asset Management offers its IARs two different AUM trading platforms through Pershing, a 
											traditional WRAP fee account platform and/or a WRAP account platform that allows for discretionary trading 
											for approved IARs (request details and pricing).
USA Financial Securities — RIA offers two options for execution of asset under management account trading, 
											a traditional "off-line" back-office trade ticket process and/or trade desk call or an "on-line" rep-office trade 
											process with discounted ticket charges (request details and pricing).





On-Line Advertising Review 



USA Financial Asset Management provides AdTrax, a streamlined compliance software package.
AdTrax provides an on-line submission, tracking, and approval process of IARs' advertising material.
AdTrax also archives IARs' approvals for future use and has a "sharing" mechanism for reps to share 
											their approved advertising and marketing material with other IARs should they choose to participate.





On-Line Compliance & Continuing Education 



USA Financial Asset Management provides RegEd for compliance and continuing education support.
RegEd provides our IARs on-line compliance meetings to meet regulatory requirements and keep pace 
											with industry trends, while eliminating the costs and lost time of traveling to a traditional compliance meeting.
RegEd provides our IARs firm element continuing education programs to meet additional industry requirements 
											and to be knowledgeable with industry's rules and regulations, again without the costs and need of travel.





Email Tracking & Retention 



USA Financial Asset Management provides AdvisorMail to provide regulatory email tracking and retention.
AdvisorMail helps to reduce the time IARs and their staff would normally spend manually submitting copies 
											of all email correspondence, email marketing & email advertising.





On-Line Reporting Logs & Blotters 



USA Financial Asset Management has a proprietary on-line system for IARs to utilize to maintain all the necessary 
											industry reporting logs and blotters.
Our on-line system supports reporting items such as: new account opening, additional on-going transactions/trades, 
											checks & securities, client gifts, customer complaints, marketing allowances, do not call list, and client 
											"hold" recommendations.
This system is a great support tool in the event of a regulatory audit as well as on-going business operations, 
											as our back-office support team can help you readily access any necessary reports, logs or blotters and conduct 
											specific product type or client searches on your behalf.





IARs Personal "Held-Away" Investment Accounts 



USA Financial Asset Management provides TradeSphere as an automated software program designed to ensure that 
											investment professionals are compliant with SEC regulations when trading and investing in securities within their 
											own accounts.
TradeSphere allows IARs to maintain personal investment accounts held outside of USA Financial Securities'
											advisory relationship with Pershing Advisor Solutions should you so choose.





Suitability Review 



USA Financial Asset Management does not believe that suitability can simply be handled at a high-level such as by 
											product type or institution, therefore we review and handle suitability at the individual client transaction level.
Our suitability review team and registered principals are fully licensed and cross-trained in both securities and 
											insurance products and strategies to insure that they can review the suitability of each transaction with a much 
											broader view.





"Fixed" & "Indexed" Annuity/Life Products 


Approved Outside Business

Based on the decision regarding the SEC's 151-a proposal, we do not believe indexed annuity products are securities; 
											however according to FINRA's Notice to Members 05-50, we do review each such transition for suitability to provide 
											the necessary protections to both the client and the IAR.
In order for USA Financial Asset Management to provide such suitability review with the least hindrances and 
											interruptions for the IAR and client, therefore creating the most conducive business environment, all indexed annuity 
											sales are to be transacted with our insurance wholesaler affiliate,
											USA Financial Insurance Services.
Fixed annuities and indexed/fixed life insurance are not currently required to be reviewed for suitability at the 
											RIA level.
Even though we are providing suitability on indexed annuities, there is no "haircut", or running of IAR commissions 
											through a payout grid, on either indexed annuity/life or fixed annuity/life products.





Investment Advisor Rep Payout 



USA Financial Asset Management offers its reps a competitive payout structure based on a reps affiliation level with 
											the USA Financial subsidiaries (see About USA Financial) and 
											the combined production between USA Financial Asset Management and its affiliates. In other words, USA Financial Asset Management 
											will take into account all sources of production to determine your payout, including counting your fixed/indexed 
											annuity/life production even though it doesn't actually run through the BD payout grid.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/19/2010
            

                BBB has determined that USA Financial Portformulas meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reason for Ratings

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
