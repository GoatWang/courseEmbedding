Over the past couple of years, persistently low inflation has concerned policymakers and investors. More recently, however, expectations have reached an inflection point as higher inflation will be a key risk going forward. Ron Temple, Co-Head of Multi-Asset and Head of US Equity, reviews recent inflation trends, where inflation stands today, and how to defend capital against inflation risks.
Featured Speaker






Ronald Temple, CFA
						Managing Director, Co-Head of Multi-Asset and Head of US Equity

He is also a Portfolio Manager/Analyst on various US and global equity teams. Since joining Lazard in 2001, Ron has developed a reputation as an authority on the global financial crisis and the secular changes under way in the global economy. Beyond his day-to-day responsibilities, Ron engages extensively with a wide range of Lazard's investment professionals across the equity and debt arenas to leverage the firm's insight broadly. 

Ron's unique perspectives in part arise from his broad range of previous experiences in financial services. Prior to joining Lazard, Ron was a Director and Buy-Side Equity Analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. In a previous role at Deutsche Bank, he oversaw the implementation of merger related synergies on behalf of Deutsche Bank's CEO of the Americas after Deutsche acquired Bankers Trust.

He also held a previous role in a global business manager function for Deutsche Bank's foreign exchange business. Ron has had extensive experience developing and enhancing risk management processes at Deutsche Bank, Bank of America NT&SA, and Fleet Financial. Ron began his career trading cash and derivatives in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets at Fleet Financial Group. Ron earned his Master in Public Policy from Harvard University and his Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Public Policy Studies magna cum laude from Duke University. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic Club of New York, Duke University’s Graduate School Board of Visitors and the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA). He also served as a trustee of the Link Community School in Newark, New Jersey, from 2006-2014, as a member of the Trinity Board of Visitors at Duke University from 2006-2012 and a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council from 2013 to 2015.

† The benchmark shown is a "best fit" benchmark assigned by Morningstar. Morningstar does not calculate benchmark performance for funds with a blended, or combined primary benchmark. For more information on the Fund's benchmark, please click on the prospectus link above. 
Powered by Morningstar.
Morningstar data is shown as of the most recent reporting period by each fund family. Allocations may not equal 100% and will vary overtime. Assets contained within "Other" category are not classified by Morningstar. All information presented in this tool is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice. The information is not meant to be an offer to sell or a recommendation to buy any investment product. Unless otherwise noted, performance is shown before sales charge. For more fund information, click the prospectuses button.
All information is historical and not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your shares. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. After-sales-charge returns reflect the maximum sales charge applicable to the fund, which can be found within the Table Chart. Performance may not reflect any expense limitation or subsidies currently in effect. Short-term trading fees may apply. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit Morningstar.com.
This material is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a recommendation of any specific investment product, strategy, or decision, and is not intended to suggest taking or refraining from any course of action.

Putnam, which earns fees when clients select its products and services, is not offering impartial advice in a fiduciary capacity in providing this sales and marketing material.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.


Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 



Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower. 



Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.



For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

Compare correlation to uncover hidden portfolio risk
Diversifying by market cap, geography, or investment style may not be enough.
The traditional model for building a diversified portfolio may not be adequate in today's market. Adding small-cap stocks to a large-cap portfolio, combining growth stocks with value stocks, or even supplementing a U.S.-focused fund mix with international or emerging-market equities may not create the level of diversification desired. The reason: high correlations across markets and investment styles over the past several years.
Use FundVisualizer to compare the correlation between two portfolios and fund-to-fund correlation to uncover hidden portfolio risk.
