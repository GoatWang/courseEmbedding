I Did!  Books    This book is the secret solution to that unasked question: What will you do when you stop playing sports? Whether an athlete plays in the NFL, NBA, or MLB, at the collegiate level, or in high school, what is the one thing all athletes have in common? Every single athlete will retire. But like the elephant in the room, no one ever wants to talk about that reality. Athletes spend so much time playing their sport, but there comes a day where we all transition to the next chapter in life. What is your vision, your game plan for the next phase of your life? Without one, many athletes get stuck, trapped in a past glory, unable to move on to the next amazing stage of their lives. Every single athlete gets a playbook. Whether it is a syllabus for school, a routine for the weight room, a plan for practice, or a playbook for game day. The one area an athlete needs the most coaching and an effective game plan is for what they will do away from the classroom and off the courts and field, for a much larger game. That game is: LIFE Beyond Sports Athletes all over the world are constantly running from the question, “What’s next?”    Coming SoonThe Relentless Pursuit of GREATNESS for Kindle   What’s your dream? If you could be anything, what would you be? Are you afraid to share it? Worried someone will laugh and make fun of you? You are not alone. “Your son will be the leader of a gang and dead by the time he’s sixteen. You might as well give up on him.” These are the words my mother heard at my 6th grade parent-teacher conference. At the age of twelve, my potential had already been limited. Like so many other young people in this world, I was faced with a decision. My choice was to either surrender to the opinions and expectations of others or I could tap into my passions and follow my dreams. This book is my story on how I went from a little boy with no hope, to a determined young man receiving a full athletic scholarship. I want to remind you . . . you have Permission to Dream. Thomas R.

He was married twice, had ten children, and left an enduring contribution to the Australian identity.

Personal life[edit]




Stockman's quarters on RM's property at Dry Creek


At 10 years old, Williams' family moved to Adelaide so that he and his two sisters could attend school there. School did not agree with him and so, at 13, he packed his swag and left for the land he loved. At 18 he started work as a camel driver and spent 3 years trekking through the Australian desert, living with aborigines and learning to survive the harsh conditions. During the great depression, with the lack of work, Williams returned to Adelaide where he met Thelma Ena Cummings.[1] They married and returned to the bush, living off the land in the Flinders Ranges.[2]
After his marriage broke down in the 1950s, Williams purchased 55 hectares of land at the rear of Yatala Labour Prison South Australia. He constructed a homestead, planted vineyards and thousands of roses, and ran rodeos on the floodplain of Dry Creek.[3] When the land was compulsory acquired during the time of former State Premier Sir Thomas Playford, Williams left South Australia for his Rockybar property in Eidsvold, Queensland, vowing never to return. He remarried in 1955, had four more children, and died in his home on the Darling Downs in Queensland.
Company[edit]
Early years[edit]
Williams learned his leatherworking skills from a horseman called Dollar Mick, making bridles, pack saddles and riding boots. In 1932, with his son's illness and the expense of hospital treatment, he was in need of money and began selling his saddles to Sir Sidney Kidman (a wealthy pastoralist). Williams soon had a small factory running in his father's back shed in Adelaide that rapidly expanded. To address financial problems, he became involved with the Nobles Nob gold mine, near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory.[2]
Products[edit]




R.M.Williams elastic side riding boots


Williams' most successful products are handcrafted riding boots. Williams' boots were unique when they were introduced to the market, as they consisted of a single piece of leather that was stitched at the rear of the boot (the models that featured an elastic side have been particularly popular). As of 2013, the R.M. Williams Company produces handcrafted riding boots, with the use of 70 hand processes and a single piece of leather.
Some R. M. Williams products are now made outside of Australia (mostly in China and SE Asia), this includes t-shirts, caps, seasonal shirts/shorts, polo shirts and some leather wallets.[4]
Ownership[edit]
Following the founding of the R.M. Williams company in 1932, Williams sold the business in 1988 to the old-established South Australian stock and station agents Bennett & Fisher Limited, but that business went into receivership in 1993. R.M. Williams was then placed under the ownership of long-time friend Ken Cowley (who acted in partnership with Australian business mogul Kerry Stokes) who, together with his family, presided over R.M. Williams Ltd for two decades. The company employs 600 people globally, 300 of them are based in South Australia, Australia.[5]
On 26 March 2013, the Cowley family released a statement in which the public was made aware of an intention to sell the company to a new owner for AUS$100 million sum. The statement described the sale process as an assessment of "external commercial growth and expansion plans" and the list of potential buyers included Oroton Group, Premier Investments and LVMH. As of March 2013, R.M. Williams Ltd consists of 50 retail stores and 900 stockists, and also exports to 15 countries.[5] In April 2013, R.M. Williams sold a 49.9% stake to L Capital, the private equity affiliate of LVMH.[6]
Honours[edit]
In 1985 Williams was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), for services to the outback community.[7]
In 1992 he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for service to business and to the community.[8]
In 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal.[9]
Legacy[edit]

Personal life[edit]




Stockman's quarters on RM's property at Dry Creek


At 10 years old, Williams' family moved to Adelaide so that he and his two sisters could attend school there. School did not agree with him and so, at 13, he packed his swag and left for the land he loved. At 18 he started work as a camel driver and spent 3 years trekking through the Australian desert, living with aborigines and learning to survive the harsh conditions. During the great depression, with the lack of work, Williams returned to Adelaide where he met Thelma Ena Cummings.[1] They married and returned to the bush, living off the land in the Flinders Ranges.[2]
After his marriage broke down in the 1950s, Williams purchased 55 hectares of land at the rear of Yatala Labour Prison South Australia. He constructed a homestead, planted vineyards and thousands of roses, and ran rodeos on the floodplain of Dry Creek.[3] When the land was compulsory acquired during the time of former State Premier Sir Thomas Playford, Williams left South Australia for his Rockybar property in Eidsvold, Queensland, vowing never to return. He remarried in 1955, had four more children, and died in his home on the Darling Downs in Queensland.
Company[edit]
Early years[edit]
Williams learned his leatherworking skills from a horseman called Dollar Mick, making bridles, pack saddles and riding boots. In 1932, with his son's illness and the expense of hospital treatment, he was in need of money and began selling his saddles to Sir Sidney Kidman (a wealthy pastoralist). Williams soon had a small factory running in his father's back shed in Adelaide that rapidly expanded. To address financial problems, he became involved with the Nobles Nob gold mine, near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory.[2]
Products[edit]




R.M.Williams elastic side riding boots


Williams' most successful products are handcrafted riding boots. Williams' boots were unique when they were introduced to the market, as they consisted of a single piece of leather that was stitched at the rear of the boot (the models that featured an elastic side have been particularly popular). As of 2013, the R.M. Williams Company produces handcrafted riding boots, with the use of 70 hand processes and a single piece of leather.
Some R. M. Williams products are now made outside of Australia (mostly in China and SE Asia), this includes t-shirts, caps, seasonal shirts/shorts, polo shirts and some leather wallets.[4]
Ownership[edit]
Following the founding of the R.M. Williams company in 1932, Williams sold the business in 1988 to the old-established South Australian stock and station agents Bennett & Fisher Limited, but that business went into receivership in 1993. R.M. Williams was then placed under the ownership of long-time friend Ken Cowley (who acted in partnership with Australian business mogul Kerry Stokes) who, together with his family, presided over R.M. Williams Ltd for two decades. The company employs 600 people globally, 300 of them are based in South Australia, Australia.[5]
On 26 March 2013, the Cowley family released a statement in which the public was made aware of an intention to sell the company to a new owner for AUS$100 million sum. The statement described the sale process as an assessment of "external commercial growth and expansion plans" and the list of potential buyers included Oroton Group, Premier Investments and LVMH. As of March 2013, R.M. Williams Ltd consists of 50 retail stores and 900 stockists, and also exports to 15 countries.[5] In April 2013, R.M. Williams sold a 49.9% stake to L Capital, the private equity affiliate of LVMH.[6]
Honours[edit]
In 1985 Williams was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), for services to the outback community.[7]
In 1992 he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for service to business and to the community.[8]
In 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal.[9]

By exploring the world of a hitherto obscure black harbor pilot, this book emphasizes the history of the American Revolution in the South








The World of Thomas Jeremiah
Charles Town on the Eve of the American Revolution
William R. Ryan



Description



This book profiles the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, during the two-year period leading up to the Declaration of Independence. It focuses on the dramatic hanging and burning of Thomas Jeremiah, a free black harbor pilot and firefighter accused by the patriot party of plotting a slave insurrection during the tumultous spring and summer of 1775. To examine the world of this wealthy, slave-holding African American through his trial and execution, William R. Ryan uses a wide array of letters, naval records, personal and official correspondence, memoirs, and newspapers. He shows that the black majority of the South Carolina Low Country managed to assist the British in their invasion efforts, despite patriot attempts to frighten Afro-Carolinians into passivity and submission. Although Whigs attempted, through brutality and violence, to keep their slaves from participating in the conflict, Afro-Carolinians became actively involved in the struggle between colonists and the Crown as spies, messengers, navigators and marauders. The book demonstrates that an understanding of what was going on in this vital seaport during the mid-1770s has broader implications for the study of the Atlantic world, African American history, naval history, urban race relations, labor history, and the turbulent politics of America's move toward independence.

Reviews and Awards

Finalist for the George C. Rogers Jr. Book Award



"The author's greatest success is finally putting to bed the idea that South Carolina's patriot leaders were able to conduct their revolution almost entirely as they wished. Here we see them desperately trying to manage the demands of artisans and sea captains at the same time as they struggled with the inherent contradictions that arose when a group of slaveholders joined a movement whose purpose was to seek liberty from an oppressor."--Labor
"[S]uperbly researched and argued."--The South Carolina Historical Magazine
"Ryan has created a work that gets to the heart of revolutionary movements. His study reveals the divisions and social stresses in the southern colonies, delves into the psychology of slaveholders in pre-revolutionary Charleston, highlights the dilemmas of the free and enslaved laborers in the Low Country of South Carolina, and determines the motivations of those who participated in the Revolution. As such, it will be of interest to sociologists, political scientists, cultural studies scholars, and historians alike."--Journal of Interdisciplinary History
"There have been a number of books published about colonial and revolutionary South Carolina. However, not since Richard Walsh's Charleston's Sons of Liberty (1959) has a scholar so effectively dealt with the city's underclasses and their relationship with the colony's ruling elite. Ryan not only enters the world of Thomas Jeremiah effectively, but he convinces the reader that Jeremiah and his world had a tremendous impact on the wealthiest elite in colonial America."--Walter B. Edgar, University of South Carolina
"This is an important, interesting, informative, well researched, and well-conceived book. It is concrete, using sources which bring the early years of the American Revolution in and near Charleston to life. It has several important strengths. It leaves the usual New England focus behind. It emphasizes the racial, class, and regional dimensions of the American Revolution in the Southeast, emphasizing the strength of Afro-Americans within the context of demography and their maritime skills, especially as pilots in treacherous and ever changing channels and harbor entrances."--Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, Rutgers University
"Recommended."--CHOICE
"The great strengths of this book lie in the provocative issues raised but left unresolved and in the reminder that 'the revolutionary era offered...new opportunities to challenge both the institution of chattel bondage and the allied structures of white supremacy.'"--Journal of American History
"A natural for classroom use."--Reviews in American History
