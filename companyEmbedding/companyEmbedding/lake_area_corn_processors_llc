(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We prepared the following discussion and analysis to help you better understand our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, and results of operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period of the prior year. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2016.  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains historical information, as well as forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to future events, our future financial performance, or our expected future operations and actions. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "future," "intend," "could," "hope," "predict," "target," "potential," "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only our predictions based on current information and involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the reasons described in this report and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. You should read this report and the documents that we reference in this report and have filed as exhibits completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.  Overview  Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is a South Dakota limited liability company that owns and manages its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dakota Ethanol, LLC. Dakota Ethanol, LLC owns and operates an ethanol plant located near Wentworth, South Dakota that has a nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons of ethanol per year. Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is referred to in this report as "LACP," the "company," "we," or "us." Dakota Ethanol, LLC is referred to in this report as "Dakota Ethanol" "we" "us" or the "ethanol plant."  Our revenue is derived from the sale and distribution of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. The ethanol plant currently operates in excess of its nameplate capacity, producing approximately 50 million gallons of ethanol per year. Corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market. We have engaged Renewable Products Marketing Group, Inc. ("RPMG, Inc.") to market all of the ethanol and corn oil that we produce at the ethanol plant. Further, RPMG, Inc. markets all of the distillers grains that we produce that we do not market internally to local customers.  In recent years, the ethanol industry in the United States has increased exports of ethanol and distillers grains. In January 2017, the Chinese issued final tariffs on U.S. distillers grains. The Chinese distillers grains anti-dumping tariffs range from 42.2% to 53.7% and the anti-subsidy tariffs range from 11.2% to 12%. In addition, the Chinese government increased its ethanol import tariff from 5% to 30% as of January 1, 2017. These tariffs have had a negative impact on market ethanol and distillers grains prices in the United States.  In Brazil, UNICA, the Brazilian sugarcane industry, is lobbying the Brazilian government to institute a 16% tariff on imported ethanol. Ethanol producers in Brazil are seeking a 20% tariff. To date, this tariff has not been implemented. However, Brazil is a major source of ethanol demand, and a tariff could negatively impact market ethanol prices in the United States.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Comparison of the Fiscal Quarters Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 The following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Income Statement Data Amount % Amount % Revenues $ 22,713,628 100.0 $ 21,623,796 100.0 Cost of Revenues 20,493,173 90.2 20,369,184 94.2 Gross Profit 2,220,455 9.8 1,254,612 5.8 Operating Expense 1,006,572 4.4 935,234 4.3 Income from Operations 1,213,883 5.3 319,378 1.5 Other Income 396,541 1.7 340,243 1.6 Net Income $ 1,610,424 7.1 $ 659,621 3.1  Revenues  Revenue from ethanol sales increased by approximately 11% during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately 16% during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Revenue from corn oil sales increased by approximately 28% during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016.  Ethanol  Our ethanol revenue was approximately $1,855,000 greater during our first quarter of 2017 compared to our first quarter of 2016, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase in ethanol revenue was due primarily to an increase in the average price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during our first quarter of 2017 compared to our first quarter of 2016. We sold approximately 1% fewer gallons of ethanol during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, a decrease of approximately 129,000 gallons, due to a reduction in ethanol inventory during the 2016 period. Management anticipates relatively stable production for the rest of our 2017 fiscal year.  The average price we received for our ethanol was approximately $0.15 greater per gallon during our first quarter of 2017 compared to our first quarter of 2016, an increase of approximately 12%. Management attributes this increase in ethanol prices with stronger ethanol demand in the market and improved gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our first quarter of 2017. Management anticipates that ethanol prices could be negatively impacted during our 2017 fiscal year due to uncertainty regarding ethanol exports along with anticipated increases in ethanol production in the United States. If we experience excess ethanol supplies, it could negatively impact the market price of ethanol which could decrease our profitability.  Distillers Grains  Our total distillers grains revenue was approximately 16% less during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to decreased distillers grains prices during the 2017 period. For our first quarter of 2017, we sold approximately 45% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 55% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. By comparison, for our first quarter of 2016, we sold approximately 26% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 74% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. We determine the mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains we sell based on market conditions and the relative profitability of selling the different forms of distillers grains. Management anticipates that we will maintain the current mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains going forward unless market conditions change in a way that favors one product over the other. We sold a comparable number of total tons of distillers grains during both our first quarter of 2017 and the same period of 2016.  Table of Contents  The average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately 21% less during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, a decrease of approximately $24 per ton. Management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the 2017 period with uncertainty in the export market for distillers grains due to the Chinese distillers grains tariffs. The average price we received for our modified/wet distillers grains, on a dry-equivalent basis, was approximately 11% less for our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, a decrease of approximately $14 per ton. Management attributes this decrease in modified/wet distillers grains prices with ample corn supplies in our local market along with additional distillers grains supply due to the Chinese tariffs. China has historically been the largest export market for distillers grains. Due to the Chinese tariffs, the export market for distillers grains has been significantly impacted. Management anticipates that distillers grains prices will remain lower during our 2017 fiscal year unless China reduces or eliminates these tariffs.  Corn Oil  Our total pounds of corn oil sold increased by approximately 16% during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, an increase of approximately 408,000 pounds, primarily due to decreased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment. Management anticipates that corn oil production will continue to be variable based on the total production of ethanol at our plant and by operating efficiencies we achieve at the ethanol plant. The average price we received for our corn oil was approximately 10% greater for our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, an increase of approximately $0.02 per pound. Management believes this increase in corn oil prices was primarily due to increased biodiesel demand which positively impacts corn oil prices along with soybean oil prices. Soybean oil is another feedstock which is used to produce biodiesel so when soybean oil prices increase, it typically benefits the market price of corn oil. Despite the expiration of the biodiesel blenders' tax credit, corn oil prices have remained higher. However, biodiesel production may not continue at its current level, especially if the biodiesel blenders' credit is not renewed.  Cost of Revenues  The primary raw materials we use to produce ethanol and distillers grains are corn and natural gas.  Corn  Our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately 1% less for our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to the net effect of higher corn consumption and decreased corn costs per bushel during the 2017 period.  Our average cost per bushel of corn decreased by approximately 4% for our first quarter of 2017 compared to our first quarter of 2016. Management attributes the decrease in corn prices with the large corn corp harvested in the fall of 2016 along with ample market supplies of corn pushing prices down. Management anticipates that corn prices will remain relatively lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand.  We consumed approximately 3% more bushels of corn during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Management anticipates that our corn consumption will be consistent in future quarters due to our increased production capacity.  Natural Gas  Our cost of revenues related to natural gas increased by approximately $266,000, an increase of approximately 26%, for our first quarter of 2017 compared to our first quarter of 2016. This increase was due to an increase in market natural gas prices during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 along with an increase in our natural gas usage during this period. Our average cost per MMBtu of natural gas during our first quarter of 2017 was approximately 19% greater compared to the cost per MMbtu for our first quarter of 2016. Management attributes this increase in our average natural gas costs with increased demand in other industries during the 2017 period. Management anticipates that natural gas prices will remain relatively stable. However, if natural gas production problems occur, it could result in higher natural gas prices which could negatively impact our profitability.  We used approximately 6% more MMBtus of natural gas during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due primarily to increased total production, along with more production of dried distillers grains which requires more natural gas to produce. Management anticipates that our natural gas consumption will remain at current levels for the rest of our 2017 fiscal year.  Table of Contents  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses were greater for our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due primarily to increased wages and benefits to our employees and increased costs related to advertising to fill employment vacancies.  Other Income and Expense  Our interest income was greater for our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to having more cash on hand during the 2017 period. Our income related to our investments was higher during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to increased profits we received from our investment in Guardian Hankinson, LLC. Our interest expense was lower during our first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the 2017 period.  Changes in Financial Condition for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017  Current Assets  We had less cash on hand at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due primarily to cash we used during the period for distributions to our members along with deferred corn payments. We had less accounts receivable at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to lower ethanol values at the end of March. The value of our inventory was higher at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to an increase in raw material inventory on hand. We also had less finished goods inventory as a result of the timing of our ethanol shipments in relation to the end of our fiscal quarter.  Property and Equipment  The value of our property and equipment was less at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as a result of regular depreciation of our equipment, offset by capital improvements we made during our 2017 fiscal year.  Other Assets  The value of our investments were lower at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 primarily due to a reduction in the value of our investment in Guardian Hankinson, LLC as a result of distributions we received from the investment during our 2017 fiscal year, offset by income generated by our investments during that time.  Current Liabilities  We had less outstanding checks in excess of bank balances at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to the timing of transfers between our accounts. We use our revolving loan to pay any checks which are presented for payment which exceed the cash we have available in our accounts. Our accounts payable was significantly lower at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 because our corn suppliers typically seek to defer payments for corn that is delivered at the end of the year for tax purposes, which increases our accounts payable at that time. These deferred payments were made early in our first quarter of 2017. We had a smaller liability associated with our derivative financial instruments at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to having less unrealized losses on our forward corn purchase contracts at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.  Long-Term Liabilities  Our long-term liabilities were less at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to the other liability related to long-term pledges payable.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity are cash generated from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to draw on our revolving lines of credit. Management does not anticipate that we will need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the next twelve months and management believes that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to continue our operations during that time period.  Currently, we have two revolving loans which allow us to borrow funds for working capital. These two revolving loans are described in greater detail below in the section entitled "Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Table of Contents  Condition and Results of Operations - Indebtedness." As of March 31, 2017, we had $1,000 outstanding and $18,458,000 available to be drawn on these revolving loans, after taking into account the borrowing base calculation. Management anticipates that this is sufficient to maintain our liquidity and continue our operations.  The following table shows cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (2,089,780 ) $ (1,188,031 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (103,366 ) 190,420 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (3,040,322 ) 895,957  Cash Flow From Operations. Our operating activities used more cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to cash we used for inventory purchases along with less cash we received from our investments during the 2017 period.  Cash Flow From Investing Activities. Our investing activities used more cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to capital expenditures being offset by insurance proceeds received during the 2016 period.  Cash Flow From Financing Activities. Our financing activities used more cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due primarily to more cash used for distributions during the 2017 period. In addition, during the 2016 period, the amount of checks we had issued in excess of our bank balances increased by nearly $900,000, which increased cash generated by our financing activities.  Indebtedness  Effective May 15, 2013, we entered into a comprehensive credit facility with Farm Credit Services of America, PCA and Farm Credit Services of America, FLCA (collectively "FCSA"). Our FCSA credit facility replaced our prior loans with First National Bank of Omaha. Our FCSA credit facility was originally comprised of a $10 million revolving operating line of credit (the "Operating Line") and a $5 million revolving term commitment (the "Term Revolver"). Our FCSA credit facility was amended in December 2013 to add an additional $10 million term loan (the "Term Loan"). We amended our FCSA loans on November 11, 2014, the primary purpose of which was to replace our $5 million Term Revolver and our $10 million Term Loan with a new $15 million reducing revolving loan (the "Reducing Revolving Loan"). All of our assets, including the ethanol plant and equipment, its accounts receivable and inventory, serve as collateral for our loans with FCSA.  Operating Line  The Operating Line's term was extended in our October 28, 2016 amendment to November 1, 2018. The total amount that we can draw on the Operating Line is restricted by a formula based on the amount of inventory, receivables and equity we have in certain CBOT futures positions. Interest on the Operating Line accrued at the one month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 300 basis points. There is a fee of 0.25% on the portion of the Operating Line that we are not using, which is billed quarterly. The interest rate for this loan at March 31, 2017 was 3.80%. As of March 31, 2017, we had $0 outstanding on the Operating Line and $6,459,000 available to be drawn, taking into account the borrowing base calculation.  Reducing Revolving Loan  On November 11, 2014, we executed a loan amendment with FCSA which eliminated our prior Term Loan and Term Revolver and replaced them with a new $15 million Reducing Revolving Loan. Interest accrues on the Reducing Revolving Loan at a rate of 325 basis points in excess of the one-month LIBOR and we agreed to pay a fee of 0.50% for any unused amount of the Reducing Revolving Loan. The amount we can borrow on the Reducing Revolving Loan decreases by $750,000 semi-annually starting on April 1, 2015 until the maximum balance reaches $7.5 million on October 1, 2019. The Reducing Revolving Loan matures on October 1, 2024. The interest rate for this loan at March 31, 2017 was 4.05%. As of March 31, 2017, we had $1,000 outstanding on the Reducing Revolving Loan and $11,999,000 available to be drawn.  Table of Contents  Covenants  Our credit facilities with FCSA are subject to various loan covenants. If we fail to comply with these loan covenants, FCSA can declare us to be in default of our loans. The material loan covenants applicable to our credit facilities are our working capital covenant, local net worth covenant and our debt service coverage ratio. We are required to maintain working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of at least $6 million. We are required to maintain local net worth (total assets minus total liabilities minus the value of certain investments) of at least $18 million. We are required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1.00.  As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our loan covenants. Management's current financial projections indicate that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants for the next 12 months and we expect to remain in compliance thereafter. Management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that we will fall out of compliance with our material loan covenants in the next 12 months. If we fail to comply with the terms of our credit agreements with FCSA, and FCSA refuses to waive the non-compliance, FCSA may require us to immediately repay all amounts outstanding on our loans.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Of the significant accounting policies described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following are the most critical:  Derivative Instruments  We enter into short-term forward, option and futures contracts for ethanol, corn and natural gas as a means of managing exposure to changes in commodity and energy prices. All of our derivatives are designated as non-hedge derivatives, and accordingly are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Although the contracts are considered economic hedges of specified risks, they are not designated as and accounted for as hedging instruments.  As part of our trading activity, we use futures and option contracts offered through regulated commodity exchanges to reduce our risk and we are exposed to risk of loss in the market value of inventories. To reduce that risk, we generally take positions using cash and futures contracts and options.  Unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts for corn and natural gas purchases are included as a component of cost of revenues and derivative contracts related to ethanol sales are included as a component of revenues in the accompanying financial statements. The fair values of derivative contracts are presented on the accompanying balance sheet as derivative financial instruments.  Goodwill  We record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred, the Company performs an impairment test on goodwill. The first step tests for impairment, while the second step, if necessary, measures the impairment. We perform our annual analysis on December 31 of each fiscal year.  Inventory Valuation  Inventories are generally valued using methods which approximate the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. In the valuation of inventories and purchase commitments, net realizable value is based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue from the production of ethanol and related products is recorded when title transfers to customers. Generally, ethanol and related products are shipped FOB shipping point, based on written contract terms between Dakota Ethanol and its customers. Collectability of revenue is reasonably assured based on historical evidence of collectability between Dakota Ethanol and its customers. Interest income is recognized as earned.  Table of Contents  Shipping costs incurred by the Company in the sale of ethanol, dried distiller's grains and corn oil are not specifically identifiable and as a result, revenue from the sale of those products is recorded based on the net selling price reported to the Company from the marketer.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  May 12, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We prepared the following discussion and analysis to help you better understand our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, and results of operations for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of the prior year. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the Management's Discussion and Analysis section for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015.  Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains historical information, as well as forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and relate to future events, our future financial performance, or our expected future operations and actions. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "future," "intend," "could," "hope," "predict," "target," "potential," "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are only our predictions based on current information and involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Our actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the reasons described in this report and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  The cautionary statements referred to in this section also should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that may be issued by us or persons acting on our behalf. We undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee future results, events, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.  Overview  Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is a South Dakota limited liability company that owns and manages its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dakota Ethanol, LLC. Dakota Ethanol, LLC owns and operates an ethanol plant located near Wentworth, South Dakota that has a nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons of ethanol per year. Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is referred to in this report as "LACP," the "company," "we," or "us." Dakota Ethanol, LLC is referred to in this report as "Dakota Ethanol" "we" "us" or the "ethanol plant."  Our revenue is derived from the sale and distribution of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. The ethanol plant currently operates in excess of its nameplate capacity, producing approximately 50 million gallons of ethanol per year. Corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market. We have engaged Renewable Products Marketing Group, Inc. ("RPMG, Inc.") to market all of the ethanol and corn oil that we produce at the ethanol plant. Further, RPMG, Inc. markets all of the distillers grains that we produce that we do not market internally to local customers.  We are in the process of expanding our railroad siding to accommodate shipping unit trains. We anticipate this project will be completed during our third quarter of 2016. We are using cash from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to borrow on our long-term revolving debt to finance this capital project which is expected to cost approximately $7 million.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Fiscal Quarters Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  The following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:  Table of Contents   2016 2015 Income Statement Data Amount % Amount % Revenues $ 21,944,230 100.0 $ 23,680,338 100.0 Cost of Revenues 19,104,586 87.1 19,980,671 84.4 Gross Profit 2,839,644 12.9 3,699,667 15.6 Operating Expense 860,379 3.9 883,462 3.7 Income from Operations 1,979,265 9.0 2,816,205 11.9 Other Income 550,653 2.5 1,756,184 7.4 Net Income $ 2,529,918 11.5 $ 4,572,389 19.3  Revenues  Revenue from ethanol sales decreased by approximately 5% during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately 17% during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Revenue from corn oil sales decreased by approximately 7% during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  Ethanol  Our ethanol revenue was approximately $836,000 less during our second quarter of 2016 compared to our second quarter of 2015, a decrease of approximately 5%. This decrease in ethanol revenue was due to a decrease in the total gallons of ethanol we sold during our second quarter of 2016 compared to our second quarter of 2015, along with a lower average ethanol price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during the 2016 period. We sold approximately 3% fewer gallons of ethanol during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately 409,000 gallons, due to decreased throughput at the ethanol plant. Management anticipates improved production for the rest of our 2016 fiscal year provided operating margins in the ethanol industry remain positive.  The average price we received for our ethanol was approximately $0.02 less per gallon during our second quarter of 2016 compared to our second quarter of 2015, a decrease of approximately 1%. Management attributes this decrease in ethanol prices with excess ethanol supply in the market and lower gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our second quarter of 2016. In addition, management believes the price of ethanol was negatively impacted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) renewable volume obligations under the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) which were finalized in November 2015 along with the proposed reduction in the renewable volume obligations for 2017 which were released in May 2016. These renewable volume obligations were set by the EPA lower than the statutory requirements in the RFS.  Distillers Grains  Our total distillers grains revenue was approximately 17% less during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased total tons of distillers grains we sold. For our second quarter of 2016, we sold approximately 28% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 72% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. By comparison, for our second quarter of 2015, we sold approximately 35% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 65% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. We determine the mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains we sell based on market conditions and the relative profitability of selling the different forms of distillers grains. We consume additional natural gas when we produce dried distillers grains as compared to modified/wet distillers grains which can impact the profit we generate from sales of dried distillers grains. Management anticipates that we will maintain the current mix between dried distillers grains and modified/wet distillers grains going forward unless market conditions change in a way that favors one product over the other.  The average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately 23% less during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately $34 per ton. Management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the 2016 period with uncertainty in the export market for distillers grains due to the Chinese  Table of Contents  antidumping and countervailing duty investigation. The average price we received for our modified/wet distillers grains, on a dry-equivalent basis, was approximately 8% less for our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately $11 per ton. Management attributes this decrease in modified/wet distillers grains prices with ample corn supplies in our local market along with additional distillers grains supply due to the Chinese antidumping and countervailing duty investigation. However, the local market prices did not decrease as much as the export market which resulted in a smaller decrease in our modified/wet distillers grains prices. China instituted an antisubsidy and countervailing duty investigation in January 2016 which essentially closed the Chinese market to United States produced distillers grains. Since that time, the Chinese have sporadically taken distillers grains exports but at a lower level than in the past. Management believes this has resulted in decreased worldwide demand for distillers grains which has negatively impacted domestic distillers grains prices. While we do not export a significant amount of distillers grains, the Chinese investigation has increased the domestic supply of distillers grains which has impacted local prices. In addition, there are ample corn supplies in the United States which has also impacted demand for distillers grains. Management expects distillers grains prices to continue to trade relative to the value of corn.  Corn Oil  Our total pounds of corn oil sold decreased by approximately 11% during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately 286,000 pounds, primarily due to increased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment and less total production at the ethanol plant. Management anticipates that corn oil production will return to more normal levels in the future and will continue to be variable based on the total production of ethanol at our plant and by operating efficiencies we achieve at the ethanol plant. The average price we received for our corn oil was approximately 4% greater for our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, an increase of approximately $0.01 per pound. Management believes this increase in market corn oil prices was primarily due to increased biodiesel demand which positively impacts corn oil prices. Corn oil can be used as a feedstock to produce biodiesel. The biodiesel blenders' tax credit was renewed at the end of December 2015 which management believes will positively impact corn oil demand during 2016. However, the tax credit is scheduled to expire again at the end of December 2016. As a result, this increase in corn oil demand may not continue past our 2016 fiscal year.  Cost of Revenues  Our cost of revenues for our second quarter of 2016 was slightly lower compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to decreased corn and natural gas consumption along with lower natural gas prices. The decrease in our corn consumption was due in part to decreased total production during the 2016 period along with greater efficiency in converting corn into ethanol during the 2016 period.  Our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately 6% less for our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to lower corn consumption, partially offset by increased average corn prices during the 2016 period. Our average cost per bushel of corn increased slightly for our second quarter of 2016 compared to our second quarter of 2015. Management attributes the increase in corn prices with increased market corn prices. Management anticipates that corn prices will remain relatively lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand.  We consumed approximately 7% fewer bushels of corn during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased total production at the plant during 2016 and increased efficiency at the plant which increased the number of gallons of ethanol we produced per bushel of corn ground. Management anticipates that our corn consumption will be slightly higher during our 2016 fiscal year compared to our 2015 fiscal year due to increased plant production capacity.  Our cost of revenues related to natural gas decreased by approximately $283,000, a decrease of approximately 27%, for our second quarter of 2016 compared to our second quarter of 2015. This decrease was due to a decrease in market natural gas prices during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 along with a decrease in our natural gas usage during the 2016 period. Our average cost per MMBtu of natural gas during our second quarter of 2016 was approximately 26% lower compared to the price for our second quarter of 2015. Management attributes this decrease in our average natural gas costs with generally lower energy prices and ample supplies of natural gas in the market. Management anticipates that natural gas prices will remain relatively stable. However, if natural gas production problems occur during 2016, it could result in higher natural gas prices which could negatively impact our profitability.  We used approximately 1% fewer MMBtus of natural gas during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to decreased total production. Management anticipates that our natural gas consumption will remain at current levels due to the energy efficiency projects we completed during our 2015 fiscal year.  Operating Expenses  Table of Contents  Our operating expenses were less for our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to the net effect of increased environmental costs and decreased rail car demurrage, public relations, professional fees and insurance costs.  Other Income and Expense  Our interest income was greater for our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to having more cash on hand during the 2016 period. We received a business interruption insurance payment during the 2015 period which we included in our other income related to storm damage at the plant. Our income related to our investments was less during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to reduced profitability in the ethanol industry which impacts our portion of the net income generated by our investments, including Guardian Hankinson, LLC and RPMG, because both are involved in the ethanol industry. Our interest expense was lower during our second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the 2016 period.  Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 The following table shows the results of our operations and the percentage of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and other items to total revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Income Statement Data Amount % Amount % Revenues $ 43,568,026 100.0 $ 44,395,483 100.0 Cost of Revenues 39,473,770 90.6 39,999,813 90.1 Gross Profit 4,094,256 9.4 4,395,670 9.9 Operating Expense 1,795,613 4.1 1,947,267 4.4 Income from Operations 2,298,643 5.3 2,448,403 5.5 Other Income 890,896 2.0 2,362,935 5.3 Net Income $ 3,189,539 7.3 $ 4,811,338 10.8  Revenues  Revenue from ethanol sales was comparable during our six months ended June 30, 2016 and the same period of 2015 due to the net effect of increased production and decreased average ethanol prices. Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately 5% during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Revenue from corn oil sales decreased by approximately 14% during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.  Ethanol  Our ethanol revenue was approximately $153,000 less during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to our six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of less than 1%. This decrease in ethanol revenue was due to the net effect of an increase in the total gallons of ethanol we sold during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to our six months ended June 30, 2015, offset by a decrease in the average price we received per gallon of ethanol sold during the 2016 period. We sold approximately 3% more gallons of ethanol during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, an increase of approximately 864,000 gallons, due to increased production capacity at the ethanol plant due to various plant improvement projects which were completed during our 2015 fiscal year. Management anticipates consistent production for the rest of our 2016 fiscal year provided operating margins in the ethanol industry remain positive.  The average price we received for our ethanol was approximately $0.05 less per gallon during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to our six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately 4%. Management attributes this decrease in ethanol prices with excess ethanol supply in the market and lower gasoline prices which both impacted ethanol demand and prices during our six months ended June 30, 2016. In addition, management believes the price of ethanol was negatively impacted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) renewable volume obligations under the Federal Renewable Fuels  Table of Contents  Standard (RFS) which were finalized in November 2015 along with the proposed 2017 renewable volume obligation released in May 2016. These renewable volume obligations were set by the EPA lower than the statutory requirements in the RFS.  Distillers Grains  Our total distillers grains revenue was approximately 5% less during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased average distillers grains prices, partially offset by an increase in the total tons of distillers grains we sold. For our six months ended June 30, 2016, we sold approximately 27% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 73% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form. By comparison, for our six months ended June 30, 2015, we sold approximately 31% of our total distillers grains in the dried form and approximately 69% of our total distillers grains in the modified/wet form.  The average price we received for our dried distillers grains was approximately 10% less during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately $12 per ton. Management attributes the decrease in dried distillers grains prices during the 2016 period with decreased export demand for distillers grains. The average price we received for our modified/wet distillers grains, on a dry-equivalent basis, was approximately 7% less for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately $9 per ton.  Corn Oil  Our total pounds of corn oil sold decreased by approximately 10% during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately 557,000 pounds, primarily due to increased downtime for our corn oil extraction equipment. The average price we received for our corn oil was approximately 4% less for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, a decrease of approximately $0.01 per pound. Management believes this decrease in market corn oil prices was primarily due to lower commodity and energy prices during the six month period.  Cost of Revenues  Our cost of revenues for our six months ended June 30, 2016 was slightly lower compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased corn consumption, along with lower average corn and natural gas prices. This decrease in corn consumption was primarily due to improved yields during the 2016 period.  Our cost of revenues relating to corn was approximately 3% less for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased corn consumption and average corn prices per bushel during the 2016 period. Our average cost per bushel of corn decreased by approximately 1% for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to our six months ended June 30, 2015. Management attributes the decrease in corn prices with a strong corn harvest in the fall of 2015 along with increased corn carryover and relatively stable corn demand. Management anticipates that corn prices will remain lower into the foreseeable future as corn is plentiful with relatively stable corn demand. We consumed approximately 2% less bushels of corn during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to decreased production and improved corn to ethanol yields during the 2016 period.  Our cost of revenues related to natural gas decreased by approximately $866,000, a decrease of approximately 33%, for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. This decrease was due to a decrease in market natural gas prices during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 along with a decrease in our natural gas usage during the 2016 period. Our average cost per MMBtu of natural gas during our six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately 32% lower compared to the price for our six months ended June 30, 2015. Management attributes this decrease in our average natural gas costs with generally lower energy prices and ample supplies of natural gas in the market. We used approximately 1% fewer MMBtus of natural gas during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to energy efficiency improvements in the plant along with decreased production.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses were less for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to the net effect of increased environmental costs and decreased rail car demurrage, public relations, professional fees and insurance costs.  Other Income and Expense  Table of Contents  Our interest income was less for our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to having less cash on hand during the 2016 period. We received a business interruption insurance payment during the 2015 period which we included in our other income related to storm damage at the plant. Our income related to our investments was less during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to reduced profitability in the ethanol industry which impacts our portion of the net income generated by our investments, including Guardian Hankinson, LLC and RPMG, because both are involved in the ethanol industry. Our interest expense was lower during our six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 due to having less borrowings outstanding on our loans during the 2016 period.  Changes in Financial Condition for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016  Current Assets  We had less cash on hand at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We used cash during our second quarter of 2016 to pay a distribution to our members. At the end of the year, many of our corn suppliers defer corn payments until the next year which results in additional cash we have available. We had more accounts receivable at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to the timing of our payments from our marketer. We had less other receivables at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to payment of insurance claim receivables received in the first quarter of 2016. The value of our inventory was comparable at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 with a similar quantity and market price for our raw material and finished goods inventory. Due to volatility in the corn market, we had a larger unrealized gain on our derivative instruments at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 which increased our current assets.  Property and Equipment  The value of our property and equipment was greater at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 as a result of capital improvements we made during our 2016 fiscal year, partially offset by regular depreciation of our equipment. We are in the process of completing railroad track improvements which are included in our construction in progress.  Other Assets  The value of our investments were lower at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to the reduction in the value of our investment in Guardian Hankinson, LLC, Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC and Lawrenceville Tank, LLC as a result of distributions we received from them during our 2016 fiscal year, offset by income generated by our investments since that time.  Current Liabilities  We had more outstanding checks in excess of bank balances at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to the timing of transfers between our accounts and increased corn payments following the end of our 2015 fiscal year. We use our revolving loan to pay any checks which are presented for payment which exceed the cash we have available in our accounts. Our accounts payable was significantly lower at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 because our corn suppliers typically seek to defer payments for corn that is delivered at the end of the year for tax purposes, which increases our accounts payable at that time. These deferred payments were made early in our first quarter of 2016. We had a greater liability associated with our derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to having more unrealized losses on our forward corn purchase contracts at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to market volatility.  Long-Term Liabilities  Our long-term liabilities were less at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due to the other liability related to our TIF guarantee.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity are cash generated from our continuing operations and amounts we have available to draw on our revolving lines of credit. Management does not anticipate that we will need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the next twelve months and management believes that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to continue our operations during that time period.  Currently, we have two revolving loans which allow us to borrow funds for . . .  Aug 12, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
