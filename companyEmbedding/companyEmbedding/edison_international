History[edit]
The company was first incorporated in 1909 as Southern California Edison Company after Southern California acquired the assets of Edison Electric Company; it was known as Southern California Edison until 1996 when it adopted its current name in recognition of its growing business abroad and in other industry sectors. Edison first became a holding company in 1988 when it made a small change to its original name, becoming known as SCEcorp.
In 2001 Edison's main holding, Southern California Edison faced bankruptcy after a state senate bill regarding financial assistance came up short (by $1 billion).[2]
On August 6, 2002, Edison International recorded core earnings per share of 56 cents in the second quarter of 2002.[3]
Recent moves[edit]
In November 2010 Edison sold its 48% interest in the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico (units 4 and 5 while units 1,2 and 3 will be closed because of being older) for $294 million to Pinnacle West Capital Corp (of Arizona Public Service). The move was the direct result of a new California law requiring utility companies to exit coal-fired power production (even the renewing of contracts is disallowed), and forces Edison to purchase more power from the market.[4]
San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 shut in early January 2012 for refueling and replacement of the reactor vessel head. Both reactors at San Onofre have been shut since January 2012 due to premature wear found on tubes in massive steam generators installed in 2010 and 2011.
In April 2012, in a sign of mounting concern over the shutdown, the top U.S. nuclear official, Gregory Jaczko, toured the facility with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican. In June, 2013, the company announced it would permanently shut down operations at the plant, the beginning of a multi-year decommissioning process at the site.
Energy production mix[edit]
At least 34% of the fuel Southern California Edison uses to generate power comes from clean energy (half of that nuclear power, the other half renewable energy sources ranging from biomass to wind).[5] The group is a major player in Southern California where it provides 13 million people with electricity.[6]
Southern California Edison began to focus on renewable energy in 1980.

Our Views: Practical Energy Policy for the Future





When it comes to public policy on energy, legislation formed today will exert implications well into the future. While our focus as a company is to safely produce and deliver reliable and affordable electricity, we’re also working to help policymakers create informed, practical public policy for California and our nation, based on a thorough understanding of associated costs and tradeoffs.










"All of us in the energy arena need to work together as never before to build a system that benefits all customers. It’s imperative that we get this right."

— Pedro J. Pizarro, CEO and President, Edison International
 






Extending the Benefits of the Clean, Modern Grid to the Transportation Sector

Using clean electric power as a transportation fuel is an effective way to accelerate attainment of California’s environmental goals. Electric vehicles currently reduce greenhouse gases by more than 70 percent and smog-producing air pollutants by 85 percent compared to gas-powered cars. As more renewable resources are added to the grid, electric vehicles will increasingly benefit the environment.
The natural role for electric utilities in electric transportation is delivering clean electricity to customers to fuel their EVs. New electricity infrastructure and a modernized grid will support the growth and integration of EVs; however, we must support more chargers that deliver clean and reliable electric fuel to EVs.
We have just 13 years until 2030 – the date when California has committed to meet the next phase of its GHG reduction goals. If the state, utilities, and other stakeholders do not act now, time will quickly run out to achieve these laudable GHG reduction goals. These parties cannot work alone. They must be willing to collaborate and share lessons learned, while developing programs to encourage the adoption of EVs. Given the real world timing constraints of bringing millions of new EVs on the road to meet the state’s environmental objectives, there must be a willingness to try new methods, fail fast, and move on.






WHITE PAPER



Transportation Electrification: Reducing Emissions, Driving Innovation



Transportation Electrification (PDF)














Through our Charge Ready program, we are ensuring that there are more places for passenger EVs to charge away from home. We are now proposing to use this approach for commercial and heavy duty vehicles, promoting electrification of freight transportation and people movement. These projects will benefit all SCE customers, with a particular focus on “disadvantaged communities” — areas that are disproportionately affected by pollution and economic hardship, often located along transportation corridors.

Key Trends Driving Change in the Electric Power Industry

“The successful transition to the next generation electric power system requires thinking about our industry in entirely new ways.” — Pedro J. Pizarro, CEO and President, Edison International


Foreword by Pedro J. Pizarro, CEO and President, Edison International - Key Trends Driving Change in the Electric Power Industry Volume II, June 2016 (PDF)
Key Trends Driving Change in the Electric Power Industry Volume II, June 2016 (PDF)








OUR PERSPECTIVE: GRID OF THE FUTURE

Transforming the Power Grid to Accommodate New Energy Technologies
Electricity customers today want choice and flexibility in how they manage their energy. This is evident in the growth of distributed energy resources for personal use, such as private rooftop solar, energy storage, and electric vehicles. In these short clips Edison International CEO and President Pedro Pizarro explains why energy companies must transform the existing local power grid into a “plug and play” platform that accommodates and integrates these new energy technologies.

































Technology is Transforming the Grid
Technology is giving customers choices about what devices they need or want to plug into the grid, and it’s the utilities job to facilitate those choices.






Customer Adoption of Solar is Growing Exponentially
The state of California has about 25 percent of the nation’s distributed energy resources. SCE is helping customers install private solar at a rate of more than 5,000 per month.






The Grid Must Be Modernized to Facilitate Customer Choice
The grid was designed for one-way flow of power from generator to customer. It must be converted to a two-way flow to enable new energy technologies.






Modernizing the Grid Requires Major Investment
SCE is investing about $4 billion a year to make the grid smarter and more robust. SCE's road map for building the grid of the future has been filed with California state regulators.






A Modern Grid Will Require New Business Models
Utilities are engaging with regulators on questions such as: “Who should operate the grid?” Our view is that the utility is the natural choice to be the distribution system operator.






All Stakeholders Must Work Together on Building the Grid of the Future
Technology companies will need to keep improving cost and performance. Regulators will need to ensure fairness in rates and cost sharing. Utilities will need to undergo a culture change. We all have to work together to get this right.

Edison International is a public utility holding company based in Rosemead, California. Its subsidiaries include Southern California Edison, and un-regulated non-utility business assets Edison Energy. Edison's roots trace back to Holt & Knupps, a company founded in 1886 as a provider of street lights in Visalia, California.

History[edit]
The company was first incorporated in 1909 as Southern California Edison Company after Southern California acquired the assets of Edison Electric Company; it was known as Southern California Edison until 1996 when it adopted its current name in recognition of its growing business abroad and in other industry sectors. Edison first became a holding company in 1988 when it made a small change to its original name, becoming known as SCEcorp.
In 2001 Edison's main holding, Southern California Edison faced bankruptcy after a state senate bill regarding financial assistance came up short (by $1 billion).[2]
On August 6, 2002, Edison International recorded core earnings per share of 56 cents in the second quarter of 2002.[3]
Recent moves[edit]
In November 2010 Edison sold its 48% interest in the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico (units 4 and 5 while units 1,2 and 3 will be closed because of being older) for $294 million to Pinnacle West Capital Corp (of Arizona Public Service). The move was the direct result of a new California law requiring utility companies to exit coal-fired power production (even the renewing of contracts is disallowed), and forces Edison to purchase more power from the market.[4]
San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 shut in early January 2012 for refueling and replacement of the reactor vessel head. Both reactors at San Onofre have been shut since January 2012 due to premature wear found on tubes in massive steam generators installed in 2010 and 2011.
In April 2012, in a sign of mounting concern over the shutdown, the top U.S. nuclear official, Gregory Jaczko, toured the facility with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican. In June, 2013, the company announced it would permanently shut down operations at the plant, the beginning of a multi-year decommissioning process at the site.
Energy production mix[edit]
At least 34% of the fuel Southern California Edison uses to generate power comes from clean energy (half of that nuclear power, the other half renewable energy sources ranging from biomass to wind).[5] The group is a major player in Southern California where it provides 13 million people with electricity.[6]
Southern California Edison began to focus on renewable energy in 1980.

Edison International is a public utility holding company based in Rosemead, California. Its subsidiaries include Southern California Edison, and un-regulated non-utility business assets Edison Energy. Edison's roots trace back to Holt & Knupps, a company founded in 1886 as a provider of street lights in Visalia, California.

History[edit]
The company was first incorporated in 1909 as Southern California Edison Company after Southern California acquired the assets of Edison Electric Company; it was known as Southern California Edison until 1996 when it adopted its current name in recognition of its growing business abroad and in other industry sectors. Edison first became a holding company in 1988 when it made a small change to its original name, becoming known as SCEcorp.
In 2001 Edison's main holding, Southern California Edison faced bankruptcy after a state senate bill regarding financial assistance came up short (by $1 billion).[2]
On August 6, 2002, Edison International recorded core earnings per share of 56 cents in the second quarter of 2002.[3]
Recent moves[edit]
In November 2010 Edison sold its 48% interest in the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico (units 4 and 5 while units 1,2 and 3 will be closed because of being older) for $294 million to Pinnacle West Capital Corp (of Arizona Public Service). The move was the direct result of a new California law requiring utility companies to exit coal-fired power production (even the renewing of contracts is disallowed), and forces Edison to purchase more power from the market.[4]
San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 shut in early January 2012 for refueling and replacement of the reactor vessel head. Both reactors at San Onofre have been shut since January 2012 due to premature wear found on tubes in massive steam generators installed in 2010 and 2011.
In April 2012, in a sign of mounting concern over the shutdown, the top U.S. nuclear official, Gregory Jaczko, toured the facility with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican. In June, 2013, the company announced it would permanently shut down operations at the plant, the beginning of a multi-year decommissioning process at the site.
Energy production mix[edit]
At least 34% of the fuel Southern California Edison uses to generate power comes from clean energy (half of that nuclear power, the other half renewable energy sources ranging from biomass to wind).[5] The group is a major player in Southern California where it provides 13 million people with electricity.[6]
Southern California Edison began to focus on renewable energy in 1980.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
