Early life and family[edit]
Leavitt was born in Cedar City, Utah, the son of Phyllis Anne (Okerlund) and Dixie Lorraine Leavitt.[2][3] Leavitt graduated with a degree in business from Southern Utah University and married Jacalyn Smith. They have five children.
Leavitt is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Leavitt is a descendant of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, and a direct descendant of Dudley Leavitt, a Mormon pioneer.
Early career[edit]
Leavitt's business career started with his joining The Leavitt Group, a regional insurance company founded by his father, Dixie L. Leavitt. He rose to become the company's president and CEO and presided over a period of expansion. He was subsequently appointed to the boards of directors of numerous local and regional companies, including Utah Power and Light, as well as a member of the Utah State Board of Regents. As a regent, he helped oversee Utah's nine public colleges and universities. For four years, he was chair of Southern Utah University's board of trustees.[4]
In 1976, Leavitt assisted his father, then a Utah state senator, in an unsuccessful campaign for governor. He worked on a number of U.S. Senate campaigns through the 1980s for Jake Garn and Orrin Hatch.[4]
Government service[edit]
Governor of Utah[edit]

Leavitt first ran for governor in 1992. He had tough competition in the Republican Party primary from Richard Eyre who had more delegates vote for him at the state Republican convention. He defeated Independent Party candidate Merrill Cook and Democratic nominee Stewart Hanson in the general election, becoming the 14th Governor of the State of Utah.
A holiday fire shortly before noon on December 15, 1993, destroyed much of the Utah Governor's Mansion, but spared the lives of the first family and staff (Jacalyn Leavitt and some members of the family and staff were in the home at the time of the fire).
Leavitt was re-elected in 1996 with the largest vote total in state history. While Governor, he and Roy Romer of Colorado were the two key founders of Western Governors University in 1997, one of the first exclusively online schools in the nation. In addition to Leavitt and Romer, 17 other governors signed legislation creating the school as a non-profit private university.
Leavitt came under strong criticism in 1998, while Governor, when asked why polygamy is not often prosecuted, he stated he was not sure, however "it may fall under religious freedoms." He was later forced to backpedal and claimed that polygamy should be against the law.[5]
In 2000, Leavitt became only the second governor in Utah history to be re-elected to a third term. As governor, he held leadership positions in national and regional organizations, such as the Council of State Governments, over which he presided for a year.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On August 11, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Leavitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency at a press conference in Aurora, Colorado. He was confirmed on October 28, 2003 by a vote of 88–8 in the United States Senate. On November 5, having resigned the governorship, Leavitt was sworn in as the 10th Administrator of the EPA.
At the Environmental Protection Agency he implemented higher standards for ozone, diesel fuels and other air pollutants. He organized and managed a collaboration to develop a federal plan to clean up the Great Lakes.
Secretary of Health and Human Services[edit]
On December 13, 2004, Leavitt was nominated by Bush to succeed Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 26, 2005.
Leavitt was commonly known for his advocating that Medicare was drifting toward disaster. He claimed Congress neglected his notions.
In June 2006, Leavitt came under criticism for using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Gulfstream III Emergency Response aircraft to, primarily, promote the newly reformed Medicare plan. Critics argue that Leavitt irresponsibly used the aircraft beginning in January 2006, logging over $700,000 worth of flight time in the 14-seat private jet. Leavitt’s office maintains that the use of the aircraft was necessary and legal since the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his use of the aircraft, and commercial services could not meet the deadlines required by his engagements.
Leavitt has described the avian influenza virus as the most serious threat to American security. Secretary Leavitt cited the work of the World Health Organization's Dr. Michael McCoy as the most compelling scientific work into the avian flu threat. This encouraged Secretary Leavitt to mobilize the nation’s pandemic preparedness and led to the reconfiguring of the nation’s medical emergency plans.
Leavitt also served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. In August 2007, Leavitt became the first cabinet-level blogger in U.S. history.[citation needed]
Advisor to Mitt Romney[edit]
In August 2012, Politico reported Leavitt to be "creating a government-in-waiting plan for Mitt Romney" and "a lock for... White House chief of staff or Treasury secretary" in a potential Romney administration.[6]
Leavitt Foundation[edit]

Leavitt's family charitable foundation, the Dixie and Anne Leavitt Foundation, was established by the Leavitt family in 2000, and the family has donated nearly $9 million of assets to it since. It has provided them with tax write-offs for the donated assets. About a third of the foundation's assets have been loaned back to family businesses, such as a $332,000 loan to Leavitt Land and Investment Inc., in which Leavitt has an interest. According to a 2006 National Public Radio report, these loans were legal because they were made at market rates.[7] A month following the NPR report, Congress made such transactions illegal.
The same NPR report revealed that nearly $500,000 in charitable contributions provided to the Southern Utah Foundation were used for housing scholarships to Southern Utah University.[citation needed] The scholarships were subsequently used to place students in the Cedar Development Co., a Leavitt family business, with the money used to pay the students' rent. NPR's investigation found that the arrangement was legal and that the Leavitts did not profit from the arrangement. Although legal, the procedure, called "round-tripping" in philanthropic circles, has garnered criticism as lacking in the spirit of philanthropy.[7] The report also stated that Leavitt was not directly involved in the foundation's operations.[citation needed]
Total charitable grants from the foundation during its first six years were $1,468,055. The foundation's principal beneficiaries have been Southern Utah University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other beneficiaries have included arts, educational and humanitarian organizations, including the Leavitt family genealogical society.[citation needed]
Leavitt Partners[edit]
Leavitt Partners is a consulting firm created by Michael O. Leavitt to advise clients in the health care and food safety sectors. The firm is also involved in helping the states implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "ObamaCare."[8]

Early life and family[edit]
Leavitt was born in Cedar City, Utah, the son of Phyllis Anne (Okerlund) and Dixie Lorraine Leavitt.[2][3] Leavitt graduated with a degree in business from Southern Utah University and married Jacalyn Smith. They have five children.
Leavitt is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Leavitt is a descendant of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, and a direct descendant of Dudley Leavitt, a Mormon pioneer.
Early career[edit]
Leavitt's business career started with his joining The Leavitt Group, a regional insurance company founded by his father, Dixie L. Leavitt. He rose to become the company's president and CEO and presided over a period of expansion. He was subsequently appointed to the boards of directors of numerous local and regional companies, including Utah Power and Light, as well as a member of the Utah State Board of Regents. As a regent, he helped oversee Utah's nine public colleges and universities. For four years, he was chair of Southern Utah University's board of trustees.[4]
In 1976, Leavitt assisted his father, then a Utah state senator, in an unsuccessful campaign for governor. He worked on a number of U.S. Senate campaigns through the 1980s for Jake Garn and Orrin Hatch.[4]
Government service[edit]
Governor of Utah[edit]

Leavitt first ran for governor in 1992. He had tough competition in the Republican Party primary from Richard Eyre who had more delegates vote for him at the state Republican convention. He defeated Independent Party candidate Merrill Cook and Democratic nominee Stewart Hanson in the general election, becoming the 14th Governor of the State of Utah.
A holiday fire shortly before noon on December 15, 1993, destroyed much of the Utah Governor's Mansion, but spared the lives of the first family and staff (Jacalyn Leavitt and some members of the family and staff were in the home at the time of the fire).
Leavitt was re-elected in 1996 with the largest vote total in state history. While Governor, he and Roy Romer of Colorado were the two key founders of Western Governors University in 1997, one of the first exclusively online schools in the nation. In addition to Leavitt and Romer, 17 other governors signed legislation creating the school as a non-profit private university.
Leavitt came under strong criticism in 1998, while Governor, when asked why polygamy is not often prosecuted, he stated he was not sure, however "it may fall under religious freedoms." He was later forced to backpedal and claimed that polygamy should be against the law.[5]
In 2000, Leavitt became only the second governor in Utah history to be re-elected to a third term. As governor, he held leadership positions in national and regional organizations, such as the Council of State Governments, over which he presided for a year.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On August 11, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Leavitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency at a press conference in Aurora, Colorado. He was confirmed on October 28, 2003 by a vote of 88–8 in the United States Senate. On November 5, having resigned the governorship, Leavitt was sworn in as the 10th Administrator of the EPA.
At the Environmental Protection Agency he implemented higher standards for ozone, diesel fuels and other air pollutants. He organized and managed a collaboration to develop a federal plan to clean up the Great Lakes.
Secretary of Health and Human Services[edit]
On December 13, 2004, Leavitt was nominated by Bush to succeed Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 26, 2005.
Leavitt was commonly known for his advocating that Medicare was drifting toward disaster. He claimed Congress neglected his notions.
In June 2006, Leavitt came under criticism for using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Gulfstream III Emergency Response aircraft to, primarily, promote the newly reformed Medicare plan. Critics argue that Leavitt irresponsibly used the aircraft beginning in January 2006, logging over $700,000 worth of flight time in the 14-seat private jet. Leavitt’s office maintains that the use of the aircraft was necessary and legal since the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his use of the aircraft, and commercial services could not meet the deadlines required by his engagements.
Leavitt has described the avian influenza virus as the most serious threat to American security. Secretary Leavitt cited the work of the World Health Organization's Dr. Michael McCoy as the most compelling scientific work into the avian flu threat. This encouraged Secretary Leavitt to mobilize the nation’s pandemic preparedness and led to the reconfiguring of the nation’s medical emergency plans.
Leavitt also served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. In August 2007, Leavitt became the first cabinet-level blogger in U.S. history.[citation needed]
Advisor to Mitt Romney[edit]
In August 2012, Politico reported Leavitt to be "creating a government-in-waiting plan for Mitt Romney" and "a lock for... White House chief of staff or Treasury secretary" in a potential Romney administration.[6]
Leavitt Foundation[edit]

Leavitt's family charitable foundation, the Dixie and Anne Leavitt Foundation, was established by the Leavitt family in 2000, and the family has donated nearly $9 million of assets to it since. It has provided them with tax write-offs for the donated assets. About a third of the foundation's assets have been loaned back to family businesses, such as a $332,000 loan to Leavitt Land and Investment Inc., in which Leavitt has an interest. According to a 2006 National Public Radio report, these loans were legal because they were made at market rates.[7] A month following the NPR report, Congress made such transactions illegal.
The same NPR report revealed that nearly $500,000 in charitable contributions provided to the Southern Utah Foundation were used for housing scholarships to Southern Utah University.[citation needed] The scholarships were subsequently used to place students in the Cedar Development Co., a Leavitt family business, with the money used to pay the students' rent. NPR's investigation found that the arrangement was legal and that the Leavitts did not profit from the arrangement. Although legal, the procedure, called "round-tripping" in philanthropic circles, has garnered criticism as lacking in the spirit of philanthropy.[7] The report also stated that Leavitt was not directly involved in the foundation's operations.[citation needed]
Total charitable grants from the foundation during its first six years were $1,468,055. The foundation's principal beneficiaries have been Southern Utah University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other beneficiaries have included arts, educational and humanitarian organizations, including the Leavitt family genealogical society.[citation needed]
Leavitt Partners[edit]
Leavitt Partners is a consulting firm created by Michael O. Leavitt to advise clients in the health care and food safety sectors. The firm is also involved in helping the states implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "ObamaCare."[8]

Early life and family[edit]
Leavitt was born in Cedar City, Utah, the son of Phyllis Anne (Okerlund) and Dixie Lorraine Leavitt.[2][3] Leavitt graduated with a degree in business from Southern Utah University and married Jacalyn Smith. They have five children.
Leavitt is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Leavitt is a descendant of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, and a direct descendant of Dudley Leavitt, a Mormon pioneer.
Early career[edit]
Leavitt's business career started with his joining The Leavitt Group, a regional insurance company founded by his father, Dixie L. Leavitt. He rose to become the company's president and CEO and presided over a period of expansion. He was subsequently appointed to the boards of directors of numerous local and regional companies, including Utah Power and Light, as well as a member of the Utah State Board of Regents. As a regent, he helped oversee Utah's nine public colleges and universities. For four years, he was chair of Southern Utah University's board of trustees.[4]
In 1976, Leavitt assisted his father, then a Utah state senator, in an unsuccessful campaign for governor. He worked on a number of U.S. Senate campaigns through the 1980s for Jake Garn and Orrin Hatch.[4]
Government service[edit]
Governor of Utah[edit]

Leavitt first ran for governor in 1992. He had tough competition in the Republican Party primary from Richard Eyre who had more delegates vote for him at the state Republican convention. He defeated Independent Party candidate Merrill Cook and Democratic nominee Stewart Hanson in the general election, becoming the 14th Governor of the State of Utah.
A holiday fire shortly before noon on December 15, 1993, destroyed much of the Utah Governor's Mansion, but spared the lives of the first family and staff (Jacalyn Leavitt and some members of the family and staff were in the home at the time of the fire).
Leavitt was re-elected in 1996 with the largest vote total in state history. While Governor, he and Roy Romer of Colorado were the two key founders of Western Governors University in 1997, one of the first exclusively online schools in the nation. In addition to Leavitt and Romer, 17 other governors signed legislation creating the school as a non-profit private university.
Leavitt came under strong criticism in 1998, while Governor, when asked why polygamy is not often prosecuted, he stated he was not sure, however "it may fall under religious freedoms." He was later forced to backpedal and claimed that polygamy should be against the law.[5]
In 2000, Leavitt became only the second governor in Utah history to be re-elected to a third term. As governor, he held leadership positions in national and regional organizations, such as the Council of State Governments, over which he presided for a year.
EPA Administrator[edit]
On August 11, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Leavitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency at a press conference in Aurora, Colorado. He was confirmed on October 28, 2003 by a vote of 88–8 in the United States Senate. On November 5, having resigned the governorship, Leavitt was sworn in as the 10th Administrator of the EPA.
At the Environmental Protection Agency he implemented higher standards for ozone, diesel fuels and other air pollutants. He organized and managed a collaboration to develop a federal plan to clean up the Great Lakes.
Secretary of Health and Human Services[edit]
On December 13, 2004, Leavitt was nominated by Bush to succeed Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 26, 2005.
Leavitt was commonly known for his advocating that Medicare was drifting toward disaster. He claimed Congress neglected his notions.
In June 2006, Leavitt came under criticism for using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Gulfstream III Emergency Response aircraft to, primarily, promote the newly reformed Medicare plan. Critics argue that Leavitt irresponsibly used the aircraft beginning in January 2006, logging over $700,000 worth of flight time in the 14-seat private jet. Leavitt’s office maintains that the use of the aircraft was necessary and legal since the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his use of the aircraft, and commercial services could not meet the deadlines required by his engagements.
Leavitt has described the avian influenza virus as the most serious threat to American security. Secretary Leavitt cited the work of the World Health Organization's Dr. Michael McCoy as the most compelling scientific work into the avian flu threat. This encouraged Secretary Leavitt to mobilize the nation’s pandemic preparedness and led to the reconfiguring of the nation’s medical emergency plans.
Leavitt also served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. In August 2007, Leavitt became the first cabinet-level blogger in U.S. history.[citation needed]
Advisor to Mitt Romney[edit]
In August 2012, Politico reported Leavitt to be "creating a government-in-waiting plan for Mitt Romney" and "a lock for... White House chief of staff or Treasury secretary" in a potential Romney administration.[6]
Leavitt Foundation[edit]

Leavitt's family charitable foundation, the Dixie and Anne Leavitt Foundation, was established by the Leavitt family in 2000, and the family has donated nearly $9 million of assets to it since. It has provided them with tax write-offs for the donated assets. About a third of the foundation's assets have been loaned back to family businesses, such as a $332,000 loan to Leavitt Land and Investment Inc., in which Leavitt has an interest. According to a 2006 National Public Radio report, these loans were legal because they were made at market rates.[7] A month following the NPR report, Congress made such transactions illegal.
The same NPR report revealed that nearly $500,000 in charitable contributions provided to the Southern Utah Foundation were used for housing scholarships to Southern Utah University.[citation needed] The scholarships were subsequently used to place students in the Cedar Development Co., a Leavitt family business, with the money used to pay the students' rent. NPR's investigation found that the arrangement was legal and that the Leavitts did not profit from the arrangement. Although legal, the procedure, called "round-tripping" in philanthropic circles, has garnered criticism as lacking in the spirit of philanthropy.[7] The report also stated that Leavitt was not directly involved in the foundation's operations.[citation needed]
Total charitable grants from the foundation during its first six years were $1,468,055. The foundation's principal beneficiaries have been Southern Utah University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other beneficiaries have included arts, educational and humanitarian organizations, including the Leavitt family genealogical society.[citation needed]
Leavitt Partners[edit]
Leavitt Partners is a consulting firm created by Michael O. Leavitt to advise clients in the health care and food safety sectors. The firm is also involved in helping the states implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "ObamaCare."[8]

1
Securing FDA approval for a generic drug is generally a much simpler and faster process than securing approval for a "pioneer" drug. Instead of directly demonstrating the drug's safety and efficacy, see 21 U.S.C. § 355(a), manufacturers of the generic file an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") that need show only that the generic is the same as the pioneer drug along certain dimensions. See § 355(j)(2)(A)(i)-(viii). This case concerns FDA's decision to change the dosage forms, labeling, and established names associated with appellant Novartis's pioneer drug in ways that would ease the path for competing generic drugs. Novartis raises a number of procedural and substantive challenges to FDA's changes. The district court rejected all and we affirm.


2
* * * * * *


3
The fastest route to FDA approval requires an ANDA to demonstrate not only that a generic drug has the same active ingredient(s) as the pioneer drug and is bioequivalent to it, i.e., roughly speaking, is absorbed at the same rate and to the same extent when administered under similar conditions, but also that the generic and pioneer drugs have the same dosage form and labeling. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(ii)-(v). The latter two requirements are at issue in this case.


4
"Dosage forms" are categories that relate to such matters as a drug's appearance, physical form, and method of administration. The FDA assigns each drug a dosage form; currently there are 77 such categories. See FDA, APPROVED DRUG PRODUCTS WITH THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE EVALUATIONS Appx. C (25th ed.2005). Some of the dosage forms are quite broad (for example, "elixir" or "tablet, chewable"), while others are relatively narrow (for example, "injectable, lipid complex"). Id. If a generic manufacturer cannot show that its drug has the same dosage form as the pioneer drug, it can still obtain FDA approval, but the process is more arduous: the manufacturer may use an abbreviated application only if it first files a "suitability petition" and the FDA grants it permission to file an ANDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(C); 21 C.F.R. § 314.93. Even if the drug is ultimately approved, the difference in dosage form will preclude the generic from being designated therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer drug, and will thus disqualify the generic from being considered automatically substitutable for the pioneer drug under various state pharmacy laws. See Warner-Lambert v. Shalala, 202 F.3d 326, 327-28 (D.C.Cir.2000).


5
To avoid charges of misbranding, the labels of prescription drugs must include certain pieces of information displayed in a particular way. See 21 U.S.C. § 352. Thus the requirement that a generic have the same labeling as the pioneer drug incorporates several additional requirements, two of which are relevant to this case.1 First, FDA requires the labels to contain the pioneer drug's dosage form, see 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(a)(1)(ii), so the same-label requirement reincorporates the requirement that the generic drug share the pioneer drug's dosage form. Second, the FDA requires prescription drug labels to include the drug's established name, see 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(a)(1)(i), which is a nonproprietary name assigned to the drug by the FDA. The rule mandating inclusion of the established nonproprietary name on the label means that a generic drug must have the same nonproprietary name as the pioneer drug for the FDA to approve the generic drug through the ANDA process. We turn later to the statutory framework for assigning such names.


6
Novartis markets cyclosporine drug products that are widely prescribed to prevent organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart transplants. (These drugs were developed by Novartis's predecessor, Sandoz Corp. For simplicity, we refer to both corporations as Novartis.) It markets two types of cyclosporine drugs under the proprietary names Sandimmune and Neoral. Both are available as capsules and as solutions, and both form emulsions when they come into contact with aqueous liquids. The difference is the size of the droplets in which the active ingredient is dispersed. Sandimmune forms a macroemulsion and disperses cyclosporine in larger droplets than does Neoral, which forms a microemulsion. The smaller size of the droplets in the microemulsion allows Neoral's active ingredient—cyclosporine—to be absorbed more quickly and efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract. See FDA Docket No. 96-P-0459, Response to Petition Filed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., at 4 (Nov. 2, 1998) ("Petition Response"). This difference means that the Sandimmune and Neoral products are not bioequivalent (i.e., they are bioinequivalent) and that a physician's decision to switch a patient from one to the other may require a different prescription.


7
To highlight the differences between Sandimmune and Neoral, the FDA initially incorporated the term "microemulsion" into both Neoral's established name and its dosage form. When the FDA approved the Neoral products in 1995, it assigned them the established names "cyclosporine oral solution for microemulsion" and "cyclosporine capsules for microemulsion." Petition Response at 5; see also Joint Appendix 966-67. Shortly thereafter, the FDA created two new dosage forms and assigned them to the Neoral products: "capsule, microemulsion" and "solution, microemulsion."


8
At a symposium in December 1997 a leading transplant physician made a presentation about the development of a generic version of Neoral that formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion. Alarmed, Novartis filed a citizen petition in March 1998 requesting that the FDA not approve any generic with a dosage form that was not identical to Neoral's, or at least that it require an applicant seeking approval of such a drug to first file a suitability petition. (Novartis had previously filed another citizen petition, which the FDA denied in the same response as it denied the March 1998 petition; Novartis hasn't appealed denial of the first petition.) In principle the petition was simply a request that the FDA obey the law, though it could be taken as implicitly urging the FDA not to delete "microemulsion" from the dosage forms assigned to the Neoral products. In fact the FDA did just what Novartis sought to avoid.


9
Responding to the petition in November 1998, the FDA announced that it would eliminate the microemulsion dosage forms altogether. It explained that it had determined that Neoral's ability to form a microemulsion was not a function of dosage form; rather than being an aspect of the "physical recognition, appearance, dosing and manner of administration," the microemulsion-forming feature of Neoral appeared only after the patient swallowed the product (or, in the case of the oral solution, mixed it with another beverage to make it more palatable) and was therefore a characteristic of the product's "formulation." Petition Response at 12-13 & n. 14. There is no requirement that a generic drug have the same formulation as its pioneer. Moreover, the FDA said, elimination of the microemulsion dosage form would serve its policy goal of encouraging the availability of generic products. Id. at 14. Finally, it said that in light of its dosage form ruling it had reexamined the Neoral products' established names and determined that they should no longer refer to microemulsion. The new established names would be simply "cyclosporine capsules" and "cyclosporine oral solution." These names would apply to Sandimmune, to Neoral, and to any approved generic versions of Neoral that formed either microemulsions or microdispersions. To communicate the differences between Sandimmune on the one hand and Neoral and generic equivalents that form either microemulsions or microdispersions on the other, FDA said it would now require the label for Neoral and its generic equivalents to include the term "MODIFIED." Petition Response at 17. This term, explained the FDA, "is appropriate to alert physicians, pharmacists, and patients that Neoral's formulation presents a different bioavailability profile than the Sandimmune formulation," and "is broad enough to encompass different, bioequivalent formulations of cyclosporine (e.g., a microemulsion or microdispersion) and, prominently displayed in bold type, the term may become readily associated with the more bioavailable formulations of cyclosporine." Id.


10
The FDA issued this decision around the time that it approved an ANDA for SangCya, a generic cyclosporine solution manufactured by SangStat Medical Corp. SangStat had submitted data purporting to show that SangCya was bioequivalent to Neoral. SangCya differed from Neoral in precisely the way that Novartis had anticipated a generic competitor might: it formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion. Had the Neoral products' dosage forms, labeling, and established names continued to refer to microemulsion, SangStat would not have been able to secure FDA approval for SangCya by directly filing an ANDA.


11
A few months later, in February 1999, Novartis filed suit in district court raising challenges to the FDA's approval of the SangCya ANDA as well as to the FDA's modifications to Neoral's dosage forms, labeling, and established names. The district court found that the first of these challenges was moot: While this litigation was before the district court, new evidence came to light revealing that SangCya was not bioequivalent to Neoral when properly administered with apple juice instead of with chocolate milk, and the FDA withdrew its approval of SangCya. (FDA reports that as of the time it submitted its reply brief, there were eight approved and not withdrawn generic equivalents for Neoral, half of which form microemulsions. Br. for Appellee 11. Presumably the other half form microdispersions.) We affirm the district court's conclusion that the withdrawal mooted Novartis's challenge to that approval for the reasons given by the district court. Mem. Op. (Mar. 5, 2001) 5-9.


12
On subsequent cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court rejected the challenges to the FDA's disposition of Novartis's citizen petition. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004). We affirm the district court's rejection of each of Novartis's substantive challenges to the FDA's decisions regarding dosage forms, labeling, and established names of its Neoral products. Because we have nothing to add to the district court's reasoning on these issues, we do not address them here. We do address below Novartis's challenges to the completeness of the administrative record and to the procedures employed by the FDA to change Neoral's dosage forms, labeling, and established names. In each case, we affirm the district court.


13
* * * * * *


14
The first objection that Novartis raises on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to require production of the "whole record" as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. We review the district court's refusal to supplement the administrative record for abuse of discretion. See James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C.Cir.1996).


15
There are actually two administrative records at issue in this case. The first is the public docket for Novartis's citizen petition, the second is the record of the FDA's approval of the SangCya ANDA. The district court initially referred the question of the records' proper scope to a magistrate judge, who refused Novartis's requests to supplement the citizen petition record with records from a group of prior proceedings that Novartis claimed were relevant, finding that FDA did not consider these records in addressing the citizen petition. Mem. Op. (Jan. 18, 2000) 5-8. The magistrate judge did provide Novartis with the SangCya ANDA approval record after withholding some trade-secret, confidential-commercial, and otherwise privileged information. Id. at 8-11. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge's determinations. Mem. Op. (May 4, 2000).


16
When the new evidence concerning SangCya's bioinequivalence became available, Novartis again sought to supplement the record. The magistrate judge agreed with Novartis in part, expanding the record to include both the new bioinequivalence data and the hitherto withheld portions of SangCya's ANDA relating to its asserted bioequivalence. Mem. Op. (Nov. 27, 2000). In a subsequent decision the district court addressed both SangStat's motion to dismiss Novartis's challenge to the SangCya approval (by then withdrawn) as moot and SangStat's separate motion to reconsider the magistrate judge's determination regarding the scope of the record. The district court found that Novartis's attack on the SangCya approval was moot, Mem. Op. (Mar. 5, 2001) 5-9; as noted above, we affirm that decision for the reasons stated. The district court then vacated the magistrate judge's expansion of the record, regarding its decision on substantive mootness as controlling that issue. Id. at 9.


17
On appeal, Novartis renews the supplementation requests denied by the district court. In making its case Novartis relies heavily on American Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 243 F.3d 579 (D.C.Cir.2001), and Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788 (D.C.Cir.1984). These cases do little to support Novartis's position. The agency failed to file any administrative record at all in the former case, American Bioscience, Inc., 243 F.3d at 582, while in the latter neither party purported to have provided the court with the complete administrative record, Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital, 749 F.2d at 792. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's holding that the administrative record was complete and sufficient for judicial review; we adopt its reasoning except with respect to Novartis's efforts to include the data that originally purported to establish SangCya's bioequivalence to Neoral. Rather than resting on the mootness of Novartis's challenges to SangCya's approval, we rely on the district court's later finding that Novartis has pointed to nothing to support its claim that the FDA's approval of SangCya tainted its consideration of the logically distinct issues raised by Novartis's own citizen petition. See Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 26-27. Novartis makes one other claim about the record, but because it is closely related to Novartis's procedural challenge to the FDA's modifications of the Neoral products' established names, we address it in the next section.


18
* * * * * *


19
Novartis raises two procedural objections that apply to each of the FDA's decisions regarding Neoral's dosage forms, labeling, and established names, and a third procedural objection that applies only to the FDA's modification of the established names for the two Neoral products. These challenges rely, in varying proportions, on interpretations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and regulations interpreting that statute. We have held on a number of occasions that FDA interpretations of the FDCA receive deference, as do its interpretations of its own regulations unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations. See, e.g., Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. v. Thompson, 354 F.3d 877, 883 (D.C.Cir.2004); Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1071 n. 13 (D.C.Cir.1998).


20
First, Novartis objects to the FDA's failure to publicly docket any of SangStat's requests that the FDA modify the dosage forms, labeling, and established names that apply to Novartis's Neoral products, saying that the FDA violated its own procedures by not treating those requests as citizen petitions. See 21 C.F.R. § 10.30. The district court held that the provision permitting an interested person to petition the FDA "does not require FDA to convert every letter or telephone call it receives in conjunction with an ANDA into a citizen petition." Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 24. And, the district court pointed out, another regulation forbids the FDA from disclosing information about a pending ANDA unless its existence has previously been publicly disclosed. Id. (citing 21 C.F.R. § 314.430(b)-(c)). We affirm.


21
Second, Novartis insists that the FDA erred by failing to provide Novartis with notice or opportunity to comment on its decisions. The district court disagreed, pointing out that Novartis's own citizen petition gave it an opportunity to show, in detail, why it believed that the microemulsion dosage forms were appropriate. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 25. We also note that Novartis acknowledged the link between dosage form and labeling in that same petition and that the public docket indicates Novartis took advantage of its opportunity to respond to comments made by others in response to its petition. As Novartis received ample notice and opportunity to be heard, it has already received every benefit that it could from a favorable judgment on this issue. Better Government Ass'n v. Department of State, 780 F.2d 86, 91 & n. 21 (D.C.Cir.1986).


22
Third, Novartis makes a more specific argument that the FDA's actions in modifying the Neoral products' established names were not procedurally proper. Our analysis of this argument is more complicated because Novartis and the FDA disagree on how to characterize the status of the nonproprietary names assigned to the Neoral products when the FDA approved them in 1995. Novartis argues that the FDA designated "official" names pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 358(a). This is significant, Novartis argues, because it means that the FDA may not modify those names without undertaking notice-and-comment rulemaking. We conclude that Novartis fails to establish either that the FDA was required to proceed under § 358, or that as a discretionary matter it did proceed under that section, in originally establishing nonproprietary names for the Neoral products in 1995.


23
To evaluate Novartis's arguments regarding the FDA's initial assignment of nonproprietary names, we begin by reviewing the statutory and regulatory framework governing established names. There are two key statutory provisions. The first is 21 U.S.C. § 352(e)(1)(A)(i), which provides that a drug may be subject to charges of misbranding unless its label bears, among other things, "the established name (as defined in subparagraph (3)) of the drug, if there is such a name." Subparagraph (3) provides that "established name" means:


24
(A) the applicable official name designated pursuant to section 358 of this title, or


25
(B), if there is no such name and such drug, or such ingredient, is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium, or


26
(C) if neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this subparagraph applies, then the common or usual name, if any, of such drug or of such ingredient [with an exception that is not relevant here].


27
21 U.S.C. § 352(e)(3). Neither party argues that clause (C) applies to the name given Novartis's products in 1995, and they affirmatively agree that clause (B) didn't apply to those designations. See Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 28 n. 12. The "official compendium" referred to in clause (B) is the United States Pharmacopoeia ("USP"); the applicable article (or monograph) titles in the USP omit the term "microemulsion."


28
Reasoning by process of elimination, Novartis argues that with clauses (B) and (C) out of the picture the FDA's 1995 action must have been a designation under clause (A) of § 352(e)(3). Br. for Appellants 34. But this hardly appears to be the only reasonable reading of the statute. For starters, § 352(e)(1)(A)(i) refers to an established name "if there is such a name," suggesting that the categories of established names set out in § 352(e)(3) do not exhaust the categories of nonproprietary names that the FDA might assign.2


29
Novartis tries to buttress its reading by asserting that § 352(e)(3) defines the three name categories in "descending order of preference." Br. for Appellants 34. Novartis seems to have no basis for the claim; every list puts some things lower than others, but order is not necessarily an indication of rank. Also, the FDA's regulations take quite a different position, providing that the FDA "will not routinely designate official names under section 508 of the act [21 U.S.C. § 358]...." 21 C.F.R. § 299.4(e).


30
The second key statutory provision is § 358. Subsection (a) provides:


31
The Secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Any official name designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the only official name of that drug or device used in any official compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any other purpose of this chapter.


32
21 U.S.C. § 358(a). Section 358(b) requires the Secretary to undertake an apparently comprehensive review of the names by which drugs are identified in official compendia—i.e., in the USP. Section 358(c) provides that if, after such a review, the Secretary determines that any names in the USP are problematic in any of several specified ways, the Secretary will initiate a notice-and-comment rulemaking to replace them with new names.


33
Novartis's argument that the FDA in fact designated an official name pursuant to § 358 runs into trouble because the FDA's 1995 actions didn't align with the requirements of § 358. First, there is no indication that the comprehensive review described in § 358(b), at least arguably a prerequisite to a § 358 designation, ever occurred. Second, as the district court pointed out, § 358(c) requires the agency to designate the official names through notice-and-comment rulemaking, which wasn't done in 1995. Novartis argues that the notice-and-comment requirement was satisfied because the FDA designated names for Novartis's Neoral products "at the conclusion of a formal process involving consultation with the USP [Nomenclature Committee] and rejection of the existing USP compendial name," Br. for Appellant 34, but it never explains why those procedures should be considered interchangeable with notice-and-comment rulemaking. Nor did the FDA publicly indicate in some other way in 1995 that it was designating an official name under § 358. Third, § 358(a) requires that once the FDA designates an official name, that name must be used in any official compendium. But, as explained above, the USP Nomenclature Committee did not adopt the nonproprietary names that the FDA assigned to Neoral in 1995. Novartis disregards this statutory requirement. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe such a designation occurred. Cf. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 28-29.


34
Finally, Novartis contends that whether the FDA assigned official names pursuant to § 358 is a factual question that cannot be answered without supplementing the administrative record with documentation of the FDA's actions when it originally approved nonproprietary names for the Neoral products. We see no need for such an excavation. Given the gaps identified above, there is no serious likelihood that extra documentation of the process by which the FDA developed the nonproprietary names it initially assigned to the Neoral would overturn our conclusion that the FDA did not proceed under § 358.


35
Having rejected Novartis's characterization of the FDA's actions in 1995, we examine the agency's explanation of the names it then assigned to the Neoral products as "interim established names." The FDA argues that the reference in § 352(e)(1)(A)(i) to a drug's established name, "if there is such a name," means that it was not limited to the options set out in § 352(e)(3) in designating a nonproprietary name. It explains that it had filled that statutory gap by creating a fourth category of names for drug products: "interim established names." Recall that under § 352(e)(3) a drug product's established name could be the official monograph title for that product in the USP. The USP Nomenclature Committee acts on its own schedule, so that its designation of a name qualifying under § 352(e)(3)(B) need not coincide with the FDA's approval of a drug. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 29-30. Given the variable sequence, the FDA's designation of "interim" or "provisional" established names outside the § 352(e)(3) triad appears both consistent with the statutory structure and reasonable.


36
As the statute leaves space for FDA designation of interim or provisional established names, Novartis has no basis for claiming that § 358 commands a notice-and-comment rulemaking for the change of such a name. And Novartis makes no claim that the APA itself commands use of that specific procedure in the absence of a § 358 designation. Insofar as Novartis makes a general claim that FDA acts arbitrarily and capriciously by not providing adequate notice and opportunity for comment before making any change of the Neoral products' interim names, our earlier observation controls: Novartis had ample notice and opportunity to comment in its own citizen petition proceeding.


37
* * * * * *

The judgment of the district court is

38

Affirmed.




Notes:


1
 The same-label requirement excepts differences required because the generic was approved under a suitability petition or "because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers." 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(v); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(8)(iv)


2
 The parties appear to assume that § 352(e)(1)(A)(i)'s labeling requirements encompass any nonproprietary name assigned to a drug by the FDA even if the name does not qualify under § 352(e)(3). We express no opinion on the issue

Michael O. Leavitt

From MormonWiki

Jump to: navigation, search

 
Michael O. Leavitt is an American politician and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sometimes casually called the Mormon Church.  He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2005 to 2009, and as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 2003 to 2005. He was the 14th Governor of Utah from 1993 to 2003.
Mike Leavitt was born on February 11, 1951, in Cedar City, Utah, to Dixie Lorraine and Phyllis Anne Okerlund Leavitt.  He graduated from Southern Utah University with a bachelor's degree in economics and business. He is married to Jacalyn Smith and they have five children, four sons and one daughter.
Leavitt is descended both from American colonial and Mormon pioneer stock.  His ancestor Thomas Dudley was the second colonial governor of Massachusetts.  Dudley's descendant, Dudley Leavitt was a Mormon pioneer.  
The Leavitt Group, a regional insurance company founded by Mike Leavitt's father, provided Leavitt with his first professional career engagement.  Mike Leavitt expanded the company, as he became its president and CEO.  As he served in these positions, Leavitt also served on the boards of directors for other companies.  He was also a member of the Utah State Board of Regents, overseeing Utah's nine public colleges and universities.   For four years, he was chair of Southern Utah University's board of trustees. [1]
n 1976, Leavitt assisted his father, then a state senator, in an unsuccessful campaign for governor. He worked on a number of U.S. Senate campaigns through the 1980s for Jake Garn and Orrin Hatch.  Leavitt first ran for governor of Utah in 1992.  Though he had to come from behind in the Republican primary, he defeated the Democratic candidate, Stewart Hanson, and became the 14th governor of Utah, an office he held for three terms.  Leavitt has been Utah's only three-term governor.  During his eleven years as Governor, Utah was recognized six times as one of America’s best managed states.  Leavitt was chosen by his peers as Chairman of the National Governors Association, Western Governors Association, and Republican Governors Association.
In 1997, while serving as Utah governor, Leavitt helped to found an online university, Western Governors University. Nineteen governors signed legislation creating the school as a non-profit private university.
On August 11, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Leavitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Leavitt was confirmed on October 28, 2003, by a vote of 88–8 in the United States Senate, and sworn in on November 5, 2003.  On December 13, 2004, Leavitt was nominated by Bush to succeed Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services, and was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 26, 2005.  During his tenure with Health and Human Services, Leavitt warned congress that Medicare was headed for disaster.  Leavitt claimed that congress didn't take the warning seriously enough. The department is one of the largest civilian departments in the federal government with more than 67,000 employees and a budget that accounts for almost one out of every four federal dollars. [2]
Because of the perceived threat of the avian flu, Leavitt mobilized the nation’s pandemic preparedness and reconfigured the nation’s medical emergency plans. He also implemented the Medicare prescription drug benefit, worked toward transparency of price and quality in health, and developed a new national strategy for safety of imported products. Leavitt also served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council.
Leavitt has created The Leavitt Partners to consult firms in the private sector and help them understand the federal regulatory bureaucracy regarding health and food safety.
In the year 2000, Leavitt and his family formalized their philanthropic efforts by creating the Dixie and Anne Leavitt Foundation.  The Leavitt's have donated over $9 million to the foundation.  The foundation's principal beneficiaries have been Southern Utah University and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other beneficiaries have included arts, educational and humanitarian organizations, including the Leavitt family genealogical society.  Mike Leavitt has not been directly involved in the foundation's operations.

Mike Leavitt is the founder of Leavitt Partners where he helps clients navigate the future as they transition to new and better models of care. In previous roles, Mike served in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush (as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Secretary of Health and Human Services) and as a three-time elected governor of Utah.

Read More


Mike grew up in Cedar City, Utah, where his upbringing was rooted in the values of the American West, with its emphasis on hard work and common sense. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business while working in the insurance industry. In 1984, he became chief executive of The Leavitt Group, a family business that is now the nation’s second largest, privately held insurance brokerage.
In 1993, Mike was elected governor of Utah. He served three terms (1993-2003). In 2003, he joined the Cabinet of President George W. Bush, serving in two positions: first as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (2003-2005) and then as secretary of Health and Human Services (2005-2009). At HHS, he administered a $750 billion budget — nearly 25 percent of the entire federal budget — and 67,000 employees.
He led the implementation of the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The task required the design, systematization, and implementation of a plan to provide 43 million seniors with a new prescription drug benefit. By the end of the first year, enrollments exceeded projections, prices were lower than projected, and seniors expressed high levels of satisfaction.
Mike’s strategic ability can be seen in his redesign of the nation’s system of quality and safety standards for imported goods. In the spring of 2006, President Bush assigned him to lead a government-wide response. Within months, he commended a major strategic shift in U.S. policy on import regulation and trade.
A pattern of innovation runs throughout Mike’s career. When he was elected governor, Utah’s major freeway system was dangerously inadequate. Taking what some thought was a significant political and financial risk, Mike instigated a design-build system, creating cost and quality incentives between the state and its contractors. The project was finished in half the originally projected time and well under budget.
Mike is, at heart, an entrepreneur. As governor, he organized a group of his colleagues to form Western Governors University. At WGU, degrees are earned based on competency rather than credit hours. WGU now has more than 60,000 students who reside in each of the 50 states and several foreign countries. Enrollment is growing at 35 percent a year. In November 2008, TIME magazine named WGU “the best relatively cheap university you’ve never heard of.”
Collaborator is a word that comes up repeatedly when one examines Mike’s background. His skill led his colleague governors to elect him as chairman of the National Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association and Western Governors’ Association. His book—Finding Allies, Building Alliances—was released in September 2013 by Jossey-Bass Publishers and chronicles his expertise and passion for collaboration.
Mike is a seasoned diplomat, leading U.S. delegations to more than 50 countries. He has conducted negotiations on matters related to health, the environment, and trade. At the conclusion of his service, the Chinese government awarded him the China Public Health Award – the first time this award has ever been given to a foreign government official.

At HHS, he directed and coordinated the activities of the largest department in the federal government, serving as the Secretary’s day-to-day manager for a department that employed 67,000 people and had an annual budget in excess of $840 billion. He also led the negotiations between China and the FDA regarding Drug, Device and Food issues which led to landmark agreements in 2008 and paved the way for the placement of US-FDA offices around the world. From November 2003 until January 2005, Rich served as senior counselor and chief of staff to Administrator Leavitt at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Rich co-authored with Mike Leavitt the highly-acclaimed book titled Finding Allies, Building Alliances.
Prior to his public service in Washington, D.C., Rich served as chief of staff to Governor Mike Leavitt and as commissioner of the Utah State Tax Commission. His background is as a private practice lawyer and educator. Rich received his juris doctorate from the University of Utah and bachelor’s degree from Ohio University.

					United States Court of Appeals FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT _________  Argued October 24, 2005  Decided January 27, 2006  No. 04-5414 NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION, APPELLANT v. MICHAEL O. LEAVITT, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND LESTER M. CRAWFORD, JR., ACTING COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS, APPELLEES ________ Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (No. 99cv00323) _________ John M. Engel III argued the cause and filed the briefs for appellant. Drake Cutini, Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Eugene M. Thirolf, Jr., Director, Alex M. Azar II, General Counsel, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Eric M.   2 Blumberg, Deputy Chief Counsel, and Karen E. Schifter, Associate Chief Counsel. Before: TATEL and GRIFFITH, Circuit Judges, and WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge. Opinion for the Court filed by Senior Circuit Judge WILLIAMS. Securing FDA WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge: approval for a generic drug is generally a much simpler and faster process than securing approval for a     pioneer     drug. Instead of directly demonstrating the drug    s safety and efficacy, see 21 U.S.C. § 355(a), manufacturers of the generic file an abbreviated new drug application (    ANDA    ) that need show only that the generic is the same as the pioneer drug along certain dimensions. See § 355(j)(2)(A)(i)-(viii). This case concerns FDA    s decision to change the dosage forms, labeling, and established names associated with appellant Novartis    s pioneer drug in ways that would ease the path for competing generic drugs. Novartis raises a number of procedural and substantive challenges to FDA    s changes. The district court rejected all and we affirm. * * * The fastest route to FDA approval requires an ANDA to demonstrate not only that a generic drug has the same active ingredient(s) as the pioneer drug and is bioequivalent to it, i.e., roughly speaking, is absorbed at the same rate and to the same extent when administered under similar conditions, but also that the generic and pioneer drugs have the same dosage form and labeling. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(ii)-(v). The latter two requirements are at issue in this case.   3     Dosage forms     are categories that relate to such matters as a drug    s appearance, physical form, and method of administration. The FDA assigns each drug a dosage form; currently there are 77 such categories. See FDA, APPROVED DRUG PRODUCTS WITH THERAPEUTIC EQUIVALENCE EVALUATIONS Appx. C (25th ed. 2005). Some of the dosage forms are quite broad (for example,     elixir     or     tablet, chewable    ), while others are relatively narrow (for example,     injectable, lipid complex    ). Id. If a generic manufacturer cannot show that its drug has the same dosage form as the pioneer drug, it can still obtain FDA approval, but the process is more arduous: the manufacturer may use an abbreviated application only if it first files a     suitability petition     and the FDA grants it permission to file an ANDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(C); 21 C.F.R. § 314.93. Even if the drug is ultimately approved, the difference in dosage form will preclude the generic from being designated therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer drug, and will thus disqualify the generic from being considered automatically substitutable for the pioneer drug under various state pharmacy laws. See Warner-Lambert v. Shalala, 202 F.3d 326, 327-28 (D.C. Cir. 2000). To avoid charges of misbranding, the labels of prescription drugs must include certain pieces of information displayed in a particular way. See 21 U.S.C. § 352. Thus the requirement that a generic have the same labeling as the pioneer drug incorporates several additional requirements, two of which are relevant to this case.1 First, FDA requires the  1  The same-label requirement excepts differences required because the generic was approved under a suitability petition or     because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or   4 labels to contain the pioneer drug    s dosage form, see 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(a)(1)(ii), so the same-label requirement reincorporates the requirement that the generic drug share the pioneer drug    s dosage form. Second, the FDA requires prescription drug labels to include the drug    s established name, see 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(a)(1)(i), which is a nonproprietary name assigned to the drug by the FDA. The rule mandating inclusion of the established nonproprietary name on the label means that a generic drug must have the same nonproprietary name as the pioneer drug for the FDA to approve the generic drug through the ANDA process. We turn later to the statutory framework for assigning such names. Novartis markets cyclosporine drug products that are widely prescribed to prevent organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart transplants. (These drugs were developed by Novartis    s predecessor, Sandoz Corp. For simplicity, we refer to both corporations as Novartis.) It markets two types of cyclosporine drugs under the proprietary names Sandimmune and Neoral. Both are available as capsules and as solutions, and both form emulsions when they come into contact with aqueous liquids. The difference is the size of the droplets in which the active ingredient is dispersed. Sandimmune forms a macroemulsion and disperses cyclosporine in larger droplets than does Neoral, which forms a microemulsion. The smaller size of the droplets in the microemulsion allows Neoral    s active ingredient    cyclosporine    to be absorbed more quickly and efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract. See FDA  distributed by different manufacturers.     § 355(j)(2)(A)(v); 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(8)(iv).  21  U.S.C.   5 Docket No. 96-P-0459, Response to Petition Filed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., at 4 (Nov. 2, 1998) (    Petition Response    ). This difference means that the Sandimmune and Neoral products are not bioequivalent (i.e., they are bioinequivalent) and that a physician    s decision to switch a patient from one to the other may require a different prescription. To highlight the differences between Sandimmune and Neoral, the FDA initially incorporated the term     microemulsion     into both Neoral    s established name and its dosage form. When the FDA approved the Neoral products in 1995, it assigned them the established names     cyclosporine oral solution for microemulsion     and     cyclosporine capsules for microemulsion.     Petition Response at 5; see also Joint Appendix 966-67. Shortly thereafter, the FDA created two new dosage forms and assigned them to the Neoral products:     capsule, microemulsion     and     solution, microemulsion.     At a symposium in December 1997 a leading transplant physician made a presentation about the development of a generic version of Neoral that formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion. Alarmed, Novartis filed a citizen petition in March 1998 requesting that the FDA not approve any generic with a dosage form that was not identical to Neoral    s, or at least that it require an applicant seeking approval of such a drug to first file a suitability petition. (Novartis had previously filed another citizen petition, which the FDA denied in the same response as it denied the March 1998 petition; Novartis hasn    t appealed denial of the first petition.) In principle the petition was simply a request that the FDA obey the law, though it could be taken as implicitly urging the FDA not to delete     microemulsion     from the dosage forms assigned to the   6 Neoral products. sought to avoid.  In fact the FDA did just what Novartis  Responding to the petition in November 1998, the FDA announced that it would eliminate the microemulsion dosage forms altogether. It explained that it had determined that Neoral    s ability to form a microemulsion was not a function of dosage form; rather than being an aspect of the     physical recognition, appearance, dosing and manner of administration,     the microemulsion-forming feature of Neoral appeared only after the patient swallowed the product (or, in the case of the oral solution, mixed it with another beverage to make it more palatable) and was therefore a characteristic of the product    s     formulation.     Petition Response at 12-13 & n.14. There is no requirement that a generic drug have the same formulation as its pioneer. Moreover, the FDA said, elimination of the microemulsion dosage form would serve its policy goal of encouraging the availability of generic products. Id. at 14. Finally, it said that in light of its dosage form ruling it had reexamined the Neoral products     established names and determined that they should no longer refer to microemulsion. The new established names would be simply     cyclosporine capsules     and     cyclosporine oral solution.     These names would apply to Sandimmune, to Neoral, and to any approved generic versions of Neoral that formed either microemulsions or microdispersions. To communicate the differences between Sandimmune on the one hand and Neoral and generic equivalents that form either microemulsions or microdispersions on the other, FDA said it would now require the label for Neoral and its generic equivalents to include the term     MODIFIED.     Petition Response at 17. This term, explained the FDA,     is appropriate to alert physicians, pharmacists, and patients that Neoral    s formulation presents a different bioavailability   7 profile than the Sandimmune formulation,     and     is broad enough to encompass different, bioequivalent formulations of cyclosporine (e.g., a microemulsion or microdispersion) and, prominently displayed in bold type, the term may become readily associated with the more bioavailable formulations of cyclosporine.     Id. The FDA issued this decision around the time that it approved an ANDA for SangCya, a generic cyclosporine solution manufactured by SangStat Medical Corp. SangStat had submitted data purporting to show that SangCya was bioequivalent to Neoral. SangCya differed from Neoral in precisely the way that Novartis had anticipated a generic competitor might: it formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion. Had the Neoral products     dosage forms, labeling, and established names continued to refer to microemulsion, SangStat would not have been able to secure FDA approval for SangCya by directly filing an ANDA. A few months later, in February 1999, Novartis filed suit in district court raising challenges to the FDA    s approval of the SangCya ANDA as well as to the FDA    s modifications to Neoral    s dosage forms, labeling, and established names. The district court found that the first of these challenges was moot: While this litigation was before the district court, new evidence came to light revealing that SangCya was not bioequivalent to Neoral when properly administered with apple juice instead of with chocolate milk, and the FDA withdrew its approval of SangCya. (FDA reports that as of the time it submitted its reply brief, there were eight approved and not withdrawn generic equivalents for Neoral, half of which form microemulsions. Br. for Appellee 11. Presumably the other half form microdispersions.) We affirm   8 the district court    s conclusion that the withdrawal mooted Novartis    s challenge to that approval for the reasons given by the district court. Mem. Op. (Mar. 5, 2001) 5-9. On subsequent cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court rejected the challenges to the FDA    s disposition of Novartis    s citizen petition. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004). We affirm the district court    s rejection of each of Novartis    s substantive challenges to the FDA    s decisions regarding dosage forms, labeling, and established names of its Neoral products. Because we have nothing to add to the district court    s reasoning on these issues, we do not address them here. We do address below Novartis    s challenges to the completeness of the administrative record and to the procedures employed by the FDA to change Neoral    s dosage forms, labeling, and established names. In each case, we affirm the district court. * * * The first objection that Novartis raises on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to require production of the     whole record     as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. We review the district court    s refusal to supplement the administrative record for abuse of discretion. See James Madison Ltd. v. Ludwig, 82 F.3d 1085, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1996). There are actually two administrative records at issue in this case. The first is the public docket for Novartis    s citizen petition, the second is the record of the FDA    s approval of the SangCya ANDA. The district court initially referred the question of the records     proper scope to a magistrate judge, who refused Novartis    s requests to supplement the citizen petition record with records from a group of prior proceedings   9 that Novartis claimed were relevant, finding that FDA did not consider these records in addressing the citizen petition. Mem. Op. (Jan. 18, 2000) 5-8. The magistrate judge did provide Novartis with the SangCya ANDA approval record after withholding some trade-secret, confidential-commercial, and otherwise privileged information. Id. at 8-11. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge    s determinations. Mem. Op. (May 4, 2000). When the new evidence concerning SangCya    s bioinequivalence became available, Novartis again sought to supplement the record. The magistrate judge agreed with Novartis in part, expanding the record to include both the new bioinequivalence data and the hitherto withheld portions of SangCya    s ANDA relating to its asserted bioequivalence. Mem. Op. (Nov. 27, 2000). In a subsequent decision the district court addressed both SangStat    s motion to dismiss Novartis    s challenge to the SangCya approval (by then withdrawn) as moot and SangStat    s separate motion to reconsider the magistrate judge    s determination regarding the scope of the record. The district court found that Novartis    s attack on the SangCya approval was moot, Mem. Op. (Mar. 5, 2001) 5-9; as noted above, we affirm that decision for the reasons stated. The district court then vacated the magistrate judge    s expansion of the record, regarding its decision on substantive mootness as controlling that issue. Id. at 9. On appeal, Novartis renews the supplementation requests denied by the district court. In making its case Novartis relies heavily on American Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson, 243 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 2001), and Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hosp. v. Heckler, 749 F.2d 788 (D.C. Cir. 1984). These cases do little to support Novartis    s position. The agency failed to file any administrative record at all in the former case, American   10 Bioscience, Inc., 243 F.3d at 582, while in the latter neither party purported to have provided the court with the complete administrative record, Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital, 749 F.2d at 792. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court    s holding that the administrative record was complete and sufficient for judicial review; we adopt its reasoning except with respect to Novartis    s efforts to include the data that originally purported to establish SangCya    s bioequivalence to Neoral. Rather than resting on the mootness of Novartis    s challenges to SangCya    s approval, we rely on the district court    s later finding that Novartis has pointed to nothing to support its claim that the FDA    s approval of SangCya tainted its consideration of the logically distinct issues raised by Novartis    s own citizen petition. See Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 26-27. Novartis makes one other claim about the record, but because it is closely related to Novartis    s procedural challenge to the FDA    s modifications of the Neoral products     established names, we address it in the next section. * * * Novartis raises two procedural objections that apply to each of the FDA    s decisions regarding Neoral    s dosage forms, labeling, and established names, and a third procedural objection that applies only to the FDA    s modification of the established names for the two Neoral products. These challenges rely, in varying proportions, on interpretations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (    FDCA    ) and regulations interpreting that statute. We have held on a number of occasions that FDA interpretations of the FDCA receive deference, as do its interpretations of its own regulations unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the   11 regulations. See, e.g., Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. v. Thompson, 354 F.3d 877, 883 (D.C. Cir. 2004); Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1071 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1998). First, Novartis objects to the FDA    s failure to publicly docket any of SangStat    s requests that the FDA modify the dosage forms, labeling, and established names that apply to Novartis    s Neoral products, saying that the FDA violated its own procedures by not treating those requests as citizen petitions. See 21 C.F.R. § 10.30. The district court held that the provision permitting an interested person to petition the FDA     does not require FDA to convert every letter or telephone call it receives in conjunction with an ANDA into a citizen petition.     Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 24. And, the district court pointed out, another regulation forbids the FDA from disclosing information about a pending ANDA unless its existence has previously been publicly disclosed. Id. (citing 21 C.F.R. § 314.430(b)-(c)). We affirm. Second, Novartis insists that the FDA erred by failing to provide Novartis with notice or opportunity to comment on its decisions. The district court disagreed, pointing out that Novartis    s own citizen petition gave it an opportunity to show, in detail, why it believed that the microemulsion dosage forms were appropriate. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 25. We also note that Novartis acknowledged the link between dosage form and labeling in that same petition and that the public docket indicates Novartis took advantage of its opportunity to respond to comments made by others in response to its petition. As Novartis received ample notice and opportunity to be heard, it has already received every benefit that it could from a favorable judgment on this issue. Better Government   12 Ass    n v. Department of State, 780 F.2d 86, 91 & n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Third, Novartis makes a more specific argument that the FDA    s actions in modifying the Neoral products     established names were not procedurally proper. Our analysis of this argument is more complicated because Novartis and the FDA disagree on how to characterize the status of the nonproprietary names assigned to the Neoral products when the FDA approved them in 1995. Novartis argues that the FDA designated     official     names pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 358(a). This is significant, Novartis argues, because it means that the FDA may not modify those names without undertaking notice-and-comment rulemaking. We conclude that Novartis fails to establish either that the FDA was required to proceed under § 358, or that as a discretionary matter it did proceed under that section, in originally establishing nonproprietary names for the Neoral products in 1995. To evaluate Novartis    s arguments regarding the FDA    s initial assignment of nonproprietary names, we begin by reviewing the statutory and regulatory framework governing established names. There are two key statutory provisions. The first is 21 U.S.C. § 352(e)(1)(A)(i), which provides that a drug may be subject to charges of misbranding unless its label bears, among other things,     the established name (as defined in subparagraph (3)) of the drug, if there is such a name.     Subparagraph (3) provides that     established name     means: (A) the applicable official name designated pursuant to section 358 of this title, or   13 (B), if there is no such name and such drug, or such ingredient, is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium, or (C) if neither clause (A) nor clause (B) of this subparagraph applies, then the common or usual name, if any, of such drug or of such ingredient [with an exception that is not relevant here]. 21 U.S.C. § 352(e)(3). Neither party argues that clause (C) applies to the name given Novartis    s products in 1995, and they affirmatively agree that clause (B) didn    t apply to those designations. See Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 28 n.12. The     official compendium     referred to in clause (B) is the United States Pharmacopoeia (    USP    ); the applicable article (or monograph) titles in the USP omit the term     microemulsion.     Reasoning by process of elimination, Novartis argues that with clauses (B) and (C) out of the picture the FDA    s 1995 action must have been a designation under clause (A) of § 352(e)(3). Br. for Appellants 34. But this hardly appears to be the only reasonable reading of the statute. For starters, § 352(e)(1)(A)(i) refers to an established name     if there is such a name,     suggesting that the categories of established names set out in § 352(e)(3) do not exhaust the categories of nonproprietary names that the FDA might assign.2  2  The parties appear to assume that § 352(e)(1)(A)(i)    s labeling requirements encompass any nonproprietary name assigned to a drug by the FDA even if the name does not qualify under § 352(e)(3). We express no opinion on the issue.   14 Novartis tries to buttress its reading by asserting that § 352(e)(3) defines the three name categories in     descending order of preference.     Br. for Appellants 34. Novartis seems to have no basis for the claim; every list puts some things lower than others, but order is not necessarily an indication of rank. Also, the FDA    s regulations take quite a different position, providing that the FDA     will not routinely designate official names under section 508 of the act [21 U.S.C. § 358]. . . .     21 C.F.R. § 299.4(e). The second key statutory provision is § 358. Subsection (a) provides: The Secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Any official name designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the only official name of that drug or device used in any official compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any other purpose of this chapter. 21 U.S.C. § 358(a). Section 358(b) requires the Secretary to undertake an apparently comprehensive review of the names by which drugs are identified in official compendia    i.e., in the USP. Section 358(c) provides that if, after such a review, the Secretary determines that any names in the USP are problematic in any of several specified ways, the Secretary will initiate a notice-and-comment rulemaking to replace them with new names. Novartis    s argument that the FDA in fact designated an official name pursuant to § 358 runs into trouble because the FDA    s 1995 actions didn    t align with the requirements of   15 § 358. First, there is no indication that the comprehensive review described in § 358(b), at least arguably a prerequisite to a § 358 designation, ever occurred. Second, as the district court pointed out, § 358(c) requires the agency to designate the official names through notice-and-comment rulemaking, which wasn    t done in 1995. Novartis argues that the noticeand-comment requirement was satisfied because the FDA designated names for Novartis    s Neoral products     at the conclusion of a formal process involving consultation with the USP [Nomenclature Committee] and rejection of the existing USP compendial name,     Br. for Appellant 34, but it never explains why those procedures should be considered interchangeable with notice-and-comment rulemaking. Nor did the FDA publicly indicate in some other way in 1995 that it was designating an official name under § 358. Third, § 358(a) requires that once the FDA designates an official name, that name must be used in any official compendium. But, as explained above, the USP Nomenclature Committee did not adopt the nonproprietary names that the FDA assigned to Neoral in 1995. Novartis disregards this statutory requirement. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe such a designation occurred. Cf. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 28-29. Finally, Novartis contends that whether the FDA assigned official names pursuant to § 358 is a factual question that cannot be answered without supplementing the administrative record with documentation of the FDA    s actions when it originally approved nonproprietary names for the Neoral products. We see no need for such an excavation. Given the gaps identified above, there is no serious likelihood that extra documentation of the process by which the FDA developed the nonproprietary names it initially assigned to the Neoral would overturn our conclusion that the FDA did not proceed under § 358.   16 Having rejected Novartis    s characterization of the FDA    s actions in 1995, we examine the agency    s explanation of the names it then assigned to the Neoral products as     interim established names.     The FDA argues that the reference in § 352(e)(1)(A)(i) to a drug    s established name,     if there is such a name,     means that it was not limited to the options set out in § 352(e)(3) in designating a nonproprietary name. It explains that it had filled that statutory gap by creating a fourth category of names for drug products:     interim established names.     Recall that under § 352(e)(3) a drug product    s established name could be the official monograph title for that product in the USP. The USP Nomenclature Committee acts on its own schedule, so that its designation of a name qualifying under § 352(e)(3)(B) need not coincide with the FDA    s approval of a drug. Mem. Op. (Sept. 9, 2004) 29-30. Given the variable sequence, the FDA    s designation of     interim     or     provisional     established names outside the § 352(e)(3) triad appears both consistent with the statutory structure and reasonable. As the statute leaves space for FDA designation of interim or provisional established names, Novartis has no basis for claiming that § 358 commands a notice-andcomment rulemaking for the change of such a name. And Novartis makes no claim that the APA itself commands use of that specific procedure in the absence of a § 358 designation. Insofar as Novartis makes a general claim that FDA acts arbitrarily and capriciously by not providing adequate notice and opportunity for comment before making any change of the Neoral products     interim names, our earlier observation controls: Novartis had ample notice and opportunity to comment in its own citizen petition proceeding.   17 * * * The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.

D.C. Circuit US Court of Appeals Case Law


The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit encompasses the smallest geographic area of any of the federal circuits with appellate jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. Despite its size, the court has been a major influence on US law and frequently hears litigation involving US federal agencies.More information regarding the history of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit can be found at The Historical Society of the District of Columbia Circuit.

Michael O. Leavitt
Founder and Chairman






Michael O. Leavitt
Founder and Chairman

Former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
3-term Governor of Utah
Co-Chair of the Financial Review Panel for The Global Fund




Michael O. Leavitt is the founder and Chairman of Leavitt Partners where he helps clients navigate the future as they transition to new and better models of care. In previous roles, Leavitt served in the Cabinet of President George W. Bush (Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Secretary of Health and Human Services) and as a three-time elected governor of Utah.
Mike Leavitt grew up in Cedar City, Utah, where his upbringing was rooted in the values of the American West, with its emphasis on hard work and common sense. He earned a bachelor’s degree in business while working in the insurance industry. In 1984, he became chief executive of The Leavitt Group, a family business that is now the nation’s second largest, privately-held insurance brokerage.
In 1993, Leavitt was elected governor of Utah. He served three terms (1993-2003). In 2003, he joined the Cabinet of President George W. Bush, serving in two positions: first as leader of the Environmental Protection Agency (2003-2005) and then as secretary of Health and Human Services (2005-2009). At HHS, Leavitt administered a $750 billion budget — nearly 25 percent of the entire federal budget — and 67,000 employees.
He led the implementation of the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. The task required the design, systematization and implementation of a plan to provide 43 million seniors with a new prescription drug benefit. By the end of the first year, enrollments exceeded projections, prices were lower than projected and seniors expressed high levels of satisfaction.
Leavitt’s strategic ability can be seen in his redesign of the nation’s system of quality and safety standards for imported goods. In the spring of 2006, President Bush assigned him to lead a government-wide response. Within months, Leavitt recommended a major strategic shift in U.S. policy on import regulation and trade.
A pattern of innovation runs throughout Leavitt’s career. When he was elected governor, Utah’s major freeway system was dangerously inadequate. Taking what some thought was a significant political and financial risk, Leavitt instigated a design-build system, creating cost and quality incentives between the state and its contractors. The project was finished in half the originally projected time and well-under budget.
Leavitt is, at heart, an entrepreneur. As governor, he organized a group of his colleagues to form Western Governors University. At WGU, degrees are earned based on competency rather than credit hours. WGU now has more than 20,000 students who reside in each of the 50 states and several foreign countries. Enrollment is growing at 35 percent a year. In November 2008, TIME magazine named WGU “the best relatively cheap university you’ve never heard of.”
Collaborator is a word that comes up repeatedly when one examines Leavitt’s background. His skill led his colleague governors to elect him as chairman of the National Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association and Western Governors’ Association.  His new book—Finding Allies, Building Alliances—was released in September 2013 by Jossey-Bass Publishers and chronicles his expertise and passion for collaboration.
Leavitt is a seasoned diplomat, leading U.S. delegations to more than 50 countries. He has conducted negotiations on matters related to health, the environment and trade. At the conclusion of his service, the Chinese government awarded him the China Public Health Award – the first time this award has ever been given to a foreign government official.
He and his wife Jackie have been married nearly 37 years. They have five children and eleven grandchildren. The Leavitts live in Salt Lake City, Utah.

He is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where he focuses on many issues across the federal government, such as fixing our broken tax code, holding the IRS accountable, strengthening Medicare and Social Security, repairing the safety net, promoting job-creating trade agreements, and developing patient-centered solutions to make health care more affordable.
During the 112th & 113th Congresses, he served as chairman of the House Budget Committee, where he put forward specific plans to tackle our looming fiscal crisis, driven by the dramatic rise in entitlement spending. These plans, titled “The Path to Prosperity,” would help spur job creation, stop spending money the government doesn’t have, and lift the crushing burden of debt, putting the federal budget on the path to balance.
Paul is a graduate of Joseph A. Craig High School in Janesville and earned a degree in economics and political science from Miami University in Ohio.

Kate Hansen
Olympic Luger






Kate Hansen
Olympic Luger




When 21 year old Olympian Kate Hansen isn’t racing 80 miles per hour down a luge track, you can find her surfing on California’s coasts, skiing in Utah resorts, skateboarding, playing the ukulele or throwin’ down dance moves to Beyonce. Hansen grew up in the southern California city of La Canada Flintridge. She attended La Canada High School and was a member of National Charity League for six years. Kate is currently a junior at Brigham Young University.
Kate first got her start in the sport of luge by laying down on her skateboard and flying down her neighborhood streets. She officially joined the sport at the age of ten. Five years later she won the luge world championship in Lake Placid, New York. In October 2013, she found herself on the podium again as the U.S. National Champion. In January of this year in Latvia, Kate became the first American in 17 years to win a world cup event. She followed up her big win with a stop at the Sochi, Russia Olympics where she competed and placed tenth. Kate partially attributes her top ten finish to her warm-up dance routine to Beyonce songs and the lucky penny she stuck in her suit. It was sent to her from a young fan before the games.

The New Way to Find People
More than a regular search engine.

It's the quick and easy way to look people up. Do a deep public record

never have to search someone on google again.
