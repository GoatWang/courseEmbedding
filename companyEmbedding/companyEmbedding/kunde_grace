Winemaker Comments

Technical Information

Shipping Information




“This wine is a fine example of what we believe John Drummond would have envisioned for his special Cabernet Sauvignon vines with lineage to this estate from the 1800’s. While this wine is traditionally a single vineyard selection, a touch of Cabernet Franc gives an added dimension to the wine that we just had to play with. While the Franc may have only visited the selection for one season, we’re sure glad it made it in there. This is a beautiful wine to lay down in the cellar for several years.”

		Harvest Notes:
	

		Low yields and a long growing season led to well-developed flavors and balanced tannins. The Cabernet Sauvignon fruit was fermented using native yeasts. Pumpovers were conducted twice daily and the juice remained on the skins for an additional 30 days. The wine was aged for 20 months in French oak cooperage, 60% new, and bottled in August 2014.

2011 Kunde Cabernet Sauvignon, Drummond Vineyard, Sonoma Valley, Destination Series 750ml
 The Kunde vineyards offer up an impressive bouquet of dark cherries, tea leaves and lavender in this full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon.
Rich and powerful yet blessed with a finesse and grace that carries the currant and cherry flavors across a rich chocolate base. The wine’s supple texture lingers effortlessly against polished tannins.

Winemaker Comments

Technical Information

Shipping Information




	"This wine is a fine example of what we believe John Drummond would have envisioned for his special Cabernet Sauvignon vines with lineage to this Estate from the 1800's. Opulent and complex, it offers up aromatics of tea leaves, lavender and black cherries. The sensory experience is completed with a flavor profile rich in currants, cherries and wintergreen. Enjoy this wine now, but for those of you who can wait, experience it over the next decade."

		Winemaker Notes:
	

		Low yields and a long growing season led to well-developed flavors and balanced tannins. The fermenting Cabernet Sauvignon fruit received pumpovers through sump and screen two times per day during primary fermentation and was left to soak on the skins for a one week maceration. The wine was aged for 20 months in French oak, 50% new, and bottled in August 2013.

(more...)The circumstances in which a debtor may discharge a student loan in bankruptcy. For example, a debtor who has no income and little chance of earning enough in the future to pay off the loan may be able to show that repayment would be an undue hardship.

(more...)A federal law that guarantees a worker's right to be paid fairly. The FLSA defines the 40-hour workweek, sets out the federal minimum wage, states requirements for overtime and places restrictions on child labor.

(more...)A business structure that allows one or more partners (called limited partners) to enjoy limited personal liability for partnership debts while another partner or partners (called general partners) have unlimited personal liability. The key difference between a general and limited partner concerns management decision making--general partners run the business, and limited partners, who are usually passive investors, are not allowed to make day-to-day business decisions. If they do, they risk being treated as general partners with unlimited personal liability.

PREFERENCEA payment made by a debtor to a creditor within a defined period prior to filing for bankruptcy -- within three months for arms-length creditors (regular commer... (more...)A payment made by a debtor to a creditor within a defined period prior to filing for bankruptcy -- within three months for arms-length creditors (regular commercial creditors) and within one year for insider creditors (friends, family members, and business associates). Because a preference gives the creditor who received the payment an edge over other creditors in the bankruptcy case, the trustee can recover the preference (the amount of the payment) and distribute it among all of the creditors.

LIENThe right of a secured creditor to grab a specific item of property if you don't pay a debt. Liens you agree to are called security interests, and include mortg... (more...)The right of a secured creditor to grab a specific item of property if you don't pay a debt. Liens you agree to are called security interests, and include mortgages, home equity loans, car loans and personal loans for which you pledge property to guarantee repayment. Liens created without your consent are called nonconsensual liens, and include judgment liens (liens filed by a creditor who has sued you and obtained a judgment), tax liens and mechanics liens (liens filed by a contractor who worked on your house but wasn't paid).

NO-FAULT INSURANCECar insurance laws that require the insurance companies of each person in an accident to pay for medical bills and lost wages of their insured, up to a certain ... (more...)Car insurance laws that require the insurance companies of each person in an accident to pay for medical bills and lost wages of their insured, up to a certain amount, regardless of who was at fault. The effect of no-fault insurance laws is to eliminate lawsuits in small accidents. The advantage is the prompt payment of medical bills and expenses. The downsides are that the amounts paid by no-fault policies are often not enough to fully cover a person's losses and that no-fault does not compensate for pain and suffering.

GENERAL PARTNERA person who joins with at least one other to own and operate a business for profit -- and who (unlike a corporation's owners), is personally liable for all the... (more...)A person who joins with at least one other to own and operate a business for profit -- and who (unlike a corporation's owners), is personally liable for all the business's debts and obligations. A general partner's actions can legally bind the entire business. See also partnership, limited partnership.

(more...)Common business slang to distinguish a corporation whose profits are taxed separate from its owners under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code, from an S corporation, whose profits are passed through to shareholders and taxed on their personal returns under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.
