Performance data quoted represent past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the Fund may be higher or lower than the performance quoted.
Rates of return for periods greater than one year are annualized. 


Monthly Performance
Philosophy
We believe that by avoiding the “style box” trap and having the flexibility to invest in multiple classes of bonds, we can manage each portfolio in such a way as to emphasize the most attractive sector at any given time.  By strategically shifting out of overvalued assets, we strive to minimize potential risk and produce better returns over time.
Furthermore, our research has shown that the various sectors of the bond market behave differently under different economic conditions.  For instance, during periods of economic expansion, high yield and convertible bonds tend to perform well as rising corporate profits lead to improved credit profiles.  Conversely, they tend to perform very poorly during periods of economic contraction as credit profiles deteriorate.  During such recessionary periods, investment grade bonds generally prove to be better performers because of their responsiveness to declining interest rates.
Within particular sectors we choose individual securities based on rigorous fundamental and credit analysis.  We emphasize a thorough understanding of each company’s balance sheet by determining the company’s ability to generate recurring free cash flow from its operations.  As a result, we do a significant amount of work to determine the company’s business prospects as well as the positive and negative levers in its financial model, which influence the company’s ability to generate cash flow.  We believe that we find our best investments in companies that have great products, a competitive advantage that gives them pricing power in the market, a consistent operating history, and management that operate the company as if they own it.  Finally, we determine what we believe to be the appreciation potential versus the downside risk to gauge the attractiveness of the security versus other available investment opportunities.
Over time, we expect the maturity structure, credit quality, and sector concentration of the portfolio will differ during periods of economic contraction versus economic expansion.  In short, we will employ a strategy based on the belief that over the long term positive returns can be achieved, and losses minimized, through careful security selection and by shifting the allocation among fixed income sectors.

Philosophy
We employ a risk-averse investment strategy predicated on the belief that strong long-term investment results are best achieved through a compounding of reasonable gains and the avoidance of major losses.  We, therefore, consciously strive to limit downside exposure as much as to generate upside returns.
We focus on out-of-favor, undervalued situations with low P/E, P/B and P/FCF ratios and strong or rapidly improving cash flow dynamics.  We seek to avoid fads and speculatively priced stocks, where the risk of mistakes is high.
We continually search for under-researched, growth situations that can be purchased for modest multiples.  As such companies gain recognition and are accorded multiples more in line with their growth rates, we may become sellers.  We also tend to focus on asset rich companies with improving earning prospects.  In short we often follow the old saying, “Buy assets, sell earnings.”  This tends to reduce the risk of earnings disappointments.
Underlying everything we do is an intense focus on cash flow, especially a company’s ability to generate free cash flow after all expenses and capital spending.  Cash flow is more real than reported earnings, which are subject to accounting manipulation.  Companies that generate strong free cash flow are able to repay debt, repurchase shares, and grow through acquisitions or reinvestment in their businesses.  They are also attractive acquisition targets for both other companies and financial buyers.  Because of these characteristics, companies with rising free cash flow are often better able to grow, regardless of stock market conditions and, at the same time, may offer downside protection during periods of market weakness.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.



Rates of return for periods greater than one year are annualized.  The information given for these composites is historic and should not be taken as an indication of future performance.  Performance returns are presented both before and after the deduction of advisory fees.  Account returns are calculated monthly, using a time weighted return method.  Account returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and the deduction of brokerage fees and other commissions, if any, but do not reflect the deduction of certain other expenses such as custodial fees.  Monthly composite returns are calculated by weighting account returns by beginning market value.  Net returns reflect the deduction of actual advisory fees.



The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (“S&P 500”) is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring U.S. stock market performance. This index does not incur expenses and is not available for investment.  Index returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends.  The S&P 500 Index data are provided for comparison of the composite’s performance to the performance of the stock market in general.  The S&P 500 Index performance is not, however, directly comparable to the composites’ performance because accounts in the composites generally invest by using a portfolio of 30-40 stocks and the S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index that is widely regarded as the standard for measuring U.S. stock market performance.  



The fee schedule is as follows:  1.25% on the first $10 million, 1.00% on the next $15 million up to $25 million, and 0.75% in excess of $25 million.  A discounted rate is available for tax-free institutions, eleemosynary accounts and large institutions.



Clients invested in separately managed core equity accounts are subject to various risks including potential loss of principal, general market risk, small and medium-sized company risk, foreign securities and emerging markets risk and default risk.  For a complete discussion of the risks involved, please see our Form ADV Brochure and refer to Item 8.



The Core Equity Composite includes all fee-paying separately managed accounts that are predominantly invested in equity securities, and for which OCM has the discretion to increase and decrease equity exposure in an effort to reduce risk. The non-equity portion of the account may be invested in cash equivalents, fixed income securities, or mutual funds. Individual account performance will vary from the composite performance due to differences in individual holdings, cash flows, etc.



The Core Equity Fully Invested Composite includes all fee-paying separately managed accounts that are predominantly invested in equity securities.  OCM has discretion over individual investments but does not normally exercise asset class allocation discretion in these accounts.  Accounts normally remain close to 95% invested in equity securities, except in times of unusual market stress when a more defensive allocation may be deemed prudent.  Individual account performance will vary from the composite performance due to differences in individual holdings, cash flows, etc.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
