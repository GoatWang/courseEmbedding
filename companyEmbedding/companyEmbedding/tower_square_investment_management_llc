Company Description


Tower Square Investment Management Tower Square Investment Management (TSIM) creates, manages, rebalances and reallocates portfolios that consist of but are not limited to stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, ETFs, closed-end funds, and ADRs. The firm's management style is based on their attitude toward risk management. TSIM seeks to protect their clients' investments and help them grow more effectively. Their goal is to lose less in a “down” market, but this typically means they will not gain as much in an “up” market. TSIM believes that markets change over time. The firm actively researches market movement and adjusts their strategies accordingly. Their diverse strategies give clients access to invest in a variety of asset classes. TSIM's approach allows them to change weightings across industries as they see fit.
