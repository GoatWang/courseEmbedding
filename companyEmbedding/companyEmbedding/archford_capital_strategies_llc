Our Affilates
Our Advantages
Wealth management requires not only expertise and focus, but an enormous range of resources to structure the most effective financial plans and investment portfolios. As an independent firm, establishing partnerships with some of the leading names in finance allows us to provide clients with the breadth of resources they expect, but in a much more efficient way. By leveraging these relationships on your behalf, we can offer solutions from portfolio manager selection, trading, proprietary research, alternative investments and more.
By outsourcing services which are not our core capabilities – back office functions and technology – we’re free to do what we do best: spend time serving you, your family and your business; structuring solid wealth management plans and managing investment portfolios that enhance your success.

Wealth Management
Archford’s Advisor Standard of Excellence
 

 
Archford brings a highly experienced independent team that we believe is necessary to truly provide a complete financial response to life’s events.  We understand your financial decisions are much larger than just hold, buy, or sell.  Our team has the background and knowledge to develop creative solutions to life’s financial events.



 
 



 
Independence - Because your best interests are our primary interest, we’ve determined that being an independent firm puts us in a better position to ensure that your needs are being served first and foremost, using the widest platform of products and services, and access to the best investments and expertise available. Being independent allows us the freedom to concentrate on enhancing our clients’ experience while simultaneously helping build their financial futures.Experience - We have surpassed 20 professional designations on our team, including two Chartered Financial Analysts (CFA). The caliber and count of these 20 designations available to your business and family would rival any offering in the industry.Complete Access – Each Client has complete access to the entire team and the full range of expertise that comes with Archford.  We don’t just manage your portfolio, our highly experienced and diversified team guides you through your entire life’s financial events.  Fiduciary - Our Fiduciary Standard of Excellence requires us to hold our client’s needs above our own.  Not all financial advisors have a fiduciary responsibility, which we believe is critical to our best in class customer partnership.  We have established our own Investment Policy Committee, which includes Jim Maher, John Russo, Jerry West, Will Davis, and Chad Stafko. Our investment selection process includes our own direct manager research in addition to our unique access to institutional investment manager reviews.
