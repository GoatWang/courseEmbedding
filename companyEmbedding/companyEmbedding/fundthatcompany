While almost all the media attention in crowdfunding goes to mega platforms like
Kickstarter and Indiegogo, there are hundreds of other crowdfunding websites in
the marketplace. According to Statista (statista.com -2012) there are 454
crowdfunding platforms worldwide and of those 191 were located in the United
States. Other crowdfunding platforms included GoFundMe, GoGetFunding, Patreon,
Tubestart, Pozible and Rockethub to name a few.

A comparison of the two main players (Kickstarter and Indiegogo) in the
rewards-based crowding funding platforms is as follows (beebom.com 04/2015);

Comparison Factor          Kickstarter       Indiegogo

Projects launched          224,701           44,498       
Total Pledges              21.8 million      5 million    

Both of these platforms are widely respected and are arguably the leaders on the
growing crowdfunding industry. A growing number of niche players are growing
throughout the world, providing even more competition.


Company Description
FundThatCompany ("FTC") proposes to establish a rewards-based on-line
crowdfunding platform. According to the Oxford Dictionary Crowdfunding is, "the
practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small amounts of money
from a large number of people, typically via the Internet:


 musicians,
filmmakers, and artists have successfully raised funds and fostered awareness
through crowdfunding." FTC plans to offer small startup businesses or
entrepreneurs to post a project available for funding on FTC's proposed
reward-based crowdfunding platform. In return for backing a project,
backers/pledge donors receive different rewards (defined by the business or
entrepreneur) depending on the amount of funding they commit. Our platform will
focus on projects that are stipulated categories including; renewable energy,
art, music, film, books, fashion, food and technologies. FTC intends to offer a
wide range of tools and tips to help businesses or entrepreneurs execute a
successful rewards-based funding campaign. FTC plans to offer the options of
"all-or-nothing" or "keep everything" funding models. In the "all-or-nothing"
model project creators choose a specific amount of money in advance (the
goal/target). The project only succeeds and money only changes hands if this
amount is reached within a particular time frame. In the "keep everything" model
project creators keep all funds even if the crowdfunding target is not reached.
Project creators will have a 100% control over their products and services. Our
platform will not permit contributors to become investors or shareholders, nor
can they qualify as accredited investors to participate in any financial
returns.

FundThatCompany ("FTC") is an early stage company that intends to focus on a
rewards-based crowdfunding model. FTC does not intend to curate the projects
that it hosts. We plan to position ourselves as an inclusive community that does
not decide which projects merit funding. FTC will allow a wide range of
categories and whether a project gets funded is up to potential supporters. In
addition FTC will not pick projects to promote on our site. That is not to say
that anything goes in terms of launching projects. In order to launch a campaign
on FTC's site the presenter must conform to FTC's Term on Use. These would
include but not limited to things like being over the age of 18, not offering
alcohol or weapons as a reward and not using the site to disparage other
individuals or companies. Project creators will have a 100% control over their
products and services. Our platform will not permit contributors to become
investors or shareholders, nor can they qualify as accredited investors to
participate in any financial returns.

The key to success will be the Company's ability to differentiate ourselves from
all other rewards-based crowdfunding platforms. This will be a difficult task,
we will need to not only gain market acceptance of our platform, but be able
standout from the crowd in our brand recognition. To help we will include on our
proposed platform advice, references and tools to assist project providers in;
making a video; templates to summarize a campaign page; suggestions on setting a
funding goal and deadline; suggestions on marketing a project to pledge donors;
suggestions on rewards and perks. Offering great rewards by project providers is
one of the best ways to encourage support for a project. Depending on the type
of project being offered often determines the type of reward being offered. This
could include copies on what the project is making, signed prints, tickets to
the project show and things like T-shirts and totes. Rewards that have been
offered in KickStarter and Indiegogo rewards-based projects have include bike
tours, studio visits, food photography, script scraps, fifteen minutes of
podcast fame, dinner for two, bumper stickers, handcrafted mugs, sheet music,
backstage passes, headwear such as beanies, handwritten postcards, cool
calendars to name just a few.

Providing tools to assist projects is important but we believe to really achieve
brand recognition we will need to market our proposed platform in a distinct
non-traditional way via clever streaming videos, social media and mainstream
advertising within the United States. We intend to stress the excitement and fun
of presenting projects on our proposed site. We plan to offer more support and
guidance for our customers and pledge donors. We hope that our proposed site
will eventually become a community over time. In the end the key to success of
our proposed rewards-base crowdfunding platform will be the quality of projects
that we attract to our site. The more successful the projects the more
recognition for our platform. We have not yet begun the development of our
website but have procured a web domain name of "FundThatCompany.com".

During the next 12 months, FundThatCompany intends to continue its ongoing
research and marketing plan by attending two tradeshows/conferences; The One
Spark festival held once a year (in Jacksonville, Florida in April 2016). The
other conference we have targeted is the Renewable Energy Conference to be held
in London, UK in November of 2016. We also intend to develop a unique logo. We
will also source third-party companies to assist us in social media and
traditional marketing; and setting up the company's on-line platform website and
begin to market our proposed rewards-based crowdfunding product.
---

There is the likelihood that we may never be able to gain acceptance of our
proposed rewards-based crowdfunding platform in the marketplace that the Company
would need to successfully complete its plan of operation and develop and
implement the Company's web-site platform. If our company is not capable of
building a market for its proposed product, all funds that we spend on
development will be lost.
---

We were incorporated under the laws of Nevada effective September 4, 2015. Our
principal business offices are 555/114 Moo 9, Sattahip District, Chonburi,
20180, Kingdom of Thailand and our telephone number is (877) 451-0120.

Introduction to Investing




Many people just like you turn to the markets to help buy a home, send children to college, or build a retirement nest egg. But unlike the banking world, where deposits are guaranteed by federal deposit insurance, the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities fluctuates with market conditions. No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments, and they may lose value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission. We cannot tell you what investments to make, but this website provides unbiased information to help you evaluate your choices and protect yourself against fraud.

But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.

Mutual Funds

What are mutual funds?
A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and short-term debt. The combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio. Investors buy shares in mutual funds. Each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund and the income it generates.

Why do people buy mutual funds?
Mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following features:
Professional Management. The fund managers do the research for you. They select the securities and monitor the performance.
Diversification or “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Mutual funds typically invest in a range of companies and industries. This helps to lower your risk if one company fails.
Affordability. Most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and subsequent purchases.
Liquidity. Mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time, for the current net asset value (NAV) plus any redemption fees.
What types of mutual funds are there?
Most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories – money market funds, bond funds, stock funds, and target date funds. Each type has different features, risks, and rewards.
Money market funds have relatively low risks. By law, they can invest only in certain high-quality, short-term investments issued by U.S. corporations, and federal, state and local governments.
Bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns. Because there are many different types of bonds, the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically.
Stock funds invest in corporate stocks. Not all stock funds are the same. Some examples are:
		Growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for above-average financial gains.
Income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends.
Index funds track a particular market index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment.

Target date funds hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy. Target date funds, sometimes known as lifecycle funds, are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.
What are the benefits and risks of mutual funds?
Mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification. They also offer three ways to earn money:
Dividend Payments. A fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income, less expenses.
Capital Gains Distributions. The price of the securities in a fund may increase. When a fund sells a security that has increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of the year, the fund distributes these capital gains, minus any capital losses, to investors.
Increased NAV. If the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases, after deducting expenses, then the value of the fund and its shares increases. The higher NAV reflects the higher value of your investment.
All funds carry some level of risk. With mutual funds, you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value. Dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change.
A fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns. But past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time. The more volatile the fund, the higher the investment risk.
How to buy and sell mutual funds
Investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund, rather than from other investors. The price that investors pay for the mutual fund is the fund’s per share net asset value plus any fees charged at the time of purchase, such as sales loads.
Mutual fund shares are “redeemable,” meaning investors can sell the shares back to the fund at any time. The fund usually must send you the payment within seven days.
Before buying shares in a mutual fund, read the prospectus carefully. The prospectus contains information about the mutual fund’s investment objectives, risks, performance, and expenses. See How to Read a Mutual Fund Prospectus Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 to learn more about key information in a prospectus.
Understanding fees
As with any business, running a mutual fund involves costs. Funds pass along these costs to investors by charging fees and expenses. Fees and expenses vary from fund to fund. A fund with high costs must perform better than a low-cost fund to generate the same returns for you.
Even small differences in fees can mean large differences in returns over time. For example, if you invested $10,000 in a fund with a 10% annual return, and annual operating expenses of 1.5%, after 20 years you would have roughly $49,725. If you invested in a fund with the same performance and expenses of 0.5%, after 20 years you would end up with $60,858.
It takes only minutes to use a mutual fund cost calculator to compute how the costs of different mutual funds add up over time and eat into your returns. See the Mutual Fund Glossary for types of fees.
Avoiding fraud
By law, each mutual fund is required to file a prospectus and regular shareholder reports with the SEC. Before you invest, be sure to read the prospectus and the required shareholder reports. Additionally, the investment portfolios of mutual funds are managed by separate entities know as “investment advisers” that are registered with the SEC. Always check that the investment adviser is registered before investing.

Prior to making any material changes to a mutual fund, any number of approvals are required and I am responsible for preparing and presenting the proposed changes to the requisite committees or boards.If the mutual fund manager (or another person at the firm) would like to make a change -- in a fund's investment objective, for example, or the benchmark the fund is compared to -- it's my duty, first, to make sure I understanding what's being proposed and then  to conduct some research to determine what the impact will be on the mutual fund shareholders (who actually own the fund; the management company I work for is essentially only a servant).After I've prepared my analysis, I manage the preparation of the documents which will be used to discuss the proposed changes to the various company committees and mutual fund board trustees.  All of these groups will have to analyze the changes and determine whether they're in the best interests of the shareholders.  The fund board trustees, especially, are required to look out for the shareholders; if they approve the changes the changes will be filed with the SEC and shareholders will be notified.  If not, though, nothing can be altered.The groups we work with include the legal department, portfolio managers, the sales and marketing departments, the performance team, the shareholder services team and others.
Best and Worst Parts of the Job: The best part of my job, the thing about it I like is the people: the friendships I've made.  No matter where you go, it's the people who make or break the job.  You can make a ton of money, but hate the job because you do not like anyone (or no one likes you).  You spend more time with your co-workers than with your family, so get into a mix of good people and you will likely be happy.The worst part?  Asset management is a very difficult business to be in right now -- lots of uncertainty and layoffs.  The absence  of prosperity and, more than that, of market optimism have made my job very trying.
Job Tips: 1. Be certain that you have a real passion for business or industry.
2. Educate yourself.
3. Maintain a database of contacts and references throughout your career.
4. Do not burn bridges, no matter how badly you would like to.  You never know who will know whom when you are interviewing for the next job, whether within your firm or outside it.
Additional Thoughts: Important qualities or traits:
 -- You need to be extremely flexible.  Priorities can change very quickly at times, and you have to be able to juggle tasks and adapt to a changing environment.-- You need to be well versed in technology.  Computer systems and software programs are the name of the game.--You need to continue to study and educate yourself to remain relevant especially when it comes to technology, terminology, business experience and understanding of the industry

FEATURED CHART
The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

			If your goal is to generate income from your investments, explore these model portfolios.

Get started




















A path toward an income-generating portfolio
As an investor, you have your own knowledge of funds, tolerance for risk, and preference for asset allocation. Matching your unique financial situation to a particular goal—such as investing for growth and income—requires research and strategy.
To help you craft or adjust your investment approach, we've developed three models of income-generating portfolios: Conservative Income, Balanced Income, and Growth Income.
These portfolios emphasize interest and dividend income as a component of total return for a given level of investment risk. While the primary focus of the portfolios is to provide income, the underlying mutual funds continue to seek growth of capital over the long term.
 Make the models work for you 
Start by assessing your current circumstances and your short- and long-term financial goals; then compare and contrast the three model portfolios.
Review the methodology document (PDF) to learn how these models were created. This information can help inform your research into each individual fund, as well as into other funds, including non-Fidelity funds.
Use these model portfolios to help you research investments, refine your existing portfolio, and even build your own income-focused portfolio.

The Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income represent three distinct income‐focused model portfolios (Conservative–Income, Balanced–Income, and Growth–Income) consistent with different levels of long-term risk.

								  The primary objective of the Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income is to provide a representation of just one way you might construct a portfolio of Fidelity mutual funds, designed for the purpose of providing a focus on interest and dividend income, over a range of long term risk levels, which are consistent with the asset allocations of a (sub)set of Fidelity’s Target Asset Mixes (TAMs). The Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income represent three distinct income‐focused model portfolios (Conservative–Income, Balanced–Income, and Growth–Income) consistent with different levels of long-term risk. To learn more about our model portfolios, please see our methodology (PDF).

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


          Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.
	
    

          Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
	
    

          Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
	
    

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.
	
    

          Fidelity's guidance is educational and should not be the primary basis of your investment decisions. Please see themodel portfolio methodology (PDF) for more information about how the models are created. You should also carefully research any fund you may be considering prior to making an investment decision. You may consider another allocation and other investments, including non‐Fidelity funds, having similar risk and return characteristics may be available.
	
    

          We can change or update the model portfolios at any time. Fidelity will not notify you when they are updated. The model portfolios may contain taxable bond funds. The model portfolios do not attempt to consider the effect of income taxes on performance or returns and does not reflect any opinion on the tax‐appropriateness of the portfolio for any investor. Depending on your tax situation, municipal bond funds may be more appropriate for you. Model portfolios do not consider the effect of taxes, fees and/or expenses associated with investing. Please consult with your investment or tax advisor, if applicable, prior to taking action.
	
    

          In applying the model portfolio or any other results to your individual situation, be sure to consider other assets, income and investments (e.g., home equity, savings accounts or other retirement accounts) in addition to assets designated for this goal. The model portfolios are not designed to maximize return or predict the highest performing funds.

These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors.

          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

 IRAs (Traditional and Roth) 
 

















































  



























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date.
