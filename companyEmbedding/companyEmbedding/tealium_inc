About Tealium, Inc.






Tealium is the leader in customer data solutions and enterprise tag management. Our technology enables digital marketers to more easily deploy and manage mission-critical solutions, while also empowering them to more effectively listen and act on customer behaviors in real time.
The Company was founded in 2008 by two former executives at WebSideStory, a pioneering SaaS-based web analytics provider that is now part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud, via acquisitions by Omniture and Adobe Systems. At WebSideStory, Tealium co-founders Ali Behnam and Mike Anderson oversaw optimization consulting and web analytics implementations for major brands worldwide, giving them first-hand insight and experience into the issues surrounding the implementation of JavaScript tag-based online marketing solutions. In 2011, the Company debuted its first enterprise version, Tealium iQ, which set new industry benchmarks for ease of use and fast, scalable architecture.
Today, Tealium continues to lead the space with its tag management product and has introduced additional products that allow marketers to act in real-time on customer behavior as well as fuel their data analytics initiatives. The world’s leading brands trust Tealium’s technology and the Company is widely recognized for its innovation and leadership by industry analysts. In addition, Tealium consistently receives top ratings and reviews from users for its technology and customer service.
Our Customer Relations Philosophy
Tealium’s most important goal is customer success. Our customers are not software users; they are using Tealium as the catalyst to reach new heights in their customer data initiatives and marketing programs, as well as their individual careers. Their success truly is our success. And let’s face it, without them we would not be here. Therefore, please observe the following guidelines:

CUSTOMERS are the most important people in our business, whether we are dealing with them in person, online, over the telephone, or building software for them;
CUSTOMERS are not dependent on us. We are dependent on them;
CUSTOMERS are not an interruption of our work. They are the purpose for it;
CUSTOMERS favor us with their patronage. We are not doing them a favor by serving them;
CUSTOMERS are a part of our business. They are not outsiders;
CUSTOMERS are not cold statistics. They are human beings with feelings and emotions like our own;
CUSTOMERS are not someone to argue with or match wits with;
CUSTOMERS are deserving of the most courteous and attentive treatment we can give them; and
CUSTOMERS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR BUSINESS.
