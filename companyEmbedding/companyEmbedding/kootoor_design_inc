Prominence is the key concept with the SEC’s new guidance for earnings releases

Posted on July 22, 2016 | Leave a comment


This earnings season will be the first since the SEC’s May 17th revised C&DIs (Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations) guidance regarding the presentation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures in earnings releases.
SEC Chair White recently spoke of having noteworthy concerns about issuers who present non-GAAP measures “too far and beyond what is intended and allowed by the SEC’s rules” and “troublesome practices which can make non-GAAP disclosures misleading.” Lets tag them as the bad non-GAAPles.
The SEC is aware that just a few bad non-GAAPles have ruined the whole batch
To address this, the SEC has issued new and updated CD&Is regarding non-GAAP measures. The new and revised C&DIs do not represent a formal rule change. However, they are a warning signal to issuers and absolutely demonstrate the SEC’s concerns regarding inappropriate adjustments presented by companies on their non-GAAP financial measures. The SEC is watching earnings releases closely.
Much of the new guidance is strategic if not “philosophical” around the actual measures that an issuer uses to calculation their earnings and guidance. That’s for the Audit Committee to work on. Tactically, the SEC called-out some non-GAAP disclosure presentation practices that are common in earnings releases. The bottomline is that issuers cannot disclosure their results in manner that places undue prominence on the non-GAAP numbers.
“Prominence” is the key concept here. Earnings release practices that the SEC has specified as non-acceptable include:

Presenting a non-GAAP measure before its most directly comparable GAAP measure – including within an earnings release headline or caption


Presenting a non-GAAP measure using a style of presentation (e.g., bold, larger font) that emphasizes the non-GAAP measure over the comparable GAAP measure


Omitting comparable GAAP measures from an earnings release headline or caption that includes non-GAAP measures


Presenting a full income statement of non-GAAP measures or presenting a full non-GAAP income statement when reconciling non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures


Providing discussion and analysis of a non-GAAP measure without a similar discussion and analysis of the comparable GAAP measure in a location with equal or greater prominence.

To mitigate risk of non-compliance, issuers that plan to present non-GAAP financial measures in their earnings releases may need to modify their disclosure practices. Chair White strongly urged issuers to consider the updated guidance and “revisit their approach to non-GAAP disclosures.”
Although the SEC is uber-focused on earnings releases with this new guidance, the SEC also urges issuers to uphold these new guidelines in their non-earnings (EDGAR filed) shareholder communications such as in presentations to investors and analysts, annual reports and IR websites. Issuers should communicate with shareholders in a consistent manner – the stock narrative told outside of the SEC filings should be the same as the narrative found within in the issuer’s SEC filings.
By now, hopefully IROs have had in-depth conversations with their corporate securities lawyers. NIRI members should listen to the educational webinar.

Hey WSJ, it’s 2016. Time to stop calling individual investors ‘Mom-and-Pop.’

Posted on July 21, 2016 | Leave a comment


.
On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal ran an article titled Companies Forgot About Mom­-and-­Pop Investors …Until Now. You can read it here.(if you are subscribed)
Last Thursday’s VirtualInvestorConferences.com event brought 1,500 investors online to listen to CEO’s as well as to an education breakout session on the impact of Brexit for individual investors. During these online roadshow presentations, over 300 questions were asked by investors directly to CEOs.
Does this type of activity fit the Grant Woodesque “Mom-and-Pop” narrative?
No, it does not – nor has it ever since we launched our online non-deal roadshow portal in 2010. 65 conferences ago. Since then, we’ve had 40K plus investors log-in and pose questions to hundreds of companies, ranging from mega-cap to new generation RegA+ registrants.
What we have experienced since 2010:

We refer to this audience as individual investors or, if feeling casual, “Main Street” investors juxtaposed to “Wall Street.”


We dropped the label “retail Investors” as it implied a “shopping mentality” rather than a strategic persona.


We changed the name of the portal from “retailinvstorconferences… to virtualinvestorconfeences to demonstrate the leveling of all investors.


Since 2012, our exclusive study of “How Investors Consume Investor Relations Content” has received 40,000 unique answers from individual investors. You can request the 2016 report here.


A major stock exchange and a global ADR bank, both recognizing the impact any investor can have on a stock, use our portal to bring their listed clients to the online investing public.

In defense of the WSJ, their article was great. It spoke about how individual investors can be a critical constituency during a contested proxy battle. It reinforces the point that even though Main Street investors are a small percentage of your holding parties, taking a small effort to build a relationship with them may save management. Individual investors generally vote with management.
Looking for a smart example of corporate dedication towards individual investors? AFLAC has presented each and every quarter since 2010. It’s a steadfast tile in their shareholder communications mosaic.

REPORT: 90% of institutional investors visit IR websites before they take a stock position

Posted on July 20, 2016 | Leave a comment


From a simple marketing perspective, an investor relations website is not dissimilar to a trade show booth. You never know when a prospect is going to walk by and make a purely visceral judgment. In the case of an institutional investor, it must be a surface-level, emotional “kicking-of-the-tires’ as they already have access to all your past performance data as well as in-depth analysts’ reports. They want to understand how you represent your “financial brand.”
Combine this information with the first question in our study, and there is no question about the need to have an IR website to build confidence with Wall Street.

Here are some examples of the sites we host: we can build a variety of design formats – at a variety of service packages to fit into a budget.

Posted in 2017: How Investors Consume IR Content (Wall v Main Streets) 



IR should not be concerned about lack of social media control – but of consistency

Posted on July 19, 2016 | 1 comment


.
This is more of an update rather than a core discussion. By now, investor relations have expressed their collective “meh” for using social media with any of the verve demonstrated by their comrades on PR or marketing teams. Mostly, the IR consensus is that their audience is not using social media as a corporate information point.
The attitude often written in this blog towards IR and social media has been steadfast: it’s a tile in the mosaic of shareholder communications.
To keep on the topic from the headline above, this discussion hits on the SEC’s 2013 guidance accepting social media as a Reg FD disclosure point. This month, there are two wrinkles that have impact on “if” social media is a tool in a corporate disclosure policy:
Facebook…
…has adjusted their algorithm “to help make sure you don’t miss the friends and family posts you are likely to care about, we put those posts toward the top of your News Feed.”

This means any consistent posting to Facebook is effectively annulled. Facebook is not a linear time-based news feed. You can never prevent – or confirm – that Investor A is not seeing your news before Investor B. This may not be selective disclosure by intent, but is it rather flibberty jibberty.

Yahoo!Finance…
…has removed Twitter and StockTwits from their newly designed portal. This is disappointing for a few reasons:

 The sheer amount of $CASHTAGGED traffic of your news and shareholder-shared discussions will noticeably drop. Our weekly IPO traffic has already experienced that, as we use $cashtags weekly.


The “conversations,” although labeled with a social media $cashtag seem to simply be the Yahoo chat boards – which, as always, are ripe with unmonitored pump-and-dump…


…which StockTwits did not allow in their feed. In fact, they proactively police their feed/portal. Their members are passionate day-traders, not pumpers.

.
Neither of these two points will have any meaningful impact on most IR teams. However, it does clearly demonstrate that social media platforms are independent businesses – and their businesses are NOT interested in consistent – not to mention simultaneous – disclosure of material information to shareholders.

Reg A+ it and they will come. Kinda sorta.

Posted on July 14, 2016 | Leave a comment


Excellent recap of Reg A+ in the WSJ.
“According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, 94 companies had filed to raise a total of $1.7 billion under Reg A+ as of early June. Of those, 45 offerings seeking to raise a total of $785 million have qualified to raise funds, and just a few have actually completed their offerings.
The low tally highlights some of the challenges that small companies continue to face, as well as the JOBS Act’s limited progress in achieving its objectives. But the weak market for initial public offerings hasn’t helped.
.

,
Among the biggest problems for the companies trying to raise funds is that they aren’t prepared for the amount of marketing needed to attract a big enough pool of potential investors.”
That last paragraph is the most germane to this blog. Vintage is the #1 Reg A+ filing agent, by far. We’ve seen our share of companies file their 1-A… and many have yet to meet their expectations. And that word – expectations – is certainly where the problem may lay. RegA+ is just a year old. To imagine seasoned “players” to walk out of the corn is not the expectation to set. RegA+ is NOT the new shell or reverse merger… there is no “get-rich-quick” path here. It’s called a mini-IPO for a simple reason – it requires the same business fortitude found with traditional IPO (form S-1) event.
That said, let’s look at a year by the numbers:

94 companies
$1.7 billion
5 offerings qualified
A few have actually completed their offerings

94 companies is one every 2.75 business days! $6,500,000 raised every business day! That seems like great progress for a one-year-old!   It’s much too soon to judge a “completion” rate – as he vast amount of variables that propel any company’s success is vast: marketing, management, products and promise. But the top of the funnel is strong.
Coincidentally, (ahem) one company that is the poster child for Reg A+ success is presenting live today to an audience of live, online investors at virtualinvestorconferences.com.

Elio Motors has put all the right pieces in place for a successful Reg A+ IPO, but most essentially, marketing. One example is they reached into their database of enthusiastic motor-fans to create “investomers.” Learn more, free. Their CEO is presenting live at 1:00 PM ET.
Following in Elios’ marketing footprint (but presenting 45 minutes earlier ) is ShiftPixy. You can read their offering prospectus here.
To close out using more baseball metaphors, a Reg A+ filing was not built to be a home run. At best, it’s a base hit – and management needs to work diligently to bring the “mini-IPO” runner home, base by base, communication by communication. Reg A+ is less expensive than a normal IPO, but NOT less effort.

Marketing and investor relations: twin sons of different mothers

Posted on July 13, 2016 | Leave a comment


We recently published a whitepaper discussing what, in marketing parlance, is called “earned” media. Generally speaking, earned media is news mentions, social media shares & reposts and services reviews. This is always placed in discussion alongside paid media (ads, etc.) and owned media (corporate website, etc.).
For marketing, a company earns “earned” by creating great content (blogs, infographics, videos, press releases, webinar and whitepapers) that their audience proactively share. A simple (and artery damaging) example is when you liked and shared that video recipe for Buffalo Chicken Stuffed Baked Potato Skins recipe in Facebook.
How does this relate to investor relations, in context to “content?” Investor relations departments are the quintessential content marketers– specifically because they cannot embellish from the facts at all. They cannot buy ads* (paid media) promising benefits. What IR does is tell their corporate story – generally by offering a mosaic of facts (past performance), introduce the drivers (senior management) and then sit back and hope the customer (the investor) buys.
Let’s compare the tools:
In our marketing whitepaper, two graphs illustrated what 1,500 CMOs told us about the effectiveness of their communications: lead generation and brand building.  As you see, a lot of stuff in the marketing mosaic. What is obvious is that the marketing tools deemed most effective by CMOs – upper right quadrant – are the same tools that IROs have always used. This became very apparent when the marketing vocabulary is replaced with IR vocabulary.
The charts with the orange dots are the original marketing charts. Clicking on any of the four charts will enlarge them.


Same chart with superimposed IR vocabulary. Extra stuff removed.



Same chart with superimposed IR vocabulary. Extra stuff removed.


The mosaic theory is not new to IR. It is newer to us product marketers, mostly as social media has given us a stronger opportunity to build our own publishing network in balance with existing traditional channels. Thank you interwebs!
If you are interested in what media your investors favor, I suggest this whitepaper.

And yes, I appreciate the irony of this earned media in a blog about earned media.

How to engage with investors in the age of the activist: dealing with CEO compensation

Posted on July 12, 2016 | Leave a comment


Investors have learned that it pays to be aggressive when it comes to boardroom fights. As a result, companies are preparing for activist campaigns well in advance.

THIS IS PART FIVE OF A SERIES: read Part Four.

QUESTION > Publishing CEO compensation and its ratio to “regular employees” goes into effect next year. What risks – and subsequent mitigation – are you expecting to address?
Lex Suvanto > First of all, CEO compensation already gets a lot of scrutiny. For companies with management teams that are paid high salaries, or salaries that are much higher than peer companies, they get a lot of attention – it’s a big reputational issue. The new rule regarding the ratio of CEO pay to employee pay isn’t going to put CEO compensation into the limelight all of a sudden, because it already is in the limelight. The ratio is going to make it more so, however, and it is going to make it easier to compare companies apples-to-apples. It’s also going to give stakeholder groups and constituents such as employees and labor groups more ammunition for negotiations and generating media attention.
I think CEOs and boards are going to be more sensitive as a result of this rule. They are probably going to use it as an opportunity to think more carefully about how they communicate this information and what the substantiation is for it.
Kai Haakon E. Liekefett > Like many practitioners, I think this rule is a very good example of a well-meant regulation that causes nothing but an enormous amount of work and a significant waste of money.
When you calculate the amount of money that corporate America is going to spend on this, you’d be shocked. Companies will have to determine what a “regular employee” is, and while that’s easy when you have 20 employees, it is much more challenging when you have 30,000 employees worldwide on very different compensation scales. You also need to figure out what you count as compensation, for both the CEO and employees. It’s an enormous calculation that will cost millions for large companies. And the output is an arbitrary number that says 1:30, 1:50, 1:70, something like that, which is going to be used primarily for one reason – for activists to argue that the CEO is overpaid.
Activists are all over this and will use it to undermine the credibility of management in their pursuit of profit.
Chris Ruggieri > One certainty when it comes to the CEO compensation ratio is that there will be some stark differences between industries. If you take an industry like fast food, where you have a lot of entry-level jobs, you’re going to have a much bigger multiple than in certain other industries.
So like any type of data, it has to be interpreted – you have to put the number in context. It will provide additional information in the marketplace, however.  Just like with the “say on pay” rule, people will be looking for outliers and if they see them, it will begin to stimulate some discussion.

I suspect you will have some knee-jerk reactions and outrage over certain multiples that appear to be very high. On the other hand, the board should be asking questions if they observe differences between companies in their industry peer group. It’s like any information – you’re going to analyze it, and if you notice trends or differences, it’s going to cause you to ask questions. I think it is incumbent upon executive management and the board to be mindful of that.
Jason M. Halper > One of the main risks regarding the CEO compensation ratio is the question of whether to provide additional narrative around the disclosure. You are permitted to do so under the SEC rule, but if you do provide additional narrative, you need to be careful not to make any false or misleading statements. You also need to consider whether you’re opening up a further can of worms by devoting more pages to it.
Since the rule is not in effect yet, companies don’t know how they’re going to compare with their peers. So there is a lot of uncertainty regarding whether to put narrative around it – you have to be careful, at least in the first year you do it. Initially, I think any optional disclosure would be on the side of explaining the elements that led to the number. So, for a company that has many seasonal workers, for instance, that may drive the ratio higher. That is a fact-based disclosure that could be made, as opposed to a more qualitative or high-level disclosure.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
