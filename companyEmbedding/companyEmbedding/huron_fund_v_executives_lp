NEW YORK, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sixpoint Partners, a leading global investment bank serving the middle market, today announced the successful closing of The Huron Fund V L.P. ("Fund" or "Fund V"), with $550 million of total limited partner capital commitments. The Fund, which is the sixth investment vehicle for Huron Capital Partners ("Huron"), closed at its hard cap and in excess of its $500 million target. Receiving commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices, the Fund closed after just three months of marketing and was oversubscribed with over $1 billion of demand. 








Like its predecessor, The Huron Fund IV L.P., which also closed above its target at $500 million of capital commitments in 2013, Fund V will seek to utilize Huron's operationally-focused, buy-and-build approach to identify and acquire fundamentally-sound companies and build them into leaders. The Fund will seek control transactions in the lower middle market with valuations generally under $200 million and will focus on committing a total of $20 million to $70 million per transaction. The firm is led by its senior partners, Brian Demkowicz, Michael Beauregard, John Higgins and Peter Mogk. 
"We deeply value the tremendous confidence and broad support that our new and existing investors have placed with our experienced investment team and remain focused on delivering strong returns to our LP base," said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner at Huron. "We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions."
"With over $1 billion of demand for Fund V, we believe Huron's 16-year track record drove robust demand from investors for its disciplined investment process and proven strategy," said Eric Zoller, Partner at Sixpoint Partners. "Huron is an excellent representative of Sixpoint's exceptional relationships in the lower middle market for our LPs." 
Larry Smith, Partner at Sixpoint Partners added, "Given Huron's long track record and focus on attractive opportunities within the lower middle market, we expect Huron's oversubscribed fund to generate strong returns, and we look forward to continuing our partnership."

("Fund" or "Fund V"), with $550 million of total limited partner capital commitments. The Fund, which is the sixth investment vehicle for Huron Capital Partners ("Huron"), closed at its hard cap and in excess of its $500 million target. Receiving commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices, the Fund closed after just three months of marketing and was oversubscribed with over $1 billion of demand.Like its predecessor, The Huron Fund IV L.P., which also closed above its target at $500 million of capital commitments in 2013, Fund V will seek to utilize Huron's operationally-focused, buy-and-build approach to identify and acquire fundamentally-sound companies and build them into leaders. The Fund will seek control transactions in the lower middle market with valuations generally under $200 million and will focus on committing a total of $20 million to $70 million per transaction. The firm is led by its senior partners, Brian Demkowicz, Michael Beauregard, John Higgins and Peter Mogk."We deeply value the tremendous confidence and broad support that our new and existing investors have placed with our experienced investment team and remain focused on delivering strong returns to our LP base," said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner at Huron. "We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions.""With over $1 billion of demand for Fund V, we believe Huron's 16-year track record drove robust demand from investors for its disciplined investment process and proven strategy," said Eric Zoller, Partner at Sixpoint Partners.
