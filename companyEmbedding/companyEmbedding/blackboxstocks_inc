Business Wire




Nov 2, 2016 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































  Blackboxstocks Inc. (OTC:BLBX) ("Blackbox") announced today the closing of a private placement financing in the amount of US$ 1,500,000 consisting of the sale of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of US$ .50 per share. This transaction was completed on October 27 th, 2016 and is referenced in an 8-K filing dated October 27 th, 2016. The entire private placement round was purchased by Mr. Stephen Chiang, a resident of Singapore.  Stephen Chiang, age 33, is the founder of UNOChat Business Communication Platform, a division of UNO Ventures, a Singapore based corporation. UNOChat is a global platform that facilitates the promotion of business products and services through its social network.  "I am very pleased to announce the completion of this funding by Mr. Stephen Chiang," said Founder and CEO Gust Kepler. "Mr. Chiang has extensive knowledge and experience in the digital marketing arena and I believe he saw the enormous potential our technology has on a global scale!" added Kepler.  The majority of the proceeds from this financing are expected to be used for continued product development and marketing of the Blackboxstocks trading platform. Blackbox began an extensive beta testing program in June of 2016 and initiated a soft launch for paying subscribers in September 2016.  About Blackboxstocks Inc.  Blackboxstocks Inc. is a Nevada corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We develop real-time, web and mobile based analytical software tools for day traders and swing traders. Our servers, located in close proximity to the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, and OTC exchanges, drive our proprietary algorithms at near light speed. This allows our system to monitor and analyze over 13,000 stocks simultaneously. Our platform employs predictive technology enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that can result in the rapid change in a stock's price. The complexity of our backend analytics are neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to use interface/dashboard. Our mission is to provide our users accurate information in a quick and concise user friendly format to enable them to take advantage of lucrative market opportunities. We intend to derive the majority of our revenue by selling monthly subscriptions while other ancillary revenue sources may include referral fees and online advertising.

THE MOST USER FRIENDLY, FULLY AUTOMATED STOCK ANALYSIS TOOL ON THE MARKET!
  
Watch Our System In Action
 



JOIN NOW






THE ALERT SYSTEM
We have designed the most user friendly trading tool available!  Our system was created by high frequency traders to give you the upper hand in the market! We provide our users with an ultra-powerful, real-time alert system that is comprehensive but easy to understand. Our simple one page layout is easy to navigate and does not require custom configuration.   

  
The Unique Features of our System
  We find the action
We are distinctly different than any other system on the market. Our trading system automatically posts symbols alerting you to explosive opportunities in the market in real time.
How it works
Long before the market opens, our system uses proprietary algorithms that alert you to the most active stocks. Once an alert is posted, you can click on the symbol and find out why the stock received an alert. Use our live charting tool and proprietary volatility indicator to see which stocks are breaking out and posting the biggest gains.
A Powerful Advantage
Our system is composed of  high-speed servers, monitoring over +13,000 stocks at the same time, analyzing each tick multiple times per second. Our algorithms are similar to those used in extremely profitable ‘high frequency trading’ (HFT) strategies. We are here to level the playing field offering you technology that has too often been reserved for large financial firms, hedge funds, and the Wall Street elite.

Blackboxstocks Inc. Closes $1.5 Million Private Placement Financing






November 02, 2016 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blackboxstocks Inc. (OTC:BLBX) (“Blackbox”) announced today the closing 
      of a private placement financing in the amount of US$ 1,500,000 
      consisting of the sale of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of 
      US$ .50 per share. This transaction was completed on October 27th, 
      2016 and is referenced in an 8-K filing dated October 27th, 
      2016. The entire private placement round was purchased by Mr. Stephen 
      Chiang, a resident of Singapore.
    


      Stephen Chiang, age 33, is the founder of UNOChat Business Communication 
      Platform, a division of UNO Ventures, a Singapore based corporation. 
      UNOChat is a global platform that facilitates the promotion of business 
      products and services through its social network.
    

      “I am very pleased to announce the completion of this funding by Mr. 
      Stephen Chiang,” said Founder and CEO Gust Kepler. “Mr. Chiang has 
      extensive knowledge and experience in the digital marketing arena and I 
      believe he saw the enormous potential our technology has on a global 
      scale!” added Kepler.
    

      The majority of the proceeds from this financing are expected to be used 
      for continued product development and marketing of the Blackboxstocks 
      trading platform. Blackbox began an extensive beta testing program in 
      June of 2016 and initiated a soft launch for paying subscribers in 
      September 2016.

Watch Our System In Action

THE ALERT SYSTEM
We have designed the most user friendly trading tool available!  Our system was created by high frequency traders to give you the upper hand in the market! We provide our users with an ultra-powerful, real-time alert system that is comprehensive but easy to understand. Our simple one page layout is easy to navigate and does not require custom configuration.   

  
The Unique Features of our System
  We find the action
We are distinctly different than any other system on the market. Our trading system automatically posts symbols alerting you to explosive opportunities in the market in real time.
How it works
Long before the market opens, our system uses proprietary algorithms that alert you to the most active stocks. Once an alert is posted, you can click on the symbol and find out why the stock received an alert. Use our live charting tool and proprietary volatility indicator to see which stocks are breaking out and posting the biggest gains.
A Powerful Advantage
Our system is composed of  high-speed servers, monitoring over +13,000 stocks at the same time, analyzing each tick multiple times per second. Our algorithms are similar to those used in extremely profitable ‘high frequency trading’ (HFT) strategies. We are here to level the playing field offering you technology that has too often been reserved for large financial firms, hedge funds, and the Wall Street elite.
