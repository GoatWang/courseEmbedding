If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

SFO Facing Uncertain Future

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Friday, May 14, 2010 at 8:22AM 

For the  second time   in recent months,     U.K. judges have  warned  the Serious Fraud Office not to make plea  deals in overseas  bribery  cases, throwing into doubt the agency's whistleblower program  and its partnership with the U.S. Justice Department in resolving global  corruption cases. 
This week a U.K. appeals court  affirmed the suspended sentence agreed  between  the SFO and a former sales executive who helped bribe Greek doctors and  then turned whistleblower. But at the same time, the  court said    the SFO's U.S.-style approach was unconstitutional.
Robert John Dougall, 45, formerly marketing  director of DePuy, pleaded guilty in April to making £4.5 million in corrupt payments to    Greek medical  professionals within the  state-controlled healthcare    system. DePuy,    acquired by Johnson  & Johnson in 1999, makes and sells   orthopedic  devices. 
The SFO said Dougall was the   first  "co-operating defendant" in a major SFO corruption investigation. It  had recommended leniency in exchange for his guilty plea and help in the case, as typically happens in U.S. white-collar prosecutions. The SFO asked for  a suspended sentence; the trial court instead sent Dougall  to prison for a year. 
The appeals court reversed the sentence but hammered the SFO. It  said "agreements between the prosecution and the defense about the sentences  to be imposed in fraud and corruption cases were constitutionally  forbidden" and solely under the purview of judges, according to reports.
In March, Britain's second-ranking criminal judge said  the $12.7  million fine the SFO agreed with a U.K. division of  Innospec Inc. went beyond   the SFO's authority. Delaware-based Innospec had reached what it believed was a $40 million global   settlement with U.S. prosecutors  and the SFO.
 At Innospec's hearing, Lord Justice Thomas,  the deputy  head  of criminal justice in the U.K. courts, said: “I have  concluded that the director of  the SFO had  no power to enter into the arrangements made and no such   arrangements  should be made again.” Although he   confirmed the U.K.  part of the fine agreed by the SFO,  he called the amount  "wholly  inadequate." See our post here.
The SFO first charged Dougall in November 2009 after a "referral" from the U.S. Justice Department. Two  months earlier, DePuy and four other orthopedic  device  makers -- Biomet, Zimmer,   Smith & Nephew  and Stryker -- had agreed to pay $310  million to settle    charges they paid kickbacks to induce U.S. doctors  to buy their    products. Since the U.S. settlement, the four companies,  along with   Medtronic Inc.  and Wright Medical Group, have disclosed DOJ and SEC    Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act investigations. See our post here.

DePuy Exec Jailed

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Friday, April 16, 2010 at 6:18AM 

The U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office said this week that a former DePuy executive pleaded guilty to making  £4.5 million in corrupt payments to Greek medical professionals within the  state-controlled healthcare system. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison.
Robert John Dougall, 45, was DePuy's marketing director. The company, acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 1999, makes and sells  orthodpedic devices. The SFO said from  2002 to 2005, Dougall arranged the payment of commissions to surgeons as an inducement to use DePuy's products. The payments were made through agents and offshore accounts.
The SFO said its investigation began "following a referral by the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2007."  Dougall, it said, is the first "co-operating defendant" in a major SFO corruption investigation, which is ongoing.
Dougall was first charged by the SFO in November 2009. In September 2007, DePuy and four other orthopedic device makers -- Biomet, Zimmer, Smith & Nephew and Stryker -- agreed to pay $310 million to settle charges they paid kickbacks to induce U.S. doctors to buy their products. Since the U.S. settlement, the four companies, along with Medtronic Inc. and Wright Medical Group, have disclosed DOJ and SEC Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations. See our post here.
A copy of the SFO's April 14, 2010 release can be viewed here.

TuesdayDec012009


Ex-Johnson & Johnson Exec Charged In U.K.

By   Richard L. Cassin |   Tuesday, December 1, 2009 at 7:07PM 

Britain's Serious Fraud Office charged a former executive of a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary with overseas corruption. Robert John Dougall, 44, an ex-vice president of DePuy International Limited of Leeds, appeared Tuesday in the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court. He's accused of making corrupt payments to medical professionals in the Greek public healthcare system in order to sell orthopaedic products. The conduct allegedly occurred between February 2002 and December 2005.
The summons charged Dougall with conspiracy to corrupt in violation of the Criminal Law Act 1977. He was released on unconditional bail. A copy of the SFO's December 1 announcement is here.
The SFO said it began working on the case in March 2008. In February 2007, Johnson & Johnson said it had "voluntarily disclosed to the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that subsidiaries outside the United States are believed to have made improper payments in connection with the sale of medical devices in two small-market countries. " The company said then that Michael J. Dormer, the officer responsible for the overseas medical device business, had accepted responsibility and retired. In September 2007, DePuy and four other orthopedic device makers -- Biomet, Zimmer, Smith & Nephew and Stryker -- agreed to pay $310 million to settle charges they paid kickbacks to induce U.S. doctors to buy their products. Since the U.S. settlement, the four companies, along with Medtronic Inc. and Wright Medical Group, have disclosed DOJ and SEC Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations. 
The Serious Fraud Office -- which has a new-look website and says it now has 88 ongoing cases -- didn't say if DePuy or others will also face charges.
