EisnerAmper Wealth Management and Corporate Benefits 

For high net worth individuals whose financial assets largely consist of the businesses they own, the path to liquidity is a complex one that requires planning and expert navigation. The business transitions that can unlock their wealth have both opportunity and risk attached to them and are typically influenced by very personal, highly individual objectives and concerns. EisnerAmper Wealth Management & Corporate Benefits LLC (“WMCB”) exists to provide business owners with the advanced financial planning they need to prepare for transitions, to maximize their return on investments, and to enjoy fully the rewards they’ve earned through years of effort.
The EisnerAmper WMCB multi-disciplinary team provides individual clients with a full range of financial planning solutions that integrate investment management, estate planning, asset protection and tax efficiency. Our clients are typically the owners of private or closely-held businesses. The catalysts for engaging us include a desire to coordinate effective planning strategies between personal and corporate goals; including personal financial and wealth management, planning for business transition, or corporate retirement plan strategies as well as maximizing corporate benefit programs.  In addition to working with successful business owners, EisnerAmper Wealth Management has a specialized division: “Women in Transition”. We work with the accountants, attorneys, and bankers who serve in this unique field. Notably, we offer a specialized set of resources to educate and empower clients of our ‘Women in Transition’ practice – including successful female business owners, widows and divorcées. Our multi- faceted team of consultants is comprised of Certified Financial Planners, Certified Business Exit Consultants, registered investment advisors, licensed insurance advisors, and benefit-plan specialists. All of these consultants perform a detailed discovery to reveal what a client’s goals are and to create strategies to achieve them. Goals range from business succession and tax efficient estate transfer to Corporate Benefits including medical insurance and retirement plans. Personal investments and risk management are honed for optimal performance based on individual risks and time horizons. Clients turn to us for assessment, planning blueprints and implementation roadmaps, all customized to their particular objectives and tailored to their target time horizons. When the initial assessment has been shared with the client, our independent process helps determine the strategy which best serves their goals. We have the added value to turn to the specialized skills of our EisnerAmper LLP peers, including their Private Business Services and Tax practices group, when needed.
A key differentiator for WMCB clients is our ability not only to conduct thorough independent financial planning but also to implement that plan. This gives clients the critical information they need to align today’s decision-making with tomorrow’s needs. We keep clients well informed of relevant tax, investment, retirement and employee benefit developments through ongoing participation in industry associations such as the National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices, the National Affiliation with Business Exit Consultants, and several other organizations focused on investing, insurance, and planning.

												Yet Another Strong Quarter, But Stay Focused Beyond The Horizon
											



  Capping a string of strong quarterly gains, stocks posted a total return of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2017. That followed a return of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, which followed a return of 3.9% in the third-quarter and a 2.5% return in the second quarter of 2016.  With dividends, the total return on the blue-chip companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index was 17.2%, for the 12 months ended in March 31.That's a strong bull run!The first quarter's gain continued the fourth quarter "Trump rally," although a steady stream of strong economic and earnings data played a strong supporting role in the advance to new record highs.Stocks over the one-year period recovered from last year's profit-collapse in the energy and mining sectors and, after the November 8th national election, enthusiasm for what the Trump presidency might mean for the economy and corporate earnings pushed prices higher still.  For the five years ended March 31, the total return on shares in large publicly-held American companies soared by 87%! Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, stocks have staged an extraordinary comeback from the near collapse of the world financial system in 2008. After trading sideways for approximately one year from mid-2015 to mid-2016 - and hitting two air pockets - the stock market broke out of that range in the second half of 2016, and gained additional momentum post-election.The likelihood of a bear market - a correction of at least 20% - increases as the bull market grows older. However, fundamental economic conditions that have accompanied bear markets in the past were not present when the first-quarter of 2017 ended. Precursors of a serious market downturn in the past - such as restrictive Fed policy, slowing economic growth, stock market overvaluation, and irrational exuberance - were not evident as the second quarter of 2017 got under way.  The Labor Department Friday said the unemployment rate in March sank to 4.5%. That's as low as it has been since the peak of the last economic expansion in 2007. The U.S. economy is at full employment.Not surprisingly, job creation in March slowed. That's to be expected, as the economy has been running at full employment for months, the labor market has tightened, and wages and benefits have accelerated steadily for months.  At the helm of the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, Chair Janet Yellen has been steering slowly and steadily toward rising interest rates. While the tide has changed and the pace of economic growth for months has risen, signals of further growth are on the horizon and seems likely barring some unforeseen obstacles.   On Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500 closed the week slightly lower but remained within about 1.5% of its all-time high.Stocks have had an amazing run. Uncertainty increased last week after the U.S. fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles to reduce Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's air power after his forces attacked their own people with deadly sarin gas. Meanwhile, no clear way to finance a much-anticipated federal tax cut has added to worries about whether stock prices are vulnerable.If the U.S. effort to prevent further attacks on innocent civilians in Syria flares into a dispute with Syria's backers in Iran or Russia, or if tax reform emerging from Washington is disappointing, a correction of 10% or 15% could come at any time.  However, economic data has been stronger than expected for many months, and consumers are in the best shape in years. Better than expected growth could propel stocks higher still. Long-term investors should not be distracted by near-term uncertainty and stay focused on what's beyond the next drop or surge.

												Wall Street's "Top" Strategists' Recommendations Are Like Monkeys Throwing Darts
											



  On December 16, 2016, Barron's ran its annual outlook story featuring forecasts from a panel of 10 "top" Wall Street investment strategists. The respected financial weekly publishes its panel's predictions for the stock market for the year ahead and for the sectors they are buying and avoiding every December.  Fritz Meyer, an independent economist, whose research we pay for, has tracked the Wall Street strategists' sector forecasts in Barron's every year since 2005. Mr. Meyer was an investment strategist at one of the world's largest investment companies for over a decade before going independent in 2009. With no products to sell except his research, Mr. Meyer's data tracking the record of recommendations made by big retail brokerages firms represents a rare in-depth look at the success of following Wall Street's investment advice.  So far in 2017, through July 14, the 10 strategists from the large Wall Street firms have been prescient relative to their long record. Financials was the most favored sector with backing from eight strategists, and health care was the next favored, being picked by five strategists. Consumer staples was by far the least favored sector for 2017. How have these picks and pans performed this year?   Here are the results from the start of 2017 through July 14. Keep in mind, however, only half of the strategists picked the highly-performing health care sector, which was the second most-favored of Wall Street's picks. Their clear favorite, financials, is underperforming the S&P 500. Energy, one of their favored sectors, is bombing. Utilities, consumer staples and real estate, which were all panned, are all showing positive returns.  While Wall Street's "top" strategists' recommendations are performing well so far in 2017, their long-term record is not nearly as good. Year after year, since 2005, the so-called top strategists' recommendations have performed poorly compared to a simple diversified portfolio, according to Meyer.  Since the inception of Barron's annual surveys of Wall Street strategists in 2005, results on the strategists' advice has been scattershot. If Wall Street's strategists' sector advice had been correct, then the yellow dots would all lie along the red line. Instead they're random. Wall Street, historically, has been unable to predict how sectors will perform. They're throwing darts, and their aim is off.  2016 was full of surprises, like the election of Donald J. Trump, and the strategists did not perform well. Energy and telecom services were not the favored sectors of the strategists, but those sectors outperformed all the others. Although the strategists favored financials and technology, and both of those did well, the materials and utilities sectors, which they panned, both beat the S&P 500.   With that in mind, we want to remind you that the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed on Friday at 2472.54, just a fraction off Wednesday's closing price of 2473.83, which set a new all-time high, and a change in sentiment or unexpected negative news could trigger a 10% or 15% plunge at any time. But the outlook for the fundamentals that drive stock prices remains bright and predicting the stock market's future is not what we do.  Meyer's analysis illustrates that the predictions of Wall Street's so-called "top" strategists' are about as reliable at sector forecasting as monkeys throwing darts. It's why we invest based on a strategic, evidenced-based discipline and are independent of the big Wall Street retail brokerages.
