I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July. Allowing five working days it should be on hand prior to the 18th.  RT                   Jul 26, 2017  Haven't yet opened product as it was bought to replace another still in use.

The quality of the toner is very good and consistent. Please work on improving the print quality towards the end of the cartridge life, after 6 months the print tends to be lighter with every print.
