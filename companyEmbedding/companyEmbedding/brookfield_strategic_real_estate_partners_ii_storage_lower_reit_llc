Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM), a Toronto-based global asset manager with large investments in commercial real estate, has agreed to acquire Simply Self Storage (SSS) for $830M. The intended purchase is for the company’s Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II fund, a vehicle for acquisitions and investment in real estate companies, distressed loans and securities, according to “IPE Real Estate,” a media outlet that covers institutional investment and the real estate industry.





 








The structure of the deal includes an initial investment in SSS of $300 million followed by another $200 million, which the self-storage operator will use to fund growth opportunities, the source reported. SSS intends to acquire individual storage facilities and small to mid-sized portfolios in secondary markets, while considering new developments in major and small markets. The self-storage company is expected to retain its current leadership.
Neither BAM nor SSS officials have commented publicly on the acquisition, although the asset manager alluded to the transaction in its interim third-quarter 2015 financial report. The company “committed or deployed” about $5 billion in various investments during the quarter. “We also agreed to acquire a North American self-storage company with 90 locations and an enterprise value of $800 million, and hope this can be a cornerstone investment for growth of a larger national business,” BAM officials said in the report.
The IPE article attributes the 90 U.S. self-storage facilities to SSS, although the operator reported a total portfolio of 175 owned and managed facilities last fall during the collection of data for the 2015 Inside Self-Storage Top-Operators List, an annual ranking of the Top 100 operators in the industry by square footage. SSS is No. 7 in the latest ranking, with a footprint of nearly 13.5 million square feet. Headquartered in Orlando, Fla., SSS operates a portfolio spanning 18 states and Puerto Rico. The company was founded in 2003 by Kurt O’Brien, who serves as president.
The deal was initially reported by the Orange County Employees Retirement System, which has been considering an investment into the Partners II fund. BAM has raised about $5 billion for the fund, with a goal of $7 billion, according to the source. The fund is targeting opportunities in Australia, Brazil, Europe and North America. The SSS acquisition is part of $2.8 billion in deals BAM has committed to the fund, the source reported.
BAM currently has $225 billion in assets under management, according to its website. It owns and operates assets with a focus on infrastructure, private equity, property and renewable energy. The company offers a range of public and private investment products and services, and is co-listed on the New York, Toronto and Euronext stock exchanges.

New York—An affiliate of Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II has committed to invest up to $400 million, on a delayed draw basis, in American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Inc., the latter announced Friday. The Brookfield entity is a real estate private equity fund managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
Bruce Wiles
As part of the transaction, Brookfield reportedly will be afforded “certain corporate governance and approval rights over certain activities” of ARC Hospitality and its operating partnership, and the REIT’s board will be overhauled.
In addition, once the transaction has closed, and under a separate agreement with ARC Hospitality’s current external manager, American Realty Capital Hospitality Advisors LLC, ARC Hospitality will become self-managed and will terminate the existing advisory agreement.
Finally, ARC Hospitality will be renamed as Hospitality Investors Trust Inc.
The closing is expected to occur in March. ARC Hospitality did not reply to Commercial Property Executive’s request for further information.
The ARC Hospitality board of directors will be increased from four members to seven. Of the seven, two members will be appointed by Brookfield; they are expected to be Bruce Wiles, who will serve as board chairman, and Lowell Baron, both of whom hold senior management positions at Brookfield.
Stanley Perla and Abby Wenzel will continue as directors, and it’s anticipated that Jonathan Mehlman, the company’s president & CEO, will be added to the board, along with two new independent directors nominated by the existing board and approved by Brookfield.
Among the uses to which the $135 million initial portion of Brookfield’s investment will be put is the acquisition for $66.8 million of a seven-hotel, 651-key portfolio, pursuant to ARC Hospitality’s pending purchase agreement with Summit Hotel Properties Inc. The Marriott International, Hilton Hotels & Resorts and InterContinental Hotels Group properties are in Germantown, Tenn.; Ridgeland, Miss.; and Jackson, Miss.
The purchase will boost the company’s lodging portfolio to 148 hotels and 17,844 keys across 33 states.
“We expect Brookfield’s investment commitment to enhance our ability to complete our property renovations on a timely basis and to close the Summit acquisition, which we believe will enhance our portfolio value,” Edward Hoganson, ARC Hospitality’s CFO, said in a prepared statement.
“In addition, by addressing our near-term financing needs, the investment should provide the Company with a more sustainable capital structure and an improved debt maturity profile. Moreover, we believe the Company’s transition to self-management will allow us to operate more cost efficiently….”

Office
We own, develop and manage 250 office properties totaling approximately 128 million square feet in key gateway cities in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil and India. This global presence makes us the landlord of choice for many multinational tenants with whom we have developed deep and long-term relationships. This gives us a competitive advantage as we are able to leverage key relationships across geographies and business lines. Our premier office portfolio includes landmark assets such as Brookfield Places in New York, Toronto and Perth, Canary Wharf in London, Potsdamer Platz in Berlin and Darling Park in Sydney.












                                    Brookfield Place New York, U.S.
                                

In 2011 we undertook a major redevelopment of the property formerly known as the World Financial Center, which we originally acquired in 1996. Renamed Brookfield Place New York, the complex has been transformed into a vibrant multipurpose destination that attracts tourists and locals alike. Once home to primarily financial services related tenants, the 8 million square foot property now has a diverse tenant base, luxury retailers and restaurants, and is fully occupied. BPNY’s transformation into a vibrant live-work-play destination has been a significant contributor to the revitalization of Lower Manhattan.

                                    In 2015 we acquired Potsdamer Platz, an iconic mixed-use complex in the center of historic Berlin. At acquisition, occupancy had fallen to 79%, creating an opportunity to leverage our global tenant relationships and asset management capabilities. We are investing €100 million to renovate and reposition the 3 million square foot estate as an attractive location for office, retail and residential tenants.

                                    China Xintiandi (CXTD) is a 4 million square foot, mixed-use complex in Shanghai’s central business district and Hongqiao transportation hub. CXTD’s owner partnered with us in 2014 to complete development of several properties within the complex and leverage our expertise in leasing the buildings. Two towers were sold in 2015 and 2016, earning returns that exceeded expectations.

                                    In 2014 we acquired India Office Parks, a 10-million-square-foot, Class A office portfolio within India’s Special Economic Zones ("SEZ"), as well as a partially constructed, 6 million square foot development portfolio. We restarted construction and leveraged our global tenant relationships to lease the buildings. As India’s office market matures, we see opportunities to expand the platform.

In 2005 we completed a $2 billion privatization of two of Olympia & York’s publicly traded entities, acquiring 11 million square feet of office properties to form our Canadian Office Fund. The acquisition increased our penetration in core markets and allowed us to enter other attractive cities. We have sold non-core assets and renovated core properties, subsequently leasing 9 million square feet and increasing rents.

                                    Manhattan West is a 7 million square foot, mixed-use development at the gateway of the Hudson Yards District, one of New York’s largest development projects. We began acquiring adjacent properties for Manhattan West over 20 years ago and now have five acres covering two city blocks. Manhattan West will include three office towers, 844 apartments and 200,000 square feet of retail space, and will serve as a vibrant extension of the Midtown business district.

                                    In 2006 we led the $9 billion privatization of Trizec Properties, a NYSE-traded office REIT with assets in major U.S. cities. We believed that Trizec traded at a discount to the underlying value of its investments and that many of its properties were undermanaged. We sold non-core properties and leveraged our operating expertise and tenant relationships to drive income growth amid the global financial crisis.
                                    
                                











Multifamily

We are one of the largest owners and managers of residential apartment properties in the United States with a portfolio of approximately 30,000 rental units in high growth markets throughout the country. Through our operating affiliate, Fairfield Residential, we offer a fully integrated national multifamily services platform providing development, construction, renovation, asset and property management, and acquisition and disposition services. In addition, we have an active development pipeline with over 14,000 units of development potential in New York and London.

                                    In 2012 we acquired Gingko and Palmetto, two multifamily portfolios in the southeastern U.S. containing a combined 35 apartment communities and 8,900 units. We undertook an intensive renovation program and refinanced the properties on more favorable terms. Following completion of the capital improvement program, many of the properties have been sold at substantially higher valuations. 









                                    Manhattan Multifamily, U.S.
                                

In 2014 we acquired a 4,000-unit portfolio in New York City located near strong urban growth catalysts such as Columbia University’s Manhattanville campus, the Second Avenue subway expansion and Cornell University’s tech campus in Roosevelt Island. Our capital projects – including extensive renovations, technology upgrades, and a modernization of the energy systems – have driven rental growth and lowered costs.











Retail

Our retail portfolio includes high-quality retail shopping centers located in the U.S., Europe, Brazil and Asia. Through our fully diluted 34% ownership of GGP, the second largest mall owner in the U.S., we hold an interest in 127 premier retail assets in the U.S. (approximately 125 million square feet), including Ala Moana Center (Honolulu), Tysons Galleria (Washington D.C.), Glendale Galleria (Los Angeles) and Water Tower Place (Chicago). We also own urban mixed use retail districts in New York, Shanghai, London and Berlin. Our malls are more than just places to shop; they serve as entertainment hot spots, offering movie theaters, restaurants, ice skating rinks and numerous family activities.

                                    In 2008 we led the restructuring and recapitalization of GGP, guiding the company through its emergence from the largest bankruptcy in North American real estate history and serving as the cornerstone investor in its $30 billion restructuring. We continue to hold a significant interest in what is the second largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S., with 128 properties across 125 million square feet.

In 2012 as part of the restructuring of General Growth Properties (GGP), its non-core primarily class B retail malls were spun off to form Rouse Properties, a NYSE-traded REIT. In 2016 we privatized Rouse to take advantage of a discount in its trading price vs the underlying value of its assets. We plan to unlock value in Rouse’s 35-asset portfolio through redevelopments and strategic leasing.

Industrial
Our industrial portfolio comprises approximately 45 million square feet of high quality, well-located logistics properties in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we are one of the largest industrial developers in the U.S. with a substantial development pipeline that gives us the potential to expand our existing distribution facilities, as well as develop new ones. Our commitment to developing high-quality, low energy consumption buildings, along with our expansive network of logistical warehouses has allowed us to build a global tenant base secured through long term lease structures.









                        IDI  Gazeley, U.S. / U.K.
                    

                        We built IDI Gazeley by combining three industrial real estate companies to create a leading owner, developer and operator of logistics warehouses and distribution facilities. With 60 million square feet of warehouse space, IDI Gazeley serves industrial and manufacturing firms globally and continues to grow its tenant relationships by developing build-to-suit logistics facilities.

Hospitality
We own and manage full-service hotels and leisure-style hospitality assets in high-barrier-to-entry markets across North America and the U.K. We seek to acquire these assets at a significant discount to replacement cost and actively manage them, undertaking extensive capital improvements to turn around operational performance and drive cash-flow growth.












                                    Center Parcs, U.K.
                                

                                    In 2015 we acquired Center Parcs, an operator of five short-break holiday destinations in the U.K. It generates stable, predictable cash flows, and its business model is protected due to the scarcity of available sites and the large capital investment required to develop and operate them. Since acquisition, we have upgraded revenue management and technology systems, added lodges, and expanded into Ireland.

                                    The Diplomat Beach Resort, U.S.
                                

                                    In 2014 we acquired The Diplomat Beach Resort Hollywood, Florida, located between Miami and Fort Lauderdale–one of the few beachfront hotels in the area with extensive conference facilities and land parcels available for development. We acquired the property from a distressed seller and have since begun both a full renovation and development of the land parcels. 









                                    Atlantis Paradise Island, Bahamas
                                

In 2006 we acquired an interest in the mortgage underlying the Atlantis, a 3,000-room beachfront resort with a convention center, casino, golf course, waterpark, and 65 acres of developable land. In 2011 we foreclosed on the property and took over full ownership, subsequently stabilizing its capital structure by refinancing its debt facilities. We also renovated the casino, guestrooms, and food and beverage offerings.

Other
We own and operate real estate assets across various other segments, including a student housing portfolio in the U.K. with over 6,800 rooms; a U.S. portfolio of 135 manufactured housing communities; more than 300 properties across North America leased to automotive dealerships under triple net lease arrangements; and more than 180 U.S. self-storage properties. When investing in these segments, we adhere to the strategy used across our real estate portfolio, seeking to acquire high-quality assets and drive value by focusing on fundamentals such as leasing, financing, development, construction and facilities management. 












                                    Simply Self Storage, U.S.
                                

In 2016 we acquired Simply Self Storage, an owner and operator of self-storage assets throughout the U.S., at a discount to other recent transactions in the sector. Taking advantage of the fragmented nature of the self-storage market and low supply levels, we are growing the platform by expanding the geographic mix of the portfolio and developing new storage facilities.

                                    Student Housing, U.K.
                                

In 2016 we acquired a portfolio of U.K. student housing properties and its management platform. The portfolio operates at or near full occupancy and is located near top-ranked universities with large student populations. In the U.K., universities are able to provide housing to only a fraction of their students. To take advantage of this demand, we are growing the portfolio through development and acquisition of smaller portfolios.

Now renamed Hospitality Investors Trust Inc., the former American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Inc. has closed the $135 million initial funding of a $400 million convertible preferred commitment from an affiliate of Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners II, a CRE private equity fund managed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., HIT announced late last week.
Bruce Wiles
In addition, HIT has completed a transition to self-management, having terminated its previous external management agreement with American Realty Capital Hospitality Advisors LLC. Former employees of the advisor and its affiliates who had been involved in the day-to-day management of the company’s hotel assets, including all of the advisor’s executive officers, have become employees of HIT.
First reported by Commercial Property Executive in mid-January, the deal calls for Brookfield to fund $135 million as part of a total investment commitment of up to $400 million in the form of convertible preferred limited partnership units of HIT’s operating partnership, renamed Hospitality Investors Trust Operating Partnership L.P. The remaining $265 million of convertible preferred units will be issued on a delayed-draw basis through February 2019.
The newest news about this transaction relates to changes to the HIT board, which has been expanded from four members to seven. Of these seven, two have been appointed by Brookfield: Bruce Wiles, chairman of the board, and Lowell Baron, both of whom hold senior management positions at Brookfield.
Jonathan Mehlman, HIT’s long-time president & CEO, has been elected to the board of directors for the first time, and Stanley Perla and Abby Wenzel are continuing as independent directors. (William Kahane and Robert Burns have resigned from the board).
The two new independent directors, elected to the board following approval by Brookfield, are Edward Glickman and Stephen Joyce.
Glickman is the executive chairman of FG Asset Management, Korea’s first global real estate asset manager, according to information provided to Commercial Property Executive by an HIT spokesperson. He was formerly president & CEO of Pennsylvania REIT, one of the first publicly traded REITs, which owns and operates more than 25 million square feet of retail focusing on shopping centers in the eastern United States.
Joyce is CEO of Choice Hotels International Inc., one of the world’s largest hotel franchisors, with brands including Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality Inn, Sleep Inn, Clarion, Cambria Hotel & Suites, Mainstay Suites, Suburban Extended Stay, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn and Ascend Hotel Collection. His career in the lodging industry has spanned more than three decades.
Net proceeds from the $135 million initial issuance will be used in part for the acquisition of a seven-hotel, 651-key portfolio from Summit Hotel Properties Inc. for $66.8 million. These hotels are branded Marriott International, Hilton Hotels & Resorts or InterContinental Hotels Group and are in Germantown, Tenn.; Ridgeland, Miss.; and Jackson, Miss. The transaction will bring HIT’s lodging portfolio to 148 hotels totaling 17,844 keys across 33 states.
