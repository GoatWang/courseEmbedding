John Hancock introduces new Variable Universal Life Insurance with Vitality

BY Melissa Berczuk |  2017-07-25








BOSTON, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- John Hancock today launched a new Protection variable universal life product, Protection VUL that offers significantly lower premiums and cash value growth potential, giving consumers the opportunity for affordable life insurance coverage that can help them meet their long-term financial objectives and pursue longer, healthier lives with the John Hancock Vitality program.
For the first time, Protection VUL policyholders can earn rewards and premium savings of up to 15 percent for the everyday things they do to stay healthy with the John Hancock Vitality program. In fact, the healthier their lifestyle, the greater their rewards, including $600 in annual savings on healthy food purchases1 as well as the opportunity to earn an Apple Watch® Series 22 by exercising regularly. John Hancock is also giving every new policyholder a complimentary Fitbit® device to help them get started.
"At John Hancock, we're focused on providing consumers with innovative solutions designed to help meet a variety of financial planning needs," said Brooks Tingle, senior vice president, Marketing and Strategy, John Hancock Insurance. "By expanding the John Hancock Vitality offerings to include Protection VUL, we can help many more consumers better prepare for the future, while also supporting them as they take steps to lead longer, healthier lives," said Tingle.
Protection VUL is designed for pre-retirees, and features strong death benefit protection along with cash value accumulation potential that can offer consumers flexibility to help them meet future financial goals. Policyholders can also choose from a diversified range of underlying investment accounts that represent nearly every major asset class and investment style.
The new Protection VUL offers additional attractive features including LifeTrack, John Hancock's quick, easy and dynamic policy management solution to help clients and advisors ensure life insurance policies stay on track to meet their intended insurance goals.

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

GUIDE TO THIS PROSPECTUS
This prospectus is arranged in the following way:                               

o The first section is called "Summary of Benefits and Risks." It contains
 a summary of the benefits available under the policy and of the principal
risks of purchasing the policy. You should read this section before     
reading any other section of this prospectus.                           

 o Behind the Summary of Benefits and Risks section is a section called "Fee
Tables" that describes the fees and expenses you will pay when buying,  
owning and surrendering the policy.                                     

 o Behind the Fee Tables section is a section called "Detailed Information."
This section gives more details about the policy. It may repeat certain 
information contained in the Summary of Benefits and Risks section in   
order to put the more detailed information in proper context.           

o Finally, on the back cover of this prospectus is information concerning 
the Statement of Additional Information (the "SAI") and how the SAI,    
personalized illustrations and other information can be obtained.       

Prior to making any investment decisions, you should carefully review this      
product prospectus and all applicable supplements in conjunction with the       
prospectuses for the underlying funds that we make available as investment      
options under the policies. The funds' prospectuses describe the investment     
objectives, policies and restrictions of, and the risks relating to, investment 
in the funds. In the case of any of the portfolios that are operated as "feeder 
funds", the prospectus for the corresponding "master fund" is also provided. If 
you need to obtain additional copies of any of these documents, please contact  
your John Hancock representative or contact our Service Office at the address   
and telephone number on the back page of this product prospectus.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS 

The nature of the policy                                                        

 This prospectus describes three types of policies being offered by John
Hancock: a Variable Whole Life Policy, a Variable Whole Life P 50 Policy and a  
Variable Whole Life 100 Policy. The policies described in this prospectus are   
available only in New York. The minimum death benefit that may be bought is     
$25,000 for the Whole Life Policy, $50,000 for the Whole Life P 50 Policy and   
$100,000 for the Whole Life 100 Policy. For the Whole Life Policy and the Whole 
Life P 50 Policy, all persons insured must meet certain health and other        
criteria called "underwriting standards." All persons insured under the Whole   
Life 100 Policy must meet "preferred risk" and non-smoking underwriting         
standards. All policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of 0 and  
75. Discounts are available to insured persons meeting non-smoking underwriting 
criteria.                                                                       

The policy's primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against
economic loss due to the death of the insured person. The policy is unsuitable  
as a short-term savings vehicle because of the substantial policy-level         
charges. We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy. The     
value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease 
daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that 
you choose. The amount we pay to the policy's beneficiary insured person (we    
call this the "death benefit") may be similarly affected. That's why the policy 
is referred to as a "variable" life insurance policy. We call the investments   
you make in the policy "premiums" or "premium payments."

Summary of policy benefits

Death benefit                                                                   

In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life    
insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is called   
the "Sum Insured."                                                              

When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any 
indebtedness. The death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the   
guaranteed minimum death benefit and the Variable Sum Insured on the date of    
death of the insured person. The Variable Sum Insured is an amount equal to the 
Initial Sum Insured at issue and thereafter varies, as discussed under          
"Variable Sum Insured".                                                         

Surrender of the policy                                                         

  You may surrender the policy in full at any time. If you do, we will pay
you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any        
dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied, and the cash value of any insurance 
purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the           
difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond  
the date of surrender, less any indebtedness. This is called your "surrender    
value." You must return your policy when you request a surrender.               

If you have not taken a loan on your policy, the "cash value" of your 
policy (assuming you take all dividend payments in cash) will, on any given     
date, be equal to:                                                              

o the amount you invested,                                            

    o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options you've
chosen, and                                                               

o minus all charges we deduct.                                        

If you take a loan on your policy, your cash value will be computed   
somewhat differently. This is discussed under "Policy Loans."

Policy loans                                                                    

    You may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by
completing the appropriate form. The minimum amount of each loan is $100. The   
maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula. Interest is charged   
on each loan. You can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the        
outstanding loan balance. You can repay all or part of a loan at any time. If   
there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies, it will be deducted  
from the death benefit. Policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your 
cash value, and may also result in adverse tax consequences.

Optional benefit riders                                                         

    When you apply for the policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we make available. There are a number of such riders. Charges for   
most riders will be deducted monthly from the policy's account value.           

Investment options                                                              

  The policy offers a number of investment options, as listed on the cover
of this prospectus. They cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and        
strategies. Although the funds of the Series Funds that underlie those          
investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds, there are         
important differences between your investment options and publicly-traded       
mutual funds. On the plus side, you can transfer money from one investment      
option to another without tax liability. Moreover, any dividends and capital    
gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and      
reflected in the fund's value and create no taxable event for you. On the       
negative side, if and when policy earnings are distributed (generally as a      
result of a surrender or partial withdrawal), they will be treated as ordinary  
income instead of as capital gains. Also, you must keep in mind that you are    
purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy   
level as well as at the fund level. Such policy level charges are significant   
and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options.          

Summary of policy risks

Lapse risk                                                                      

    If you don't pay a premium when due, you will have a 31 day "grace period"
to make that payment. If you don't pay the premium by the end of the grace      
period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). All coverage under the policy 
will then cease. Even if the policy terminates in this way, you can still       
reactivate (i.e., "reinstate") it within 3 years from the beginning of the      
grace period, unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted,  
or the period of any extended term coverage (discussed below) has expired. To   
reinstate the policy, you must make the required premium payments and           
satisfying certain other conditions.                                            

    Since withdrawals reduce your account value, withdrawals increase the risk
of lapse. Loans also increase the risk of lapse.                                

Investment risk                                                                 

   As mentioned above, the investment performance of any variable investment
option may be good or bad. Your account value will rise or fall based on the    
investment performance of the variable investment options you've chosen. Some   
variable investment options are riskier than others. These risks (and potential 
rewards) are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the Series     
Funds.                                                                          

Transfer risk                                                                   

  There is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value
from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency   
of transfers you can make. The limitations on transfers out of the fixed        
account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of          
investment accounts.                                                            

Market timing risk                                                              

  Variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a
prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their   
variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable 
investment options without immediate tax consequences. As a result, some        
investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment   
options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing            
inefficiency. Whatever the reason, long-term investors in a variable investment 
option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may      
expose the investment option's underlying fund to increased portfolio           
transaction costs and/or disrupt the fund manager's ability to effectively      
manage the fund's investment portfolio in accordance with the fund's investment 
objectives and policies, both of which may result in dilution with respect to   
interests held for long-term investment.                                        

    To discourage disruptive frequent trading activity, we impose restrictions
on transfers (see "Transfers of existing account value") and reserve the right  
to change, suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges  
(see "How you communicate with us"). In addition, we reserve the right to take  
other actions at any time to restrict trading, including, but not limited to:   
(i) restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period, (ii)      
restricting the dollar amount of transfers,

and (iii) restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts. We 
also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to         
purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund.                               

While we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading     
activity, it may not always be possible to do so. Therefore, no assurance can   
be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all   
disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to long-term investors.           

Tax risks                                                                       

 In order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance
under the Internal Revenue Code, your policy must comply with certain           
requirements of the Code. We will monitor your policy for compliance with these 
requirements, but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of  
our monitoring. If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on    
the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all   
subsequent periods. The tax laws also contain a so-called "7 pay limit" that    
limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policy's death 
benefit. If the limit is violated, the policy will be treated as a "modified    
endowment contract", which can have adverse tax consequences. There are also    
certain Treasury Department rules referred to as the "investor control rules"   
that determine whether you would be treated as the "owner" of the assets        
underlying your policy. If that were determined to be the case, you would be    
taxed on any income or gains those assets generate. In other words, you would   
lose the value of the so-called "inside build-up" that is a major benefit of    
life insurance.                                                                 

    There is also a tax risk associated with policy loans. Although no part of
a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made, surrender or lapse of 
the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time 
of lapse or surrender. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under      
certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an       
insured person of advanced age, you might find yourself having to choose        
between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a        
significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur.                         

    Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws can vary greatly   
depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. There can also   
be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy          
ownership or assignment of ownership interests. For these and all the other     
reasons mentioned above, we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser  
before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy.

FEE TABLES
This section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and   
expenses that you will pay when buying, owning and surrendering the policy. In  
the first three tables, only one entry shows the minimum charge, the maximum    
charge and the charge for a representative insured person. Other entries show   
only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such. The remaining    
entries are always calculated in the same way, so we cannot assess a charge     
that is greater than the charge shown in the table. Except where necessary to   
show a rate greater than zero, all rates shown in the tables have been rounded  
to two decimal places as required by prospectus disclosure rules. Consequently, 
the actual rates charged may be slightly higher or lower than those shown.      

    The first table below describes the fees and expenses that you will pay at
the time that you pay a premium.

(1) The risk charge varies by the issue age of the insured person. The charge   
shown is for a policy issued to cover a 75 year old. This charge is     
imbedded in the base premium.                                           

(2) This charge varies by the issue age of the insured person and the length of 
time the policy has been in effect. The charge shown is for a policy    
issued to cover a 75 year old that is in its eighth policy year. This   
charge is imbedded in the base premium.

The next two tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay  
periodically during the time you own the policy. These tables do not include    
fees and expenses paid at the fund level. Except for the policy loan interest   
rate, the charges shown in the first table are deducted from your policy        
assets. The second table is devoted only to optional rider benefits. The        
charges shown in the rider table are, in fact, premiums that must be paid with  
premiums for the base policy.

(1) The insurance charge is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance   
for which we are at risk (the amount at risk or "AAR") by the applicable
  cost of insurance rate. The rates vary widely depending upon the length of
 time the policy has been in effect, the insurance risk characteristics of
the insured person and (generally) the gender of the insured person. The
  "minimum" rate shown in the table is the rate in the first policy year for
a policy issued to cover a 10 year old female preferred non-tobacco     
underwriting risk. The "maximum" rate shown in the table is the rate in 
the first policy year for a policy issued to cover a 99 year old male   
 substandard tobacco underwriting risk. This includes the so-called "extra
 mortality charge." The "representative insured person" referred to in the
table is a 45 year old male preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk. The
charges shown in the table may not be particularly relevant to your     
current situation. For more information about cost of insurance rates,  
talk to your John Hancock representative.                               

(2) The effective annual rate equivalents of the actual unrounded daily rates   
charged are .50% and .50%, respectively.                                        

(3) 8.0% is the effective annual interest rate charged in states where the      
fixed loan interest rate is applicable. In all other states, the loan   
interest rate is variable and will not be less than 5.50%. The amount of
any loan is transferred from the investment options to a special loan   
 account which earns interest at an effective annual rate that is not more
 than 2.0% less than the loan interest rate then being charged. Therefore,
the true cost of a loan is the difference between the loan interest we  
charge and the interest we credit to the special loan account.

    The next table describes the fees and expenses for each class of shares of
each portfolio underlying a variable investment option offered through this     
prospectus. None of the portfolios charge a sales load or surrender fee.The     
fees and expenses do not reflect the fees and expenses of any variable          
insurance contract or qualified plan which may use theportfolio as its          
underlying investment medium. All of the portfolios shown in the table are NAV  
class shares that are not subject to Rule 12b-1 fees. The expense ratios shown  
in the table for the NAV class shares of a portfolio are estimates for the      
current fiscal year. In those cases where a portfolio had a Series I class of   
shares in operation during 2005, the NAV class estimates are based upon the     
expense ratios of the portfolio's Series I shares for the year ended            
December 31, 2005 (adjusted to reflect the absence of a Rule 12b-1 fee          
applicable to the NAV shares).

IThe adviser for this fund has agreed, pursuant to its agreement with the John  
Hancock Trust, to waive its management fee (or, if necessary, reimburse         
expenses of the fund) to the extent necessary to limit the fund`s "Annual       
Operating Expenses". A fund's "Annual Operating Expenses" includes all of its   
operating expenses including advisory fees and Rule 12b-1 fees, but excludes    
taxes, brokerage commissions, interest, litigation and indemnification expenses 
and extraordinary expenses of the fund not incurred in the ordinary course of   
the fund`s business. Under the agreement, the adviser's obligation will remain  
in effect until May 1, 2007 and will terminate after that date only if the John 
Hancock Trust, without the prior written consent of the adviser, sells shares   
of the fund to (or has shares of the fund held by) any person other than the    
variable life insurance or variable annuity insurance separate accounts of John 
Hancock Life Insurance Company or any of its affiliates that are specified in   
the agreement. If this fee waiver had been reflected, the management fee shown  
for the, International Equity Index Trust B and Money Market Trust B would      
be 0.22% and 0.22%, respectively, and the Total Fund Annual Expenses shown would
be 0.25% and 0.25%, respectively.

DETAILED INFORMATION
 This section of the prospectus provides additional detailed information
that is not contained in the Summary of Benefits and Risks section.             

Table of Investment Options and Investment Subadvisers                          

    When you select a Separate Account investment option, we invest your money
in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the John Hancock Trust (the "Trust")  
and hold the shares in a sub-account of the Separate Account. The Fee Tables    
show the investment management fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other operating        
expenses for these portfolio shares as a percentage (rounded to two decimal     
places) of each portfolio's average net assets for 2005, except as indicated in 
the footnotes appearing at the end of the table. Fees and expenses of the       
portfolios are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policies and may   
vary from year to year. These fees and expenses differ for each portfolio and   
reduce the investment return of each portfolio. Therefore, they also indirectly 
reduce the return you will earn on any Separate Account investment options you  
select.                                                                         

   The John Hancock Trust is a so-called "series" type mutual funds and each
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") as an       
open-end management investment company. John Hancock Investment Management      
Services, LLC ("JHIMS LLC") provides investment advisory services to the Trust  
and receives investment management fees for doing so. JHIMS pays a portion of   
its investment management fees to other firms that manage the Trust's           
portfolios. We and our affiliate own JHIMS LLC and indirectly benefit from any  
investment management fees JHIMS LLC retains.                                   

  The portfolios pay us or certain of our affiliates compensation for some
of the distribution, administrative, shareholder support, marketing and other   
services we or our affiliates provide to the portfolios. The amount of this     
compensation is based on a percentage of the assets of the portfolios           
attributable to the variable insurance products that we and our affiliates      
issue. These percentages may differ from portfolio to portfolio and among       
classes of shares within a portfolio. In some cases, the compensation is        
derived from the Rule 12b-1 fees that are deducted from a portfolio's assets    
for the services we or our affiliates provide to that portfolio. In addition,   
compensation payments of up to 0.45% of assets may be made by a portfolio's     
investment advisers or its affiliates.                                          

   The following table provides a general description of the portfolios that
underlie the variable investment options we make available under the policy.    
You bear the investment risk of any portfolio you choose as an investment       
option for your policy. You can find a full description of each portfolio,      
including the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of, and the      
risks relating to investment in the portfolio in the prospectus for that        
portfolio. You should read the portfolio's prospectus carefully before          
investing in the corresponding variable investment option.                      

The investment options in the Separate Account are not publicly traded
mutual funds. The investment options are only available to you as investment    
options in the policies, or in some cases through other variable annuity        
contracts or variable life insurance policies issued by us or by other life     
insurance companies. In some cases, the investment options also may be          
available through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement      
plans. The portfolios' investment advisers and managers (i.e. subadvisers) may  
manage publicly traded mutual funds with similar names and investment           
objectives. However, the portfolios are not directly related to any publicly    
traded mutual fund. You should not compare the performance of any investment    
option described in this prospectus with the performance of a publicly traded   
mutual fund. The performance of any publicly traded mutual fund could differ    
substantially from that of any of the investment options of our Separate        
Account.                                                                        

The portfolios available under the policies are as follows:

Description of John Hancock                                                     

We are John Hancock Life Insurance Company, a Massachusetts stock life
insurance company. On February 1, 2000, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance      
Company (which was chartered in Massachusetts in 1862) converted to a stock     
company by "demutualizing" and changed its name to John Hancock Life Insurance  
Company. As part of the demutualization process, John Hancock Life Insurance    
Company became a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a newly   
formed publicly-traded corporation. In April 2004, John Hancock Financial       
Services, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation,  
a publicly-traded corporation organized under the laws of Canada. The merger    
was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September
28, 2003. As a consequence of the merger, John Hancock's ultimate parent is now 
Manulife Financial Corporation. Our Home Office is at John Hancock Place,       
Boston, Massachusetts 02117. We are authorized to transact a life insurance and 
annuity business in all states and in the District of Columbia. As of December
31, 2005, our assets were approximately $99.3 billion.                          

We are regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of  
Insurance, who periodically examines our affairs. We also are subject to the    
applicable insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which we are  
authorized to do business. We are required to submit annual statements of our   
operations, including financial statements, to the insurance

of determining solvency and compliance with local insurance laws and            
regulations. The regulation to which we are subject, however, does not provide  
a guarantee as to such matters.

Description of John Hancock Variable Life Account UV                            

    The variable investment options shown on page 1 are in fact subaccounts of
John Hancock Variable Life Account UV (the "Account"), a separate account       
established by us under Massachusetts law. The Account meets the definition of  
"separate account" under the federal securities laws and is registered as a     
unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Such registration does not involve    
supervision by the SEC of the management of the Account or of us.               

  The Account's assets are our property. Each policy provides that amounts
we hold in the Account pursuant to the policies cannot be reached by any other  
persons who may have claims against us and can't be used to pay any             
indebtedness of John Hancock other than those arising out of policies that use  
the Account. Income, gains and losses credited to, or charged against, the      
Account reflect the Account's own investment experience and not the investment  
experience of John Hancock's other assets.                                      

    New subaccounts may be added and made available to policy owners from time
to time. Existing subaccounts may be modified or deleted at any time.           

Premiums

Premium payments                                                                

We call the investments you make in the policy "premiums" or "premium 
payments."

Ways to pay premiums                                                            

   If you pay premiums by check or money order, they must be drawn on a U.S.
bank in U.S. dollars and made payable to "John Hancock Life ." We will not      
accept credit card checks. We will not accept starter or third party checks if  
they fail to satisfy our administrative requirements. Premiums after the first  
must be sent to the John Hancock Servicing Office at the appropriate address    
shown on the back cover of this prospectus.                                     

We will also accept premiums:                                         

o by wire or by exchange from another insurance company,              

o via an electronic funds transfer program (any owner interested in making
monthly premium payments must use this method), or                      

  o if we agree to it, through a salary deduction plan with your employer.

 You can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by
contacting your John Hancock representative or by contacting the John Hancock   
Servicing Office.

Payment period and frequency.                                                   

    Premiums are payable annually or more frequently over the insured person's
lifetime in accordance with our published rules and rates. Premiums are payable 
on or before the due date specified in the policy. A refund or charge will be   
made to effect premium payment to the end of the policy month in which the      
insured person dies.                                                            

Processing premium payments                                                     

 We will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it, unless
one of the following exceptions applies:                                        

  (1) We will process a payment received prior to a policy's date of issue
as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue.     

 (2) If the Minimum Initial Premium is not received prior to the date of
issue, we will process each premium payment received thereafter as if received  
on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the    
Minimum Initial Premium is received.                                            

(3) We will process the portion of any premium payment for which we   
require evidence of the insured person's continued insurability only after we   
have received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us.                    

    (4) If we receive any premium payment that we think will cause a policy to
become a modified endowment contract or will cause a policy to lose its status  
as life insurance under the tax laws, we will not accept the excess portion of  
that premium payment and will immediately notify the owner. We will refund the  
excess premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking 
system (but in no case more than two weeks after receipt), except in the        
following circumstances:                                                        

 o The tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be
made; or                                                                

o The tax problem relates to modified endowment contract status and we    
receive a signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date 
instructing us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues    
involved.                                                               

In the above cases, we will treat the excess premium as having been received on 
the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed      
acknowledgment. We will then process it accordingly.                            

(5) If a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be  
processed (as specified above) on a date that is not a business day, the        
premium payment will be processed on the business day next following that date. 

Lapse and reinstatement                                                         

    If you don't pay a premium when due, you will have a 31 day "grace period"
to make that payment. If you don't pay the premium by the end of the grace      
period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). All coverage under the policy 
will then cease. Even if the policy terminates in this way, you can still       
reactivate (i.e., "reinstate") it within 3 years from the beginning of the      
grace period, unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted,  
or the period of any extended term coverage (discussed below) has expired. You  
will have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our           
requirements for issuing coverage. You will also have to pay a prescribed       
amount of premium and be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable   
to reinstatements, as specified in the policy. If the insured person dies       
during the grace period, we will deduct any unpaid premium from the death       
benefit, prorated to the end of the month of the insured person's death.        

 Prior to the end of the business day immediately preceding the 70th day
after the beginning of the grace period, any policy values available (as        
determined in accordance with the policy) may be applied as of the beginning of 
the grace period under one of the following options for continued insurance not 
requiring further payment of premiums. These options provide for Variable or    
Fixed Paid-Up Insurance or Fixed Extended Term Insurance on the life of the     
insured person commencing at the beginning of the grace period.                 

    Both the Variable and Fixed Paid-Up Insurance options provide an amount of
paid-up whole life insurance which the available policy values will purchase.   
The amount of Variable Paid-Up Insurance may then increase or decrease in       
accordance with the investment experience of the variable investment options.   
The Fixed Paid-Up Insurance option provides a fixed and level amount of         
insurance. The Fixed Extended Term Insurance option provides a fixed amount of  
insurance determined in accordance with the policy, with the insurance coverage 
continuing for as long a period as the available policy values will purchase.

For example, using a Variable Whole Life P50 Policy (Age 25 years     
Male-Smoker) and a 6% hypothetical gross annual investment return assumption,   
if an option was elected and became effective at the end of policy year 5, the  
insurance coverage provided by the options on lapse would be as follows:        

                                                                [Download Table]

  Variable or Fixed                                                             
 Paid-Up Whole Life                        Fixed Extended Term Insurance        
--------------------                --------------------------------------------
    Death Benefit                    Death Benefit        Term in Years and Days
--------------------       or       ---------------      -----------------------
                                                                                
  $10,427                           $62,736                 12 years 331 days   

If no option has been elected before the end of the business day      
immediately preceding the 70th day after the beginning of the grace period, the 
Fixed Extended Term Insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of 
Fixed Paid-Up Insurance would equal or exceed the amount of Fixed Extended Term 
Insurance or unless the insured person is a substandard risk, in either of      
which cases Fixed Paid-Up Insurance is provided.                                

 If the insured person dies after the grace period but before the end of
the business day immediately preceding the 70th day after the beginning of the  
grace period and prior to any election, and if the policy is then in force, we  
will pay a death benefit equal to the greater of the death benefits provided    
under Fixed Extended Term Insurance (if available) or Fixed Paid-Up Insurance   
determined in accordance with the policy.                                       

   A policy continued under any option may be surrendered for its cash value
while the insured person is living. Loans may be available under the Variable   
and Fixed Paid-Up Insurance options, but not under the Fixed Extended Term      
Insurance option.                                                               

    Generally, the suicide exclusion and incontestability provision will apply
from the effective date of the reinstatement. Your policy will indicate if this 
is not the case. A surrendered policy cannot be reinstatement.                  

The death benefit                                                               

In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life    
insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is called   
the "Sum Insured."                                                              

When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any 
indebtedness. The death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the   
guaranteed minimum death benefit and the Variable Sum Insured on the date of    
death of the insured person. The Variable Sum Insured is an amount equal to the 
Initial Sum Insured at issue and thereafter varies, as discussed below.         

Guaranteed minimum death benefit                                                

  The guaranteed minimum death benefit is equal to the Initial Sum Insured
on the date of issue of the policy. We guarantee that, regardless of what your  
variable investment options earn, the death benefit will never be less than the 
guaranteed minimum death benefit.                                               

Variable sum insured                                                            

   After the first policy month, the Variable Sum Insured is determined once
each policy month on the Monthly Date. (The Monthly Date is the first day of a  
policy month which day immediately follows a business day.) The Variable Sum    
Insured remains level during the policy month following the determination.      

   Changes in the Variable Sum Insured for each policy month are computed by
a formula, filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the jurisdiction   
in which the policy has been delivered or issued for delivery. Under the        
formula the difference between the applicable Account Net Investment Rate       
(ANIR) for each business day and the policy's assumed annual rate of 41/2% is   
translated, on an actuarial basis, into a change in the Variable Sum Insured.   

  The Variable Sum Insured would increase on the next Monthly Date only if
the applicable ANIR for the last policy month were sufficiently greater than a  
monthly rate equivalent to an annual rate of 41/2% to result in such an         
increase. If the ANIR was equivalent to an annual rate of less than 41/2%, the  
Variable Sum Insured would be reduced. The percentage change in the Variable    
Sum Insured is not the same as the Account Net Investment Rate, however.

If the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods, the
amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy.      
Also, if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person, we   
will adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy.         

The account value                                                               

   From each premium payment you make, we deduct the charges described under
"Deductions from premium payments" below. We invest the rest (your so-called    
"net premium") in the investment options you've elected. We invest an amount    
equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each      
premium due date thereafter, even if we actually receive your corresponding     
premium payment before or after that date.                                      

 Over time, the amount you've invested in any variable investment option
will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount       
directly in the corresponding fund of the Series Fund and had reinvested all    
fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares; except that we will 
deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value. We         
describe these charges under "Description of Charges at the Policy Level."

Annual dividends                                                                

   These policies are participating policies which, except while in force as
Fixed Extended Term Insurance, are entitled to the share, if any, of the        
divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them. Any share  
will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary    
beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the Variable     
Whole Life 100 Policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for   
the Variable Whole Life Policy and Variable Whole Life P50 Policy.              

Dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of 
premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging 
over time after the policy's issue. Thus, participating policies generally have 
gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable non-participating     
policies. If a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable, you do    
not benefit from having a participating policy.                                 

    Both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a
refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income 
for federal or state income tax purposes.                                       

   Dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect
the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to   
factors such as interest, mortality, and expenses. State law generally          
prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results. State law     
also requires that dividends must be based on surplus, after setting aside      
certain necessary amounts, and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably  
among participating policies. In other words, in principle and by statute,      
dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue  
of a policy.                                                                    

    Each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and
compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time 
of issue. Some of the more important data studied includes mortality and        
withdrawal rates, investment yield in the general account, and actual expenses  
incurred in administering the policies. Such data is then allocated to each     
dividend class, e.g., by year of issue, age, smoking habits and plan. The       
actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each    
Policy class and make a recommendation to our Board of Directors. The Board of  
Directors, which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends, will vote   
the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class, thereby           
authorizing the distribution of each year's dividend.                           

 You may in general elect to have any dividend paid or applied under any
one of the following options: paid in cash; applied to premium payments; left   
to accumulate with interest of at least 31/2% a year; purchase fixed paid-up    
insurance; purchase one year term insurance; or purchase variable paid-up       
insurance.                                                                      

Commencement of investment performance                                          

Any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day after the    
policy's date of issue will automatically be allocated to the Money Market B    
investment option. On the later of the date such payment is received or the     
twentieth day following the date of issue, the portion of the Money Market B    
investment option attributable to such payment will be reallocated              
automatically among the investment options you have chosen.

P-->49719th Page of 31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
   All other premium payments will be allocated among the investment options
you have chosen as soon as they are processed.                                  

Allocation of future premium payments                                           

    At any time, you may change the investment options in which future premium
payments will be invested. You make the original allocation in the application  
for the policy. The percentages you select must be in whole numbers of not less 
than 10% for any option and must total 100%.                                    

Transfers of existing cash value                                                

   You may also transfer your existing cash value from one investment option
to another. To do so, you must tell us how much to transfer, either as a whole  
number percentage or as a specific dollar amount. You may not make more than    
six transfers in each policy year. A confirmation of each transfer will be sent 
to you.                                                                         

    The policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations
or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among    
investment options. As a consequence, we have reserved the right to impose      
limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of variable        
investment options. Under our current rules, we impose the following            
restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options.          
Transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional            
limitations noted below.                                                        

   Subject to the annual restriction noted above, our current practice is to
restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per        
calendar month (except with respect to those policies described in the          
following paragraph). For purposes of this restriction, and in applying the     
limitation on the number of free transfers made during the period from the      
opening of a business day (usually 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to the close of that 
business day (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) are considered one transfer. You  
may, however, transfer to the Money Market B investment option even if the two  
transfer per month limit has been reached, but only if 100% of the account      
value in all variable investment options is transferred to the Money Market B   
investment option. If such a transfer to the Money Market B investment option   
is made then, for the 30 calendar day period after such transfers, no transfers 
from the Money Market B investment option to any other investment options       
(variable or fixed) may be made. If your policy offers a dollar cost averaging  
or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program, any transfers pursuant to    
such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on      
frequent trading. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied  
uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions.                     

  Policies such as yours may be purchased by a corporation or other entity
as a means to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit 
plan, and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased  
to match its liabilities under the plan. Policies sold under these              
circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions. In lieu of the two  
transfers per month restriction (but still subject to the annual restriction    
noted above), we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to       
rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits:   
(i) during the 10 calendar day period after any account values are transferred  
from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option,   
the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they  
are transferred into the Money Market B investment option; and (ii) any account 
values that would otherwise not be transferable by application of the 10 day    
limit described above and that are transferred into the Money Market B          
investment option may not be transferred out of the Money Market B investment   
option into any other investment options (variable or fixed) for 30 calendar    
days. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to 
all policy owners subject to the restrictions.                                  

If we change any of the above rules relating to transfers, we will notify you   
of the change.                                                                  

Limitation on number of investment options                                      

Whether through the allocation of premium or through the transfer of  
existing cash value, you can never be invested in more than five investment     
options at any one time.                                                        

Surrender                                                                       

You may surrender your policy in full at any time for its "surrender  
value." You must return your policy when you request a full surrender. The      
surrender value will be the policy cash value plus any dividends and interest   
unpaid or unapplied, and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any    
dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross  
premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender, less   
any indebtedness.

Policy loans                                                                    

 You may borrow from your policy at any time after it has been in effect
for 1 year by completing a form satisfactory to us or, if the telephone         
transaction authorization form has been completed, by telephone. The maximum    
amount you can borrow is what we call your "Loan Value." The Loan Value will be 
90% of the total of the policy cash value (assuming no dividends) and any cash  
value under the variable paid-up insurance dividend option, plus any cash value 
under the fixed paid up insurance dividend option. Interest accrues and is      
compounded daily at an effective annual rate equal to the then applicable       
Variable Loan Interest Rate. However, if you elect the Fixed Loan Interest      
Rate, interest accrues and is compounded daily at an effective annual rate of   
8%.                                                                             

The amount of any outstanding loan plus accrued interest is called the
"indebtedness." Except when used to pay premiums, a loan will not be permitted  
unless it is at least $100. You may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness  
while the insured person is living and premiums are being duly paid. Any loan   
is charged against the variable investment options in proportion to the policy  
cash value allocated to the variable investment options and, upon repayment,    
the repayment is allocated to the variable investment options in proportion to  
the outstanding indebtedness in each variable investment option at such time.   

We determine the Variable Loan Interest Rate annually. The Fixed Loan 
Interest Rate is 8% for the life of the policy. At the time of issue, you can   
elect which loan interest rate will apply to any policy loan. If permitted by   
the law of the state in which the policy is issued, you may change a prior      
choice of loan interest rate. If at the time of such request there is           
outstanding indebtedness, the change will generally become effective on the     
next policy anniversary.                                                        

The Variable Loan Interest Rate determined annually for a policy will 
apply to all indebtedness outstanding during the policy year following the date 
of determination. The rate will not exceed the higher of 51/2% or the Published 
Monthly Average (as defined below) for the calendar month which is two months   
prior to the month in which the date of determination occurs. The Published     
Monthly Average means Moody`s Corporate Bond Yield Average as published by      
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or any successor thereto.                       

    The amount of the loan deducted from the investment options is placed in a
special loan account. This special loan account will earn interest at an        
effective annual rate that is not more than 2% below the interest rate we are   
then charging on the loan (assuming no taxes).                                  

Repayment of policy loans                                                       

If you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment, you must include
instructions to that effect. Otherwise, all payments will be assumed to be      
premium payments. We process loan repayments as of the day we receive the       
repayment.                                                                      

Effects of policy loans                                                         

 The cash value, the net cash surrender value, and the death benefit are
permanently affected by any loan, whether or not it is repaid in whole or in    
part. This is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment    
options and placed in a special loan account. The investment options and the    
special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return.  

  The amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount
otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable.                      

   Whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policy's cash
value (plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paid-up           
insurance), the policy will terminate 31 days after we have mailed notice of    
termination to you (and to any assignee of record at such assignee's last known 
address) specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination,  
unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period. 
Also, taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may    
lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan   
and the interest rate credited to the special loan account. Policy loans may    
also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances (see "Tax
considerations").

Description of charges at the policy level

Deductions from premium payments                                                

o Premium tax charge - A charge to cover expected state premium taxes we  
must pay, on average. This charge is 2.5% of each premium.              

o Adjustment for premium payment frequency - If you select a premium      
 payment mode other than annual (so that we receive your premiums over the
 course of the year, rather than all at the beginning), there will be less
value in your policy to support it during the course of the year. To    
 compensate for the risk to us that this creates, the rate we set for each
non- annual premium includes an additional amount that we retain, rather
than crediting it to your policy.                                       

 o Annual administrative charge - A charge of $50 in each policy year to
help defray our annual administrative expenses.                         

o Charge for extra insurance risk - The amount of premiums we may require 
may include an additional component if the insured person presents      
particular mortality risks. We retain these additional amounts to       
compensate us for that risk.                                            

 o Optional benefits charge - The amount of premiums we require is increased
  by an additional component to cover any optional rider benefits you choose
for your policy. We retain such additional amounts to compensate us for 
the obligations we assume under the rider(s).                           

o Premium sales charge - A charge not to exceed 9% of the basic annual    
premium during the period equal to the lesser of 20 years or the        
anticipated life expectancy of the insured person, based on the 1980    
  Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table. (The basic annual premium
is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits,
additional charges for extra mortality risks and the $50 annual         
  administrative charge). The charge during the first two policy years shall
not exceed 30% of the basic annual premium paid during the first policy 
  year plus 10% of the basic annual premium paid for the second policy year.
Charges of 10% or less are made for later policy year.                  

o Additional first year administrative charge - A charge in the first     
policy year at the rate of $13 per $1,000 of the Initial Sum Insured (as
  shown in the policy) for a Variable Whole Life Policy, $7 per $1,000 for a
  Variable Whole Life P50 Policy and $4 per $1,000 for a Variable Whole Life
  100 policy or a pro rata portion thereof, to cover administrative expenses
in connection with the issuance of the policy.                          

o Risk charge - A charge necessary to cover the risk we assumed that the  
Variable Sum Insured will be less than the guaranteed minimum death     
benefit. This charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages
approximately 3% of the basic annual premium.                           

o Deduction for dividends - A deduction for dividends to be paid or       
  credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date
of the policy. This deduction will vary by age of the insured person and
duration of the policy but is expected to average approximately 5-9% of 
the basic annual premium.                                               

Deductions from account assets                                                  

o Insurance charge - A monthly charge for the cost of insurance. To       
  determine the charge, we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are
  at risk by a cost of insurance rate. The rate is derived from an actuarial
table. The table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance 
 rates. The cost of insurance rates will never be more than those based on
the 1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables. Cost of      
 insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy, as
the insured person`s attained age increases. (The insured person's      
 "attained age" on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that
date).                                                                  

o M & E charge - A daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume.
 This charge is deducted from the variable investment options. The current
charge is at an effective annual rate of .50% of the value of the assets
in each variable investment option. We guarantee that this charge will  
never exceed an effective annual rate of .50%.                          

Additional information about how certain policy charges work

Sales expenses and related charges                                              

 The premium sales charges help to compensate us for the cost of selling
our policies. (See "Description of Charges at the Policy Level".) The amount of 
the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales        
expenses for that year. We expect to recover our total sales expenses over the  
life of the policy. To the extent that the sales charges do not cover total     
sales expenses, the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources,         
including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains 
with respect to the policies, or from our general assets. Similarly,            
administrative expenses not                                                     

21

P-->49722nd Page of 31TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 22nd
fully covered by the annual administrative charge and the additional first year 
administrative charge may also be recovered from such other sources.            

Method of deduction                                                             

   We deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policy's
investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each.  

Other charges we could impose in the future                                     

  We currently make no charge for our federal income taxes. However, if we
incur, or expect to incur, additional income taxes attributable to any          
subaccount of the Account or this class of policies in future years, we reserve 
the right to make a charge for such taxes. Any such charge would reduce what    
you earn on any affected investment options. However, we expect that no such    
charge will be necessary.                                                       

Under current laws, we may incur state and local taxes (in addition to
premium taxes) in several states. At present, these taxes are not significant.  
If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, we may     
make charges for such taxes.                                                    

Description of charges at the fund level                                        

The funds must pay investment management fees and other operating     
expenses. These fees and expenses (shown in the Fee Tables section) are         
different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund.          
Therefore, they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable 
investment options you select. Expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified 
under the terms of the policy, and those expenses may vary from year to year.   

Other policy benefits, rights and limitations

Optional benefit riders you can add                                             

  When you apply for a policy, you can request any of the optional benefit
riders that we then make available. Availability of any rider, the benefits it  
provides and the charges for it may vary by state. Our rules and procedures     
will govern eligibility for any rider and, in some cases, the configuration of  
the actual rider benefits. Each rider contains specific details that you should 
review before you decide to choose the rider. We may change rider premiums (or  
the rates that determine them), but not above any applicable maximum amount     
stated in the Policy Specifications page of your policy. We may add to, delete  
from or modify the following list of optional benefit riders:                   

 o Disability Benefit - Waiver of Premium Rider - This rider waives premiums
for the policy during the total disability (as defined in the rider) of 
the insured person. If total disability begins prior to age 60, premiums
 will be waived for the duration of the policy so long as total disability
  continues. If total disability begins on or after age 60, premiums will be
  waived only up to the earlier of (i) age 65 or (ii) the cessation of total
disability.                                                             

o Fixed Accidental Death Benefit Rider - This rider provides for an       
additional insurance benefit if the insured person`s death is due to    
accidental causes between the policy anniversaries nearest the insured  
person's 5th and 70th birthdays.                                        

o Children's Insurance Benefit Rider - This rider covers children of the  
insured person at the time of application and children born or adopted  
after the rider is purchased. For coverage to begin on any child, he or 
she must be more than 14 days old and less than 15 years old. Coverage  
will continue until the earliest of (i) termination of the rider upon   
request, (ii) lapse of the policy, (iii) the insured person`s 65th      
birthday, (iv) election to convert to permanent coverage on the child's 
  18th birthday, or (v) the child`s 22nd birthday. Since we don't know which
children are covered at any point in time, it is up to you to terminate 
the rider if it no longer suits your needs.                             

o Applicant's Waiver of Premium Benefit Rider - This rider waives premiums
for the policy during the total disability (as defined in the rider) of 
 the applicant for the policy. If total disability begins prior to age 60,
premiums will be waived for the duration of the policy so long as total 
disability continues. If total disability begins on or after age 60,    
premiums will be waived only up to the earlier of (i) age 65 or (ii) the
cessation of total disability.                                          

o Indeterminate Premium YRT Rider on Insured and/or Spouse - This rider   
  provides a level or decreasing amount of term insurance on the life of the
 insured person and/or the insured person's spouse. The benefit is payable
if the person

 insured under the rider dies during the term period. In applying for this
 rider, you must choose the term period and whether the coverage amount is
level or decreasing.                                                    

o Initial Term Insurance Rider - This rider provides immediate coverage on
the life of the insured person for term periods of one to eleven months 
prior to the policy's date of issue. The rider is for those who want to 
  select a date of issue that is one to eleven months subsequent to the date
of application.                                                         

Changes that we can make as to your policy                                      

    We reserve the right to make any changes in the policy necessary to ensure
the policy is within the definition of life insurance under the federal tax     
laws and is in compliance with any changes in federal or state tax laws.        

In our policies, we reserve the right to make certain changes if they 
would serve the best interests of policy owners or would be appropriate in      
carrying out the purposes of the policies. Such changes include the following:  

   o Changes necessary to comply with or obtain or continue exemptions under
the federal securities laws                                                     

o Combining or removing investment options                            

o Changes in the form of organization of any separate account         

  Any such changes will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable
laws and only in the manner permitted by such laws. When required by law, we    
will obtain your approval of the changes and the approval of any appropriate    
regulatory authority.                                                           

The owner of the policy                                                         

  Who owns the policy? That's up to the person who applies for the policy.
The owner of the policy is the person who can exercise most of the rights under 
the policy, such as the right to choose the investment options or the right to  
surrender the policy. In many cases, the person buying the policy is also the   
person who will be the owner. However, the application for a policy can name    
another person or entity (such as a trust) as owner. Wherever the term "you"    
appears in this prospectus, we've assumed that the reader is the person who has 
the right or privilege being discussed. There may be tax consequences if the    
owner and the insured person are different, so you should discuss this issue    
with your tax adviser. While the insured person is alive, you will have a       
number of options under the policy. Here are some major ones:                   

    o Determine when and how much you invest in the various investment options

o Borrow amounts you have in the investment options                   

o Change the beneficiary who will receive the death benefit           

o Turn in (i.e., "surrender") the policy for the full amount of its   
surrender value                                                           

o Reduce the amount of insurance by surrendering part of the policy   

o Choose the form in which we will pay out the death benefit or other 
proceeds                                                                        

It is possible to name so-called "joint owners" of the policy. If more
than one person owns a policy, all owners must join in most requests to         
exercise rights under the policy.                                               

Policy cancellation right                                                       

You have the right to cancel your policy within the latest of the     
following periods:                                                              

    o 10 days after you receive it (this period may be longer in some states);

    o 10 days after mailing by John Hancock of the Notice of Withdrawal Right;
or                                                                        

o 45 days after the date Part A of the application has been completed.

This is often referred to as the "free look" period. To cancel your   
policy, simply deliver or mail the policy to us at one of the addresses shown   
on the back cover, or to the John Hancock representative who delivered the      
policy to you.                                                                  

    In most states, you will receive a refund of any premiums you've paid. The
date of cancellation will be the date of such mailing or delivery.

Reports that you will receive                                                   

At least annually, we will send you a statement setting forth the     
following information as of the end of the most recent reporting period: the    
amount of the death benefit and cash value, and any outstanding policy loan     
(and interest charged for the preceding policy year). Moreover, you also will   
receive confirmations of transfers among investment options, policy loans and   
certain other policy transactions.                                              

    Semiannually we will send you a report containing the financial statements
of the Series Fund, including a list of securities held in each fund.           

Assigning your policy                                                           

    You may assign your rights in the policy to someone else as collateral for
a loan or for some other reason. Assignments do not require the consent of any  
revocable beneficiary. A copy of the assignment must be forwarded to us. We are 
not responsible for any payment we make or any action we take before we receive 
notice of the assignment in good order. Nor are we responsible for the validity 
of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of ownership. All         
collateral assignees of record must consent to any full surrender, partial      
withdrawal or loan from the policy.                                             

When we pay policy proceeds

General                                                                         

   We will pay any death benefit, withdrawal, surrender value or loan within
7 days after we receive the last required form or request (and, with respect to 
the death benefit, any other documentation that may be required). If we don't   
have information about the desired manner of payment within 7 days after the    
date we receive documentation of the insured person's death, we will pay the    
proceeds as a single sum.                                                       

Delay to challenge coverage                                                     

We may challenge the validity of your insurance policy based on any   
material misstatements made to us in the application for the policy. We cannot  
make such a challenge, however, beyond certain time limits that are specified   
in the policy.                                                                  

Delay for check clearance                                                       

We reserve the right to defer payment of that portion of your account 
value that is attributable to a premium payment made by check for a reasonable  
period of time (not to exceed 15 days) to allow the check to clear the banking  
system.                                                                         

Delay of separate account proceeds                                              

   We reserve the right to defer payment of any death benefit, loan or other
distribution that is derived from a variable investment option if (1) the New   
York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday         
closings) or trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) an       
emergency exists, as a result of which disposal of securities is not reasonably 
practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the account 
value; or (3) the SEC by order permits the delay for the protection of owners.  
Transfers and allocations of account value among the investment options may     
also be postponed under these circumstances. If we need to defer calculation of 
separate account values for any of the foregoing reasons, all delayed           
transactions will be processed at the next values that we do compute.           

Delay of general account surrender proceeds                                     

    State laws allow us to defer payment of any portion of the surrender value
derived from the fixed investment option for up to 6 months. These laws were    
enacted many years ago to help insurance companies in the event of a liquidity  
crisis.                                                                         

How you communicate with us

General rules                                                                   

You should mail or express all checks and money orders for premium    
payments and loan repayments to the John Hancock Servicing Office at the        
appropriate address shown on the back cover.

  Under our current rules, certain requests must be made in writing and be
signed and dated by you. They include the following:                            

o loans                                                               

o surrenders                                                          

o change of beneficiary                                               

o election of payment option for policy proceeds                      

o tax withholding elections                                           

o election of telephone transaction privilege                         

   The following requests may be made either in writing (signed and dated by
you) or by telephone or fax if a special form is completed (see "Telephone and
Facsimile Transactions" below):                                                 

o transfers of account value among investment options                 

  o change of allocation among investment options for new premium payments

    You should mail or express all written requests to our Servicing Office at
the appropriate address shown on the back cover. You should also send notice of 
the insured person`s death and related documentation to our Servicing Office.   
We don't consider that we've "received" any communication until such time as it 
has arrived at the proper place and in the proper and complete form.            

We have special forms that should be used for a number of the requests
mentioned above. You can obtain these forms from our Servicing Office or your   
John Hancock representative. Each communication to us must include your name,   
your policy number and the name of the insured person. We cannot process any    
request that doesn't include this required information. Any communication that  
arrives after the close of our business day, or on a day that is not a business 
day, will be considered "received" by us on the next following business day.    
Our business day currently closes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, but       
special circumstances (such as suspension of trading on a major exchange) may   
dictate an earlier closing time.                                                

Telephone and facsimile transactions                                            

If you complete a special authorization form, you can request loans,  
transfers among investment options and changes of allocation among investment   
options simply by telephoning us at 1-800-732-5543 or by faxing us at           
617-572-1571. Any fax request should include your name, daytime telephone       
number, policy number and, in the case of transfers and changes of allocation,  
the names of the investment options involved. We will honor telephone           
instructions from anyone who provides the correct identifying information, so   
there is a risk of loss to you if this service is used by an unauthorized       
person. However, you will receive written confirmation of all telephone         
transactions. There is also a risk that you will be unable to place your        
request due to equipment malfunction or heavy phone line usage. If this occurs, 
you should submit your request in writing.                                      

   If you authorize telephone transactions, you will be liable for any loss,
expense or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent telephone         
instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine, unless such loss,       
expense or cost is the result of our mistake or negligence. We employ           
procedures which provide safeguards against the execution of unauthorized       
transactions, and which are reasonably designed to confirm that instructions    
received by telephone are genuine. These procedures include requiring personal  
identification, tape recording calls, and providing written confirmation to the 
owner. If we do not employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions   
communicated by telephone are genuine, we may be liable for any loss due to     
unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.                                        

 As stated earlier in this prospectus, the policies are not designed for
professional market timing organizations or other persons or entities that use  
programmed or frequent transfers amoung investment options. For reasons such as 
that, we have imposed restrictions on transfers. However, we also reserve the   
right to change our telephone and facsimile transaction policies or procedures  
at any time. Moreover, we also reserve the right to suspend or terminate the    
privilege altogether with respect to any owners who we feel are abusing the     
privilege to the detriment of other owners.                                     

Distribution of policies                                                        

John Hancock Distributors LLC ("JH Distributors"), a Delaware limited 
liability company affiliated with us, is the principal distributor and          
underwriter of the securities offered through this prospectus and of other      
annuity and life insurance

products we and our affiliates offer. JH Distributors also acts as the          
principal underwriter of the John Hancock Trust, whose securities are used to   
fund certain investment options under the policies and under other annuity and  
life insurance products we offer.                                               

JH Distributors' principal address is 200 Bloor Street East, Toronto, 
Canada M4W 1E5 and it also maintains offices with us at 197 Clarendon Street,   
Boston, Massachusetts 02116. JH Distributors is a broker-dealer registered      
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and is a member of   
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD").              

We offer the policies for sale through individuals who are licensed as
insurance agents and who are registered representatives of broker-dealers that  
have entered into selling agreements with JH Distributors. These broker-dealers 
may include our affiliate Signator Investors, Inc.                              

   Through JH Distributors, John Hancock pays compensation to broker-dealers
for the promotion and sale of the policies. The registered representative       
through whom your policy is sold will be compensated pursuant to the registered 
representative's own arrangement with his or her broker-dealer. Compensation to 
broker-dealers for the promotion and sale of the policies is not paid directly  
by policyowners but will be recouped through the fees and charges imposed under 
the policy. (See "Description of charges at the policy level".)                 

A limited number of broker-dealers may also be paid commissions or    
overrides to "wholesale" the policies; that is, to provide marketing support    
and training services to the broker-dealer firms that do the actual selling. We 
may also provide compensation to a limited number of broker-dealers for         
providing ongoing service in relation to policies that have already been        
purchased.                                                                      

Standard compensation                                                           

  The compensation paid to sales representatives may vary depending on the
selling agreements, but commissions for sale of the policies (not including     
riders) are not expected to exceed 55% of the premium paid in the first policy  
year, 15% of the premium paid in the second policy year, 10% of the premium     
paid in the third through sixth policy years, 5% of the premium paid in the     
sixth through tenth policy years, and 3% of the premium paid in each policy     
year thereafter. The amount and timing of this compensation may differ among    
sales representatives, but would not be expected to materially exceed the       
foregoing schedule on a present value basis.                                    

Additional compensation and revenue sharing                                     

 To the extent permitted by SEC and NASD rules and other applicable laws
and regulations, selling broker-dealers may receive, directly or indirectly,    
additional payments in the form of cash, other compensation or reimbursement.   
These additional compensation or reimbursement arrangements may include, for    
example, payments in connection with the firm's "due diligence" examination of  
the policies, payments for providing conferences or seminars, sales or training 
programs for invited registered representatives and other employees, payment    
for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred by registered representatives  
and other employees for such seminars or training programs, seminars for the    
public, advertising and sales campaigns regarding the policies, payments to     
assist a firm in connection with its systems, operations and marketing expenses 
and/or other events or activities sponsored by the firms. Subject to applicable 
NASD rules and other applicable laws and regulations, JH Distributors and is    
affiliates may contribute to, as well as sponsor, various educational programs, 
sales contests, and/or other promotions in which participating firms and their  
sales persons may receive prizes such as merchandise, cash or other rewards.    

    These arrangements will not be offered to all firms, and the terms of such
arrangements may differ between firms. We provide additional information on     
special compensation or reimbursement arrangements involving selling firms and  
other financial institutions in the Statement of Additional Information, which  
is available upon request. Any such compensation, which may be significant at   
times, will not result in any additional direct charge to you by us.            

Differential compensation                                                       

Compensation negotiated and paid by John Hancock pursuant to a selling
agreement with a broker-dealer may differ from compensation levels that the     
broker-dealer receives for selling other variable policies or contracts. These  
compensation arrangements may give us benefits such as greater access to        
registered representatives. In addition, under their own arrangements,          
broker-dealer firms may pay a portion of any amounts received under standard or 
additional compensation or revenue sharing arrangements to their registered     
representatives. As a result, registered representatives may be motivated to

sell the policies of one issuer over another issuer, or one product over        
another product. You should contact your registered representative for more     
information on compensation arrangements in connection with your purchase of a  
policy.                                                                         

Tax considerations                                                              

This description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief   
summary and is not intended as tax advice. Tax consequences will vary based on  
your own particular circumstances, and for further information you should       
consult a qualified tax adviser. Federal, state and local tax laws, regulations 
and interpretations can change from time to time. As a result, the tax          
consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered, in some cases           
retroactively.                                                                  

 The policy may be used in various arrangements, including non-qualified
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, split dollar insurance      
plans, executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax 
consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and       
circumstances of each individual arrangement. Therefore, if the use of the      
policy in any such arrangment, the value of which depends in part on the tax    
consequences, is contemplated, a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for  
advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.                     

General                                                                         

Generally, death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not   
subject to income tax. Earnings on your account value are ordinarily not        
subject to income tax as long as we don't pay them out to you. If we do pay out 
any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal, all or   
part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the         
premiums you've paid and not subjected to income tax. However certain           
distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy      
benefits within the first 15 years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily  
taxable in whole or in part. (See "Other policy distributions" below.) Amounts  
you borrow are generally not taxable to you. (See "Policy loans" below.)        

However, some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a 
modified endowment contract. This can happen if you've paid premiums in excess  
of limits prescribed by the tax laws. Additional taxes and penalties may be     
payable for policy distributions of any kind. (See "7-pay premium limit and
modified endowment contract status" below.)                                     

Policy death benefit proceeds                                                   

We expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax
treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies. Section 7702 of the         
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") defines a life insurance contract for        
federal tax purposes. For a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract,  
it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline        
premium test. These tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the 
policy. We will monitor compliance with these standards. If we determine that a 
policy does not satisfy section 7702, we may take whatever steps are            
appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with Section 7702.       

    If the policy complies with Section 7702, the death benefit proceeds under
the policy should be excludable from the beneficiary's gross income under       
Section 101 of the Code.                                                        

Other policy distributions                                                      

    Increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience
will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received  
through actual or deemed distributions. In general, the owner will be taxed on  
the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy. An  
exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policy's 
death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the 
first 15 years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash            
distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply  
with the Section 7702 definitional limits. Changes that reduce benefits include 
partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes. For purposes of this rule 
any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in         
benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction. A cash             
distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part (to 
the extent of any gain in the policy) under rules prescribed in Section 7702.   
The taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section 7702(f)(7). Any   
taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner (rather than capital  
gain).                                                                          

   Distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or
partial withdrawals. You may also be deemed to have received a distribution for 
tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your     
policy's ownership.

It is possible that, despite our monitoring, a policy might fail to   
qualify as a life insurance contract under section 7702 of the Code. This could 
happen, for example, if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium    
payments that were in excess of permitted amounts, or if any of the funds       
failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the  
Code. If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on the income   
credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the                
disqualification and for subsequent periods.                                    

    Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal,
state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws will depend on the 
circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. If the person insured by the policy 
is also its owner, either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a    
revocabale trust, the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for 
purposes of the federal estate tax. If the owner is not the person insured, the 
value of the policy will be includible in the owner's estate upon his or her    
death. Even if ownership has been transferred, the death proceeds or the        
account value may be includible in the former owner's estate if the transfer    
occurred less than three years before the former owner's death or if the former 
owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy. You should consult     
your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences.                     

  Because there may be unfavorable tax consequences (including recognition
of taxable income and the loss of income tax-free treatment for any death       
benefit payable to the beneficiary), you should consult a qualified tax adviser 
prior to changing the policy's ownership or making any assignment of ownership  
interests.                                                                      

Policy loans                                                                    

We expect that, except as noted below (see "7-pay premium limit and
modified endowment contract status"), loans received under the policy will be   
treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will           
constitute income to the owner. However, if the policy terminates for any       
reason, the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered   
income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such     
termination. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under certain        
circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans, you might find      
yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your       
policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to      
occur.                                                                          

Diversification rules and ownership of the Account                              

Your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance 
contract unless the Account follows certain rules requiring diversification of  
investments underlying the policy. In addition, the rules require that the      
policy owner not have "investment control" over the underlying assets.          

 In certain circumstances, the owner of a variable life insurance policy
may be considered the owner, for federal income tax purposes, of the assets of  
the separate account used to support the policy. In those circumstances, income 
and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy    
owner's gross income. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has stated in        
published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of  
separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in 
those assets, such as the ability to exercise investment control over the       
assets. A Treasury Decision issued in 1986 stated that guidance would be issued 
in the form of regulations or rulings on the "extent to which Policyholders may 
direct their investments to particular sub-accounts of a separate account       
without being treated as owners of the underlying assets." As of the date of    
this prospectus, no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued. In    
Rev. Rul. 2003-91, however, the IRS ruled that a contract holder would not be   
treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity  
contract despite the owner's ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty  
subaccounts.                                                                    

 The ownership rights under your policy are similar to, but different in
certain respects from, those described in IRS rulings in which it was           
determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets. Since 
you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was  
the case in those rulings, it is possible that you would be treated as the      
owner of your policy's proportionate share of the assets of the Account.        

We do not know what future Treasury Department regulations or other   
guidance may require. We cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to        
operate as currently described in the Series Funds` prospectuses, or that a     
Series Fund will not have to change any fund's investment objectives or         
policies. We have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing  
so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policy's            
proportionate share of the assets of the Account, but we are under no           
obligation to do so.

7-pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status                      

At the time of policy issuance, we will determine whether the Planned 
Premium schedule will exceed the 7-pay limit discussed below. If so, our        
standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form      
acknowledging that fact.                                                        

 The 7-pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been
payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully "paid-up" after   
the payment of 7 equal annual premiums. "Paid-up" means that no further         
premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity,    
based on certain prescribed assumptions. If the total premiums paid at any time 
during the first 7 policy years exceed the 7-pay limit, the policy will be      
treated as a modified endowment contract, which can have adverse tax            
consequences.                                                                   

Policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the
following tax rules:                                                    

 o First, all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary
  income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess (if any) of the
policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in 
the policy at such time.                                                

o Second, loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or 
pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from
 the policy and taxed accordingly. Past-due loan interest that is added to
the loan amount is treated as an additional loan.                       

o Third, a 10% additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any     
distribution (including distributions on surrender) from, or loan taken 
 from or secured by, such a policy that is included in income except where
the distribution or loan:                                               

o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  
591/2;                                                                          

o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled; or           

o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the  
life (or life expectancy) of the policy owner or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancies) of the policy owner and the policy owner's 
beneficiary.                                                        

These exceptions to the 10% additional tax do not apply in situations 
where the policy is not owned by an individual.                                 

    Furthermore, any time there is a "material change" in a policy, the policy
will begin a new 7-pay testing period as if it were a newly-issued policy. The  
material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment  
contract are complex. In general, however, the determination of whether a       
policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally  
depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time 
of such change, the policy value at the time of the change, and the additional  
premiums paid into the Policy during the seven years starting with the date on  
which the material change occurs.                                               

  Moreover, if benefits under a policy are reduced (such as a reduction in
the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits)   
during the 7 years in which a 7-pay test is being applied, the 7-pay limit will 
generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits. If the premiums paid   
to date are greater than the recalculated 7-pay limit, the policy will become a 
modified endowment contract.                                                    

All modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer (or its   
affiliates) to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required   
to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified          
endowment contract rules. A policy received in exchange for a modified          
endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract. You       
should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible    
impact of the 7-pay limit on your policy.                                       

Corporate and H.R. 10 retirement plans                                          

 The policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement
plans satisfying the qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Code. If  
so, the Code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits      
thereunder should be carefully scrutinized. We are not responsible for          
compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of          
applicable provisions of the Code.                                              

Withholding                                                                     

To the extent that policy distributions to you are taxable, they are  
generally subject to withholding for your federal income tax liability. However 
if you reside in the United States, you can generally choose not to have tax    
withheld from distributions.

Life insurance purchases by residents of Puerto Rico                            

In Rev. Rul. 2004-75, 2004-31 I.R.B. 109, the Internal Revenue Service
ruled that income received by residents of Puerto Rico under life insurance     
policy issued by a United States company is U.S.-source income that is subject  
to United States federal income tax.                                            

Life insurance purchases by non-resident aliens                                 

  If you are not a U.S. citizen or resident, you will generally be subject
to U.S. federal withholding tax on taxable distributions from life insurance    
policies at a 30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, you    
may be subject to state and/or municipal taxes and taxes imposed by your        
country of citizenship or residence. You should consult with a qualified tax    
adviser before purchasing a policy.

 Provides Life Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Retirement Income

 for Key Executives at Minimal Net Cost to Sponsoring Business

 BOSTON, April 4 /PRNewswire/ --

 John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned
subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: JHF), has
added Medallion Executive Variable Life III (MEVL III) to its suite of
COLI products. This new corporate owned/sponsored life insurance
product is designed to meet the sophisticated needs of the highly
specialized executive benefits market.

 MEVL III is a highly flexible, variable universal life insurance policy intended specifically for funding multi-life executive benefit
plans, which can provide another tax-deferred option for executives.
When properly funded, the plans generally offer valuable life insurance
benefits for selected executives at retirement, as well as supplemental
retirement income at minimal net cost to the sponsoring business.

 MEVL III includes key features for corporate clients.

 -- When maximum funded, MEVL III offers over 100 percent first-year
cash

 values, which results in no charge to earnings

 -- It has a preferred underwriting category, as well as extremely

 competitive guaranteed issue rates

 -- It provides strong early, as well as long-term, cash value
growth when

 compared to other leading corporate-owned life insurance products

 -- Strong long-term cash value performance leads to higher death
benefit

 for cost recovery at death (strong internal rate of return at age
80)

 -- The product also provides the option to use an enhanced cash
value

 rider to attain even higher early surrender values.

 With MEVL III, a business can offer executives the option of
deferring a percentage of their salary above the maximum allowed under
401(k) plans. A minimum of three persons must be covered, with a total
face amount of $1 million. Guaranteed issue is available beginning at
10 lives assuming 100 percent participation. It also is available for
single life cases with $25,000 of annual premium.

 MEVL III offers a wide variety of retail and institutional
investment options managed by some of the nation's leading money
managers, as well as asset allocation tools and strong ongoing fund
oversight. The product complements MEVL, which performs better for
medium-funded business cases.

 "We believe we've hit the mark by building a state-of-the
art COLI product with the features that businesses demand. We expect to
attract a lot of new COLI business," says Karl Reinhold, general
director, estate and business planning.

 John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. and its affiliated companies
provide a broad array of insurance and investment products and services
to retail and institutional customers. As of December 31, 1999, John
Hancock and its subsidiaries had total assets under management of $127.3
billion.

 This product is not available in all states.

 Variable life insurance is sold by a prospectus. Please request a
prospectus, which contains more complete information, including charges
and expenses, and read it carefully before investing or sending money.

 Insurance products are underwritten by John Hancock Life Insurance
Company and John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company (not licensed
in New York). Securities are offered through Signator Investors, Inc.,
Member NASD, SIPC, Boston, MA 02117.

	SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS








	The nature of the policy





	The policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person.

	The policy is unsuitable as a short-term savings vehicle because of the
	substantial policy-level charges and the contingent deferred sales charge.

	We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy. The value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based on the
	investment results of the variable investment options that you choose. The amount we pay to the policys beneficiary upon the death of the insured person (we call this the death benefit) may be similarly affected. Thats why
	the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy. We call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments. We require that your first premium at least equal your first
	Required Premium (discussed below). Except as noted in the Detailed Information section of this prospectus, you can make any other premium payments you wish at any time. Thats why the policy is called a flexible premium
	policy. You can request that we bill you for amounts of premiums that exceed your Required Premium payments and you can subsequently request that we change the amount that we bill.




	If the life insurance protection is provided under a master group policy, the term policy as used in this prospectus refers to
	the certificate you will be issued and not to the master group policy.







	Summary of policy benefits








	Death benefit





	In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is called your Guaranteed Death Benefit. In the policy, this may also be referred to as the
	Sum Insured.




	When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans. There are
	three ways of calculating the death benefit. You choose which one you want in the application. The three death benefit options are:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 1 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the
	guideline premium and cash value corridor test (as described under The minimum insurance amount provision in the Detailed Information section of this prospectus).






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 2 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit plus your policys Excess Value (if any) on the date
	of death, or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 3 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the
	cash value accumulation test (as described below).










	Surrender of the policy





	You may surrender the policy in full at any time. If you do, we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy
	debt and less any contingent deferred sales charge and administrative surrender charge that then applies. This is called your surrender value. You must return your policy when you request a surrender.




	If you have not taken a loan on your policy, the account value of your policy will, on any given date, be equal to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the amount you invested,






	 





	 




	




	 





	plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen,






	 





	 




	




	 





	minus all charges we deduct, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	minus all withdrawals you have made.







	If you take a loan on your policy, your account value will be computed somewhat differently. This is discussed under Policy loans.







	Partial withdrawals





	Under our current administrative rules, you may make a partial withdrawal of your policys Excess Value, if any, once in each policy year after the first policy year (see Excess Value and its components). Each partial
	withdrawal must be at least




	 




	4







	Table of Contents




	$1,000. There is a $20 charge for each partial withdrawal. We will automatically reduce the account value of your policy by the amount of the withdrawal and the related charge.







	Policy loans





	You may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form. The minimum amount of each loan is $300. The maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula as described in your policy.
	Interest is charged on each loan. You can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance. You can repay all or part of a loan at any time. If there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies, it will be deducted
	from the death benefit. Policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your account value, and may also result in adverse tax consequences.







	Optional benefit riders





	When you apply for the policy, you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we
	make available. There are a number of such riders. Charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value.







	Investment options





	The policy offers a number of investment options, as listed on page 1 of this prospectus. These
	investment options are subaccounts of Separate Account V (the Account or Separate Account), a separate account operated by us under Michigan law. They cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies. Although the
	funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds, there are important differences between your investment options and publicly-traded mutual funds. You can transfer money from one investment
	option to another without tax liability. Moreover, any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you. If and when policy
	earnings are distributed (generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal), they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains. Also, you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be
	assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level. Such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options.







	Summary of policy risks








	Lapse risk





	If your policy enters a grace period, we will notify you of how much you will need to pay to keep the policy in force. You will have a
	grace period of at least 31 days after we mail the notice to make that payment. If you dont pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). If lapse occurs, youll be
	given the opportunity to reinstate the policy by making the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions.




	Since withdrawals reduce your account value, withdrawals increase the risk of lapse. Loans also increase the risk of lapse.







	Premium recalculation risk





	If you do not request a premium recalculation (as described under Premium
	recalculation) prior to the policy anniversary nearest the insured persons 69th birthday (or, if later, the ninth policy anniversary), then we will automatically perform the recalculation at the next policy anniversary. The recalculated
	base policy premium may be higher than the previous base policy premium.







	Investment risk





	As mentioned above, the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad. Your account value will rise or fall
	based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen. Some variable investment options are riskier than others. These risks (and potential rewards) are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the
	series funds.




	 




	5







	Table of Contents







	Access to funds risk





	There is a risk that you will not be able (or willing) to access your account value by surrendering the policy because of the contingent
	deferred sales charge (CDSC) that may be payable upon surrender. The CDSC is a percentage of the premiums youve paid and disappears only after 13 policy years have passed. See the Fee Tables section of this prospectus
	for details on the CDSC. There is also a charge for each partial withdrawal you make. It is usually $20. Any communication that arrives on a date that is not a business day will be processed on the business day next following that date. The term
	business day is defined under Your Investment Options.







	Transfer risk





	There is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the
	number of options you can invest in at one time. The limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts.







	Market timing risk





	Variable investment options in variable
	life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences. As
	a result, some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency. Whatever the reason, long-term investors in a variable investment option
	can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs and/or disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds
	investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies, both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for long-term investment.




	To discourage disruptive frequent trading activity, we impose restrictions on transfers (see Transfers of existing account
	value) and reserve the right to change, suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges (see How you communicate with us). In addition, we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading,
	including, but not limited to: (i) restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period, (ii) restricting the dollar amount of transfers, and (iii) restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts. We also
	reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund.




	While we
	seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity, it may not always be possible to do so.

	Therefore, no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and
	avoiding harm to long-term investors.








	Tax risks





	Life insurance death benefits are ordinarily not subject to income tax. Other Federal and state taxes may apply as further discussed below.
	In general, you will be taxed on the amount of lifetime distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy. Any taxable distribution will be treated as ordinary income (rather than as capital gains) for tax purposes.




	In order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), your policy
	must comply with certain requirements of the Code. We will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements, but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring. If this were to occur, you would be subject to
	income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods. The tax laws also contain a so-called 7-pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the
	policys death benefit. If the limit is violated, the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract, which can have adverse tax consequences. There are also certain Treasury Department rules referred to as the
	investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy. If that were determined to be the case, you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate. In
	other words, you would lose the value of the so-called inside build-up that is a major benefit of life insurance.





	There is also a tax risk associated with policy loans.

	Although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made, surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the
	time of lapse or surrender. This could result in a considerable tax bill. Under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age, you might find yourself having to choose between high premium
	requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur.

	Table of Contents




	Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under Federal, state and local
	estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. There can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership
	interests. For these and all the other reasons mentioned above,

	we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser

	before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy.

	FEE TABLES





	This section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying, owning and surrendering the
	policy. In the first three tables, certain entries show the minimum charge, the maximum charge and the charge for a representative insured person. Other entries show only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such. The remaining
	entries are always calculated in the same way, so we cannot assess a charge that is greater than the charge shown in the table. Except where necessary to show a rate greater than zero, all rates shown in the tables have been rounded to two decimal
	places as required by prospectus disclosure rules. Consequently, the actual rates charged may be slightly higher or lower than those shown.




	The first table below describes the fees and expenses that you will pay

	at the time that you pay a premium, surrender the policy or withdraw account value

	.

	The current charge applies only in policy years 1-10 and is only 3.5% for policies with face amounts equal to or greater than $250,000.






	 






	(2)






	The administrative surrender charge decreases in later policy years as follows: for policy years 7 and 8, it is $4 per $1,000 of Guaranteed Death Benefit; and for
	policy year 9, it is $3 per $1,000 of Guaranteed Death Benefit.

	The CDSC percentage decreases in later policy years as follows: for policy year 7, it is 12.85%; for policy year 8, it is 10%; for policy year 9, it is 7.77%; for
	policy year 10, it is 6%; for policy year 11, it is 4.55%; for policy year 12, it is 2.92%; for policy 13, it is 1.54%; and for policy years 14 and later, it is 0%.






	 






	(4)






	This charge is mandatory in that premium recalculation will automatically occur if not requested prior to the later of (i) the policy anniversary nearest the
	insured persons 69th birthday, or (ii) the ninth policy anniversary.






	 






	(5)






	This charge is determined in accordance with our underwriting rules and is assessed if the insured person does not qualify for either the preferred or standard
	underwriting class. Underwriting classifications are based upon a number of factors, the most important of which is medical history.

	The next two tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay

	periodically during
	the time you own the policy

	. These tables do

	not

	include fees and expenses paid at the fund level. Except for the M&E charge, the policy loan interest rate and a portion of the rider charges, all of the charges shown in the tables are
	deducted from your account value. The second table is devoted only to optional rider benefits.

	The insurance charge is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance for which we are at risk (the amount at risk or AAR) by the applicable cost of
	insurance rate. The rates vary widely depending upon the Sum Insured, the length of time the policy has been in effect, the insurance risk characteristics of the insured person and (generally) the gender of the insured person. The
	minimum rate shown in the table at the guaranteed rate is the rate in the first policy year for a $1,000,000 policy issued to cover a 10 year old female preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk. The minimum rate shown in the
	table at the current rate is the rate in the twelfth policy year for a $1,000,000 policy issued to cover a 0 year old female preferred non-tobacco underwriting risk. The maximum rate shown in the table at both the guaranteed and current
	rates is the rate in the first policy year for a $100,000 policy issued to cover a 99 year old male standard tobacco underwriting risk. The representative insured person referred to in the table is a 35 year old male standard non-tobacco
	underwriting risk with a $100,000 policy. The charges shown in the table may not be particularly relevant to your current situation. For more information about cost of insurance rates, talk to your John Hancock USA representative.

	This charge only applies to separate account assets (i.e., those assets invested in the variable investment options). The charge does not apply to the fixed
	investment option. The effective annual rate equivalents of the actual unrounded daily rates charged are .60% and .60%, respectively.






	 






	(3)






	5.0% is the effective annual interest rate we charge. The amount of any loan is transferred from the investment options to a special loan account which earns
	interest at an effective annual rate of 4.0% during policy years 1-20 and 4.50% thereafter. Therefore, the true cost of a loan is the difference between the loan interest we charge and the interest we credit to the special loan account.

	YRT stands for Yearly Renewable Term. The charge for this rider is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance under the rider by the
	applicable cost of insurance rate for the rider. The rate varies widely depending upon the amount of YRT coverage and the insurance risk characteristics and gender of the person insured under the rider. The minimum rate shown in the
	table is the rate for a rider with $1,000,000 of coverage issued to cover a 0 year old female preferred underwriting risk. The maximum rate shown in the table is the rate for a rider with $100,000 of coverage issued to cover a 99 year
	old male standard tobacco underwriting risk. The representative insured person referred to in the table is a 35 year old male standard non-tobacco underwriting risk with $100,000 of rider coverage. If the Disability Payment of Premium
	Rider is also elected, the charge for this rider will be increased by 54%. If the person covered under this rider is rated substandard, there will be an extra charge for this rider of up to $445.61 per $1,000 of YRT death benefit.






	 






	(2)






	The charge for this rider is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by the applicable rate. The rates vary by the issue age and
	the insurance risk characteristics of the insured person. The minimum rate shown in the table is for a 20 year old male tobacco underwriting risk. The maximum rate shown in the table is for an 85 year old female preferred
	non- tobacco underwriting risk. The representative insured person referred to in the table is a 35 year old male standard non-tobacco underwriting risk.






	 






	(3)






	The charge for this rider is determined by multiplying the total Required Premium for the base policy by the applicable rate. The rates vary widely depending upon
	the age and rider underwriting rating of the insured person. The minimum rate shown in the table is for a 17 year old insured person with a standard rider rating. The maximum rate shown in the table is for a 36 year old
	insured person with the maximum substandard rider rating. The representative insured person referred to in the table is a 35 year old with a standard rider rating.






	 






	(4)






	The charge for this rider is determined by multiplying the total Required Premium for the base policy and the charges for all other riders by the applicable rate.
	The rates vary widely depending upon the age of the applicant and the age of the insured person. The minimum rate shown in the table is for an 18 year old applicant and a 0 year old insured person. The maximum rate shown in
	the table is for a 50 year old applicant and a 14 year old insured person. The representative applicant and insured person referred to in the table are 35 and 0 years old, respectively.

	Total Operating Expenses may include fees and expenses incurred indirectly by a portfolio as a result of its investment in other investment companies (each an Acquired
	Fund), and in those cases the Total Operating Expenses will be expected to vary based upon an allocation of the portfolios assets among the Acquired Fund portfolios and upon the total annual operating expenses of these portfolios, and
	may be higher or lower than those shown in the table. The Total Operating Expenses shown in the table may not correlate to the portfolios ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the financial highlights section in the prospectus for
	the portfolios, which does not include Acquired Fund fees and expenses. For the International Equity Index B portfolio, Total Operating Expenses include Acquired Fund fees and expenses which are less than 0.01%.

	John Hancock Trust (the Trust) sells shares of
	these portfolios only to certain variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts of ours and our affiliates. Each portfolio is subject to an agreement between the Trust and the Adviser under which the Adviser has agreed to waive its
	advisory fee (or, if necessary, reimburse expenses of the portfolio) in an amount so that the rate of the portfolios Total Operating Expenses does not exceed its net operating expenses as listed below. A portfolios Total Operating
	Expenses includes all of its ordinary operating expenses, including advisory fees and 12b-1 fees, but excludes taxes, brokerage commissions, interest, litigation and indemnification expenses and extraordinary expenses (estimated at 0.01% or less of
	the portfolios average net assets) of the portfolio not incurred in the ordinary course of the portfolios business. Under the agreement, the Advisers obligation to provide the expense cap with respect to a particular portfolio will
	remain in effect until May 1, 2010 and will terminate after that date only if the Trust, without the prior written consent of the Adviser, sells shares of the portfolio to (or has shares of the portfolio held by) any person other than the
	variable life insurance or variable annuity separate accounts of ours or any of our affiliates that are specified in the agreement. The fees shown in the table do not reflect this expense cap. If this expense cap had been reflected, the net
	operating expenses for the portfolios would be as indicated below. For more information, please see the prospectus for the participating portfolios for additional information.

	Effective January 1, 2006, the Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive its advisory fee for certain portfolios or otherwise reimburse the expenses of those portfolios.
	The reimbursement will be equal, on an annualized basis, to 0.02% of that portion of the aggregate net assets of all the participating portfolios that exceeds $50 billion. The amount of the reimbursement will be calculated daily and allocated among
	all the participating portfolios in proportion to the daily net assets of each portfolio. The fees shown in the table do not reflect this waiver. If all applicable waivers or reimbursements had been reflected, the net operating expenses for these
	portfolios would be as indicated below. For more information, please see the prospectus for the participating portfolios for additional information.

	T.
	Rowe Price has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its subadvisory fee for certain portfolios. This waiver is based on the combined average daily net assets of these portfolios and the following funds of John Hancock Funds II: Blue Chip Growth,
	Equity-Income, Mid Value, Small Company Value, Spectrum Income and Real Estate Equity portfolios. The John Hancock Funds II portfolios are not offered under your policy. Based on the combined average daily net assets of the portfolios, the
	percentage fee reduction (as a percentage of the subadvisory fee) is as follows: 0% for the first $750 million, 5% for the next $750 million, 7.5% for the next $1.5 billion, and 10% if over $3 billion. The Adviser has also voluntarily agreed to
	reduce the advisory fee for each portfolio by the amount that the subadvisory fee is reduced. These voluntary fee waivers may be terminated by T. Rowe Price or the Adviser at any time. The fees shown in the table do not reflect these waivers. For
	more information, please see the prospectus for the underlying portfolios.







	5

	Other Expenses reflect an estimated expense based on a new custody fee pursuant to an agreement between the Trust and its custodian, which became effective on April 1, 2009.







	6

	Other Expenses do not include an
	interest expense which was charged in 2008. This expense is considered extraordinary and not anticipated in the future.







	7

	The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to reduce its advisory fee for a class of shares of the portfolio in an amount equal to the amount by which the ordinary
	expenses of such class of the portfolio exceed the expense limit (as a percentage of the average annual net assets of the portfolio attributable to the class) of 0.05% and, if necessary, to remit to that class of the portfolio an amount necessary to
	ensure that such expenses do not exceed that expense limit. Ordinary expenses means all the expenses of a class of the portfolio excluding advisory fees, 12b-1 fees, transfer agency fees and service fees, blue sky fees, taxes, portfolio brokerage
	commissions, interest, and litigation and indemnification expenses and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Trusts business. This expense limitation will continue in effect unless otherwise terminated by the
	Adviser upon notice to the Trust. This voluntary expense limitation may be terminated at any time. The fees shown in the table do not reflect this expense limitation. For more information, please refer to the prospectus for the underlying portfolio.

	DETAILED INFORMATION





	This section of the prospectus provides additional detailed information that is not contained in the Summary of Benefits and Risks section.










	Table of Investment Options and Investment Subadvisers





	When you select a Separate Account investment option, we invest your money in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the John Hancock Trust
	(the Trust or JHT) and hold the shares in a subaccount of the Separate Account. The Fee Tables show the investment management fees, Rule 12b-1 fees and other operating expenses for these portfolio shares as a percentage
	(rounded to two decimal places) of each portfolios average net assets for 2008, except as indicated in the footnotes appearing at the end of the table. Fees and expenses of the portfolios are not fixed or specified under the terms of the
	policies and may vary from year to year. These fees and expenses differ for each portfolio and reduce the investment return of each portfolio. Therefore, they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any Separate Account investment options
	you select.




	The John Hancock Trust is a so-called series type mutual fund and is registered under the Investment
	Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) as an open-end management investment company. John Hancock Investment Management Services, LLC (JHIMS) provides investment advisory services to the Trust and receives investment management fees
	for doing so. JHIMS pays a portion of its investment management fees to other firms that manage the Trusts portfolios. We are affiliated with JHIMS and may indirectly benefit from any investment management fees JHIMS retains.




	The portfolios pay us or certain of our affiliates compensation for some of the distribution, administrative, shareholder support, marketing
	and other services we or our affiliates provide to the portfolios. The amount of this compensation is based on a percentage of the assets of the portfolios attributable to the variable insurance products that we and our affiliates issue. These
	percentages may differ from portfolio to portfolio and among classes of shares within a portfolio. In some cases, the compensation is derived from the Rule 12b-1 fees that are deducted from a portfolios assets for the services we or our
	affiliates provide to that portfolio. These compensation payments do not, however, result in any charge to you in addition to what is shown in the Fee Tables.




	The following table provides a general description of the portfolios that underlie the variable investment options we make available under the policy. You bear the investment risk of any portfolio you
	choose as an investment option for your policy. You can find a full description of each portfolio, including the investment objectives, policies, and risks, in the prospectus for that portfolio. You should read the portfolios prospectus
	carefully before investing in the corresponding variable investment option.




	The investment options in the Separate Account
	are not publicly traded mutual funds. The investment options are only available to you as investment options in the policies, or in some cases through other variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies issued by us or by other life
	insurance companies. In some cases, the investment options also may be available through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement plans. The portfolios investment advisers and managers (i.e. subadvisers) may manage publicly
	traded mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives. However, the portfolios are not directly related to any publicly traded mutual fund. You should not compare the performance of any investment option described in this prospectus with
	the performance of a publicly traded mutual fund. The performance of any publicly traded mutual fund could differ substantially from that of any of the investment options of our Separate Account.




	The portfolios available under the policies are as described in the following table:

	To seek to approximate the aggregate total return of a broad-based U.S. domestic equity market index. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus
	any borrowings for investment purposes) at the time of investment in (a) the common stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index* and (b) securities (which may or may not be included in the S&P 500 Index) that the subadviser
	believes as a group will behave in a manner similar to the index. The subadviser may determine that the portfolios investments in certain instruments, such as index futures, total return swaps and exchanged traded
	portfolios (ETFs) have similar economic characteristics to investments that are in the S&P 500 Index.

	You bear the investment
	risk of any portfolio you choose as an investment option for your policy. A full description of each portfolio, including the investment objectives, policies and restrictions of, and the risks relating to investments in, each portfolio is contained
	in the portfolio prospectuses. The portfolio prospectuses should be read carefully before allocating purchase payments to an investment option.




	If the shares of a portfolio are no longer available for investment or in our judgment investment in a portfolio becomes inappropriate, we may eliminate the shares of a portfolio and substitute shares of
	another portfolio of the Trust or another open-end registered investment company. Substitution may be made with respect to both existing investments and the investment of future purchase payments. However, we will make no such substitution without
	first notifying you and obtaining approval of the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities and the SEC (to the extent required by the 1940 Act).




	We will purchase and redeem series fund shares for the Account at their net asset value without any sales or redemption charges. Shares of a series fund represent an interest in one of the funds of the
	series fund which corresponds to a subaccount of the Account. Any dividend or capital gains distributions received by the Account will be reinvested in shares of that same fund at their net asset value as of the dates paid.




	On each business day, shares of each series fund are purchased or redeemed by us for each subaccount based on, among other things, the
	amount of net premiums allocated to the subaccount, distributions reinvested, and transfers to, from and among subaccounts, all to be effected as of that date. Such purchases and redemptions are effected at each series funds net asset value
	per share determined for that same date. A business day is any date on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading. We compute policy values for each business day as of the close of that day (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).




	We will vote shares of the portfolios held in the Account at the shareholder meetings according to voting instructions
	received from persons having the voting interest under the policies. We will determine the number of portfolio shares for which voting instructions may be given not more than 90 days prior to the meeting. Proxy material will be distributed to each
	person having the voting interest under the contract together with appropriate forms for giving voting instructions. We will vote all portfolio shares that we hold (including our own shares and those we hold in the Account of policy owners) in
	proportion to the instructions so received.

	Table of Contents




	We determine the number of a series funds shares held in a subaccount attributable to
	each owner by dividing the amount of a policys account value held in the subaccount by the net asset value of one share in the fund. Fractional votes will be counted. We determine the number of shares as to which the owner may give
	instructions as of the record date for the series funds meeting. Owners of policies may give instructions regarding the election of the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of the series fund, ratification of the selection of independent
	auditors, approval of series fund investment advisory agreements and other matters requiring a shareholder vote. We will furnish owners with information and forms to enable owners to give voting instructions. However, we may, in certain limited
	circumstances permitted by the SECs rules, disregard voting instructions. If we do disregard voting instructions, you will receive a summary of that action and the reasons for it in the next semi-annual report to owners.




	The voting privileges described above reflect our understanding of applicable Federal securities law requirements. To the extent that
	applicable law, regulations or interpretations change to eliminate or restrict the need for such voting privileges, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with any such revised requirements. We also reserve the right, subject to compliance
	with applicable law, including approval of owners if so required, (1) to transfer assets determined by John Hancock USA to be associated with the class of policies to which your policy belongs from the Account to another separate account or
	subaccount, (2) to deregister the Account under the 1940 Act, (3) to substitute for the fund shares held by a subaccount any other investment permitted by law, and (4) to take any action necessary to comply with or obtain any
	exemptions from the 1940 Act. Any such change will be made only if, in our judgment, the change would best serve the interests of owners of policies in your policy class or would be appropriate in carrying out the purposes of such policies. We would
	notify owners of any of the forgoing changes and to the extent legally required, obtain approval of affected owners and any regulatory body prior thereto. Such notice and approval, however, may not be legally required in all cases.







	Description of John Hancock USA





	Effective December 31, 2009, we entered into a merger agreement with John Hancock Life Insurance Company (JHLICO) and John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company (JHVLICO)
	and assumed legal ownership of all of the assets of JHLICO and JHVLICO, including those assets related to John Hancock Variable Life Account V, the separate account that currently funds your policy. Effective at the time of the merger, we became the
	depositor of John Hancock Variable Life Account V (the Separate Account).




	Except for the succession of John
	Hancock USA as the depositor for the Separate Account and its assumption of the obligations arising under the policies, the merger did not affect the Separate Account or any provisions of, any rights and obligations under, or any of your allocations
	among investment options under, the policies. We will continue to administer and service inforce policies of JHLICO and JHVLICO in all jurisdictions where issued and will assume the direct responsibility for the payment of all claims and benefits
	and other obligations under these policies.




	We are a stock life insurance company and are currently licensed in the District
	of Columbia and all states of the United States, except New York. We were incorporated in Maine on August 20, 1955 by a special act of the Maine legislature and redomesticated under the laws of Michigan on December 30, 1992. Our ultimate
	parent is Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC), a publicly traded company based in Toronto, Canada. MFC is the holding company of John Hancock USA and its subsidiaries. However, neither John Hancock USA nor any of its affiliated
	companies guarantees the investment performance of the Separate Account.




	We are ranked and rated by independent financial
	rating services, which may include Moodys, Standard & Poors, Fitch and A.M. Best. The purpose of these ratings is to reflect the financial strength or claims-paying ability of the company, but they do not specifically relate to
	its products, the performance (return) of these products, the value of any investment in these products upon withdrawal or to individual securities held in any portfolio. These ratings do not apply to the safety and performance of the Separate
	Account.







	Description of Separate Account V





	The variable investment options shown on page 1 are in fact subaccounts of the Separate Account and initially established by JHVLICO under
	Massachusetts law. On December 31, 2009, as a result of the merger of JHLICO and JHVLICO into John Hancock USA, we became the owner of all the assets of the Separate Account and currently operate the Separate Account under Michigan law (see
	Description of John Hancock USA).




	 




	17







	Table of Contents




	The Separate Account meets the definition of separate account under the Federal
	securities laws and is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Such registration does not involve supervision by the SEC of the management of the Separate Account or of us.




	The Separate Accounts assets are our property. Each policy provides that amounts we hold in the Separate Account pursuant to the
	policies cannot be reached by any other persons who may have claims against us and cant be used to pay any indebtedness of John Hancock USA other than those arising out of policies that use the Separate Account. Income, gains and losses
	credited to, or charged against, the Separate Account reflect the Separate Accounts own investment experience and not the investment experience of John Hancock USAs other assets.




	New subaccounts may be added and made available to policy owners from time to time. Existing subaccounts may be modified or deleted at any
	time.







	The fixed investment option





	Our obligations under the policys fixed investment option are backed by our general account assets. Our general account consists of assets owned by us other than those in the Account and in other
	separate accounts that we may establish. Subject to applicable law, we have sole discretion over the investment of assets of the general account and policy owners do not share in the investment experience of, or have any preferential claim on, those
	assets. Instead, we guarantee that the account value allocated to the fixed investment option will accrue interest daily at an effective annual rate of at least 4% without regard to the actual investment experience of the general account.




	Because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in our fixed investment option have not been registered under the
	Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act) and our general account has not been registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, neither the general account nor any interests therein are subject to the provisions of these
	acts, and we have been advised that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosure in this prospectus relating to the fixed investment option. Disclosure regarding the fixed investment option are, however, subject to certain generally
	applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws relating to accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses.







	Premiums








	Premium payments





	We call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments. We require that your first premium at
	least equal your first Required Premium (discussed below). Except as noted below, you can make any other premium payments you wish at any time. You can request that we bill you for amounts of premiums that exceed your Required Premium
	payments and you can subsequently request that we change the amount that we bill.







	Maximum premium payments





	If you have chosen the Option 1 or Option 2 death benefit (see The Death Benefit), federal tax law limits the amount of
	premium payments you can make relative to the amount of your policys insurance coverage. We will not knowingly accept any amount by which a premium payment exceeds the maximum. If you exceed certain other limits, the law may impose a penalty
	on amounts you take out of your policy. Well monitor your premium payments and let you know if youre about to exceed this limit. (See Tax Considerations).




	Also, we may refuse to accept any amount of an additional premium if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	that amount of premium would increase our insurance risk exposure, and the insured person doesnt provide us with adequate evidence that he or she
	continues to meet our requirements for issuing insurance, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	that amount of premium would cause the cumulative premiums you have paid to date to exceed the cumulative scheduled premiums due to date under the
	policy.







	In no event, however, will we refuse to accept any premium necessary to prevent the policy from
	terminating.







	Required premiums





	The Policy Specifications page of your policy will show the Required Premium for the policy. In the policy application, you will choose one of the following modes of premium
	payment  annual, semi-annual, quarterly or




	 




	18







	Table of Contents




	monthly. We make no additional charge for any of these choices of payment mode. You can request that we change your payment mode at any time.




	The scheduled date on which such a payment is due is referred to in the policy as a modal processing date. Premiums
	are scheduled to be paid for the whole of the insured persons lifetime. If, on any modal processing date, the cumulative amount of all premium payments you have made does not equal or exceed the cumulative amount of all Required Premiums due
	through that date, your policy will enter a grace period, unless your policy has Excess Value as of that date. For purposes of determining whether enough premiums have been paid as of any modal processing date, we reduce the amount of premiums you
	have paid by the amount of any withdrawals you have taken from what we consider to be the premium component of any Excess Value in your policy (see below).







	Excess Value and its components





	As of the last business
	day in each policy month, we compare the account value of the policy against the Basic Account Value (described below) to determine if any Excess Value exists under the policy. Excess Value is any amount of account value
	greater than the Basic Account Value. If you wish to know the amount of Excess Value at any time, just contact our Servicing Office.




	The Basic Account Value generally increases over the life of the policy, as the attained age of the insured person increases. Basic Account Value can be thought of as what the guaranteed cash value would be under an otherwise comparable
	non-variable whole life policy. It is the amount we deem necessary to support your policys benefits at any time based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions. See How we calculate Basic Account Value below for further
	details.




	Excess Value may arise from two sources. The premium component is that portion of Excess Value up to the
	amount by which the cumulative premiums paid (excluding amounts from this component previously withdrawn) exceed the cumulative amount of Required Premiums due to date. The experience component is that portion of Excess Value above the
	premium component and arises out of favorable investment experience or lower than maximum insurance and expense charges.







	How we calculate Basic Account Value





	The Basic Account Value at any time is what the
	policys account value would have been at that time if (1) level annual premiums (and no additional premiums) had been paid in the amount of the maximum guaranteed recalculation premium at issue and earned a constant net return of
	4% per annum and (2) the cost of insurance charges had been deducted at the maximum rates set forth in the policy, and no other charges. The maximum guaranteed recalculation premium at issue is described under Premium
	recalculation and its amount is specified in each policy.




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a policy loan
	outstanding, the Basic Account Value will not be less than 110% of the outstanding loan. Also, in all cases where optional rider benefits have been selected, or the insured person is in a substandard risk category, an additional amount will be added
	in computing the Basic Account Value to cover these items through the end of the then-current policy year.









	Lapse





	If your policy enters a grace period, we will notify you of how much you will need to pay to keep the policy in
	force. You will have a grace period of at least 31 days after we mail the notice to make that payment. If you dont pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace period, your policy will terminate (i.e., lapse). If the
	insured person dies during the grace period, we will deduct any unpaid monthly charges from the death benefit. During the grace period, you cannot make transfers among investment options or make a partial withdrawal or policy loan.







	Options on lapse





	If a policy lapses, we apply the surrender value on the date of lapse to one of three options for continued insurance that does not require further payment of premium: Variable Paid-Up Insurance, Fixed Paid-Up Insurance or Fixed Extended
	Term Insurance on the life of the insured person, commencing on the date of lapse.




	Both the Variable and Fixed Paid-Up
	Insurance options provide an amount of paid-up whole life insurance, determined in accordance with the policy, which the surrender value will purchase. The amount of Variable Paid-Up Insurance may then increase or decrease, subject to any guarantee,
	in response to the investment experience of the variable investment options. The Fixed Paid-Up Insurance option provides a fixed and level amount of insurance. The Fixed Extended Term Insurance




	 




	19







	Table of Contents




	option provides a fixed amount of insurance determined in accordance with the policy, with the insurance coverage continuing for as long a period as the available policy surrender value will
	purchase.




	The Variable Paid-Up Insurance option is not available unless its initial amount is at least $5,000. If you have
	elected no option before the end of the grace period, the Fixed Extended Term Insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of Fixed Paid-Up Insurance would equal or exceed the amount of Fixed Extended Term Insurance or unless the insured
	person is a substandard risk. In either of the latter cases, Fixed Paid-Up Insurance is provided.




	You may surrender a policy
	that is being continued under any of these options for the options surrender value while the insured person is living. Loans may be available under the Variable and Fixed Paid-Up Insurance options.







	Reinstatement





	You can still reactivate (i.e., reinstate) a lapsed policy within 3 years from the beginning of the grace period, unless the surrender value has been paid out or otherwise exhausted or the period of any Fixed Extended Term
	Insurance has expired. You will have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing coverage. You will also have to pay a minimum amount of premium and be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to
	reinstatements, as specified in the policy.







	Amount of required premiums





	We initially determine the amount of your scheduled premium at the time your policy is issued, in accordance with our established rules and
	rates. It consists of a base policy premium plus certain additional amounts if the insured person presents an extra mortality risk to us or if you have purchased certain additional insurance benefits. These amounts will be set forth in
	the Policy Specifications section of your policy as the components of your Required Premium.




	The base
	policy premium is the amount of the Required Premium for an insured person in the standard underwriting risk class who has not purchased any additional insurance benefits by rider. The base policy premium will not change until the
	Required Premium recalculation discussed below, or until such time as you partially surrender the policy.







	Premium
	recalculation





	You may make a one-time request that we recalculate your base policy premium at any time not later than the
	policy anniversary nearest the insured persons 69th birthday (or, if later, the ninth policy anniversary). The base policy premium that results from the recalculation will apply to all periods subsequent to the recalculation. That resulting
	base policy premium may be higher or lower than, or the same as, the previous base policy premium. This, in turn, will determine whether the Required Premium will be higher, lower or stay the same for those subsequent periods. If your right to
	request a premium recalculation expires without your having exercised it, we will automatically perform the premium recalculation at the next policy anniversary.




	The premium recalculation feature makes it possible for us to set a lower base policy premium (and thus a lower Required Premium) at the time the policy is issued than would be possible without this
	feature. If you wish to lock in a base policy premium (and Required Premium) at any time prior to the features expiration, you can do so by requesting a premium recalculation.




	The amount of the new base policy premium after a premium recalculation depends on the insured persons sex, smoking status, attained
	age, the guaranteed death benefit under the policy and the account value at the close of the business day that precedes the recalculation. The new base policy premium will never exceed the policys guaranteed maximum recalculation
	premium based on the insured persons attained age at the time of the recalculation. The guaranteed maximum recalculation premium for each attained age will appear in the Policy Specifications section of your policy.




	The guaranteed maximum recalculation premium increases as the insured persons attained age increases. Accordingly, by
	delaying the premium recalculation, you assume the risk that the base policy premium following the recalculation will be higher than it would have been had the recalculation been performed at an earlier date. The longer the delay and the lower the
	policys account value, the greater the risk. On the other hand, by postponing the premium recalculation, you may benefit from (1) a lower base policy premium prior to the recalculation and (2) a longer period to accumulate enough
	account value to reduce the possibility (or amount) of an increase in the base policy premium at the time of the recalculation.

	Table of Contents




	If your policy has any Excess Value at the time of the premium recalculation, the base
	policy premium will be less following the recalculation than it would have been had the recalculation been performed at the earliest possible date (i.e., at the time of policy issuance). Otherwise it will be more.




	As an example, consider a policy issued to a male standard risk non-smoker age 35 at issue with Death Benefit Option 1 in the amount of
	$100,000 and assuming current charge rates. If no premium recalculation is made at policy issuance, the base policy premium for the policy would be $900 until such time as the premium recalculation is made. Assuming that amount of premium is paid
	annually until the premium recalculation, and assuming constant gross annual investment returns at the rates set forth below, the following table illustrates what the base policy premium would be following a recalculation on the dates shown.

	Mandatory premium recalculation if you do not choose earlier date.







	We will make a one-time charge if the new base policy premium is less than the guaranteed maximum recalculation premium
	that would have applied had the recalculation been done at the time the policy was issued. The charge will not exceed 3% (currently 1


	 1



	/

	%) of the policys Excess Value exceeds at the time of the premium recalculation. See Guaranteed death benefit charge.





	The amount of any account value that is considered Excess Value under your policy may increase or decrease as a result of a premium
	recalculation. See Excess Value and its components above.







	Ways to pay premiums





	If you pay premiums by check or money order, they must be drawn on a U.S. bank in U.S. dollars and made payable to John Hancock
	Life. We will not accept credit card checks. We will not accept starter or third party checks if they fail to satisfy our administrative requirements. Premiums after the first must be sent to our Service Office at the appropriate address shown
	on the back cover of this prospectus.




	We will also accept premiums:



	 





	 




	




	 





	by wire or by exchange from another insurance company,






	 





	 




	




	 





	via an electronic funds transfer program (any owner interested in making monthly premium payments must use this method), or






	 





	 




	




	 





	if we agree to it, through a salary deduction plan with your employer.







	You can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by contacting your John Hancock USA representative or by contacting our
	Service Office.







	Processing premium payments





	We will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it, unless one of the following exceptions applies:




	(1) We will process a payment received prior to a policys date of issue as if received on the business day immediately preceding
	the date of issue.




	(2) If you pay a sufficient premium to take your policy out of a grace period, the portion of such
	premium that equals the overdue Required Premium will be processed as of that Required Premiums due date.




	 




	21







	Table of Contents




	(3) If the first Required Premium is not received prior to the date of issue, we will
	process each premium payment received thereafter as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the first Required Premium is received.




	(4) We will process the portion of any premium payment for which we require evidence of the insured persons continued
	insurability only after we have received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us.




	(5) If we receive any premium
	payment that we think will cause a policy to become a modified endowment or will cause a policy to lose its status as life insurance under the tax laws, we will not accept the excess portion of that premium payment and will immediately notify the
	owner. We will refund the excess premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking system (but in no case more than two weeks after receipt), except in the following circumstances:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be made; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	The tax problem relates to modified endowment contract status and we receive a signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date
	instructing us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues involved.







	In the above cases, we will
	treat the excess premium as having been received on the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed acknowledgment. We will then process it accordingly.




	(6) If a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be processed (as specified above) on a date that is not a business day,
	the premium payment will be processed on the business day next following that date.







	The death benefit





	In your application for the policy, you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person. This is
	called your Guaranteed Death Benefit. In the policy, this may also be referred to as the Sum Insured.




	When the insured person dies, we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans. There are 3 ways of calculating the death benefit. You must choose which one you want in the application. The three death benefit options are:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 1 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the
	guideline premium and cash value corridor test (as described below).






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 2 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit plus your policys Excess Value (if any) on the date
	of death, or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 3 - The death benefit will equal the greater of (1) the Guaranteed Death Benefit or (2) the minimum insurance amount under the
	cash value accumulation test (as described below).







	For the same premium payments, the death
	benefit under Option 2 will tend to be higher than the death benefit under Options 1 or 3. On the other hand, the monthly insurance charge will be higher under Option 2 to compensate us for the additional insurance risk. Because of that, the account
	value will tend to be higher under Options 1 or 3 than under Option 2 for the same premium payments.







	Limitations on payment
	of death benefit





	If the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods (generally within two years from the
	Issue Date of the policy), the amount payable will be equal to the premiums paid, less the amount of any policy debt on the date of death, and less any withdrawals, unless otherwise provided by your policy.




	Also, if an application misstated the age or sex of either of the insured persons, we will adjust, if necessary, the Base Face Amount, any
	Supplemental Face Amount, and every other benefit to that which would have been purchased at the correct age or sex by the most recent cost of insurance charges or as otherwise provided by your policy.







	The minimum insurance amount





	In order for a policy to qualify as life insurance under Federal tax law, there has to be a minimum amount of insurance in relation to account value. There are two tests that can be applied under Federal
	tax law. Death benefit Options 1 and 2 use the guideline premium and cash value corridor test while Option 3 uses the cash value accumulation test. For Options 1 and 2, we compute the minimum insurance amount each business
	day by multiplying the account value on that date by the so-called corridor factor applicable on that date. The corridor factors are derived by applying the guideline premium and cash




	 




	22







	Table of Contents




	value corridor test. The corridor factor starts out at 2.50 for ages at or below 40 and decreases as attained age increases, reaching a low of 1.0 at age 95. A table showing the factor for
	each age will appear in the policy. For Option 3, we compute the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on that date by the so-called death benefit factor applicable on that date. The death benefit
	factors are derived by applying the cash value accumulation test. The death benefit factor decreases as attained age increases. A table showing the factor for each age will appear in the policy.







	Change of Sum Insured





	You may request a decrease in your Sum Insured at any time, subject to our administrative rules in effect at the time. If approved, any such decrease will be effective on the monthly processing date next
	following our receipt of the request. A pro- rata portion of any contingent deferred sales charge will be deducted from your account value as a result of any such decrease.




	Under our current administrative rules, you cannot request an increase in your Sum Insured.







	Change of death benefit option





	On any policy anniversary after the first, you may request to change your coverage from death benefit Option 1 to Option 2 or vice-versa. If you request a change from Option 1 to Option 2, we will require
	evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing coverage. This is because such a change increases our insurance risk exposure. If you have chosen death benefit Option 3, you can never change to either Option 1 or Option 2.







	Partial surrenders





	You may partially surrender your policy upon submission of a written request satisfactory to us in accordance with our rules. Currently, the policy after partial surrender must have a Guaranteed Death
	Benefit at least as large as the minimum amount for which we would issue a policy on the life of the insured person. The Required Premium for the policy will be adjusted to prospectively reflect the new Guaranteed Death Benefit. A pro-rata portion
	of the account value will be paid to you and a pro-rata portion of any contingent deferred sales charge and any administrative surrender charge will be deducted. Possible alternatives to the partial surrender of the policy would be withdrawal of
	some or all of your Excess Value or taking a policy loan.







	Effective date of certain policy transactions





	The following transactions take effect on the policy anniversary on or next following the date we approve your request:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Face amount increases, when and if permitted by our administrative rules






	 





	 




	




	 





	Change of death benefit option







	Face amount decreases take effect on the monthly deduction date on or next following the date we approve the request for decrease.







	Tax consequences of coverage changes





	Please read Tax
	considerations to learn about possible tax consequences of changing your insurance coverage under the policy.







	Your
	beneficiary





	You name your beneficiary when you apply for the policy. The beneficiary is entitled to the proceeds we pay
	following the insured persons death. You may change the beneficiary during the insured persons lifetime. Such a change requires the consent of any

	irrevocable

	named beneficiary. A new beneficiary designation is effective as of the
	date you sign it, but will not affect any payments we make before we receive it. If no beneficiary is living when the insured person dies, we will pay the insurance proceeds to the owner or the owners estate.







	Ways in which we pay out policy proceeds





	You may choose to receive proceeds from the policy as a single sum. This includes proceeds that become payable because of death or full surrender. As permitted by state law and our current administrative
	procedures, death claim proceeds may be placed into an interest-bearing John Hancock USA retained asset account in the beneficiarys name. We will provide




	 




	23







	Table of Contents




	the beneficiary with a checkbook, so checks may be written for all or a part of the proceeds. The retained asset account is part of our general account and is subject to the claims of our
	creditors. It is not a bank account and it is not insured by the FDIC. We may receive a benefit from managing proceeds held in a retained asset account. Please contact our Service Office for more information. Alternatively, you can elect to have
	proceeds of $1,000 or more applied to any of a number of other payment options, including the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 1 - Proceeds left with us to accumulate with interest






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 2A - Equal monthly payments of a specified amount until all proceeds are paid out






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 2B - Equal monthly payments for a specified period of time






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 3 - Equal monthly payments for life, but with payments guaranteed for a specific number of years






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 4 - Equal monthly payments for life with no refund






	 





	 




	




	 





	Option 5 - Equal monthly payments for life with a refund if all of the proceeds havent been paid out







	You cannot choose an option if the monthly payments under the option would be less than $50. We will issue a supplementary agreement when
	the proceeds are applied to any alternative payment option. That agreement will spell out the terms of the option in full. We will credit interest on each of the above options. For Options 1 and 2A, the interest will be at least an effective annual
	rate of 3.50%. If no alternative payment option has been chosen, proceeds may be paid as a single sum.







	Changing a payment
	option





	You can change the payment option at any time before the proceeds are payable. If you havent made a choice,
	the payee of the proceeds has a prescribed period in which he or she can make that choice.







	Tax impact of payment option
	chosen





	There may be tax consequences to you or your beneficiary depending upon which payment option is chosen. You should
	consult with a qualified tax adviser before making that choice.







	The account value





	From each premium payment you make, we deduct the charges described under Deductions from premium payments. We invest the rest
	in the investment options youve elected. Special investment rules apply to premiums processed prior to the Allocation Date (see Processing premium payments).




	Over time, the amount youve invested in any

	variable

	investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had
	invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of a series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares; except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your account
	value. We describe these charges under Description of charges at the policy level. We calculate the unit values for each investment account once every business day as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, usually 4:00
	p.m. Eastern time. Sales and redemptions within any investment account will be transacted using the unit value next calculated after we receive your request either in writing or other form that we specify. If we receive your request before the close
	of our business day, well use the unit value calculated as of the end of that business day. If we receive your request at or after the close of our business day, well use the unit value calculated as of the end of the next business day.
	If a scheduled transaction falls on a day that is not a business day, well process it as of the end of the next business day.




	The amount youve invested in the

	fixed

	investment option will earn interest at a rate we declare from time to time. We guarantee that this rate will be at least 4%. If you want to know what the current declared rate is, just
	call or write to us. Amounts you invest in a fixed investment option will not be subject to the mortality and expense risk charge or the guaranteed death benefit charge. Otherwise, the policy level charges applicable to the fixed investment option
	are the same as those applicable to the variable investment options.







	Commencement of investment performance





	All premium payments will be allocated among the investment options on the date as of which they are processed (as discussed under
	Processing Premium Payments).




	 




	24







	Table of Contents







	Allocation of future premium payments





	At any time, you may change the investment options in which future premium payments will be invested. You make the original allocation in
	the application for the policy. The percentages you select must be in whole numbers and must total 100%.







	Transfers of
	existing account value





	You may also transfer your existing account value from one investment option to another. To do so,
	you must tell us how much to transfer, either as a whole number percentage or as a specific dollar amount. A confirmation of each transfer will be sent to you.





	The policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among investment options.

	As a consequence, we have
	reserved the right to impose limits on the number and frequency of transfers into and out of

	variable

	investment options and to impose a charge of up to $25 for any transfer beyond an annual limit (which will not be less than 12). Under our

	current

	rules, we impose no charge on transfers but we do impose the following restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options. Transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional limitations noted
	below.




	Our current practice is to restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two

	per calendar month

	(except with respect to those policies described in the following paragraphs). For purposes of this restriction, and in applying the limitation on the number of free transfers made during the period from the opening of a business day (usually
	9:00 a.m. Eastern time) to the close of that business day (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) are considered one transfer. You may, however, transfer to the Money Market B investment option even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached, but
	only if 100% of the account value in

	all

	variable investment options is transferred to the Money Market B investment option. If such a transfer to the Money Market B investment option is made then, for the 30 calendar day period after such
	transfers, no transfers from the Money Market B investment option to any other investment options (variable or fixed) may be made. If your policy offers a dollar cost averaging or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program, any transfers
	pursuant to such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on frequent trading. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions.




	Policies such as yours may be purchased by a corporation or other entity as a means to informally finance the liabilities created by an
	employee benefit plan, and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan. Policies sold under these circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions. In lieu of the two
	transfers per month restriction, we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits: (i) during the 10 calendar day period after any account values are
	transferred from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option, the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they are transferred into the Money Market B investment option; and (ii) any
	account values that would otherwise not be transferable by application of the 10 day limit described above and that are transferred into the Money Market B investment option may not be transferred out of the Money Market B investment option into any
	other investment options (variable or fixed) for 30 calendar days. The restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions. If we change any of the above rules relating to transfers, we
	will notify you of the change.




	Subject to our approval, we may offer policies purchased by a corporation or other entity that
	has purchased policies tp match its liabilities under an employee benefit plan, as described above, the ability to electronically rebalance the investment options in its policies. Under these circumstances, in lieu of imposing any specific limit
	upon the number or timing of transfers, we will monitor aggregate trades among the sub-accounts for frequency, pattern and size for potentially harmful investment practices. If we detect trading activity that we believe may be harmful to the overall
	operation of any investment account or underlying portfolio, we may impose conditions on policies employing electronic rebalancing to submit trades, including setting limits upon the number and timing of transfers, and revoking privileges to make
	trades by any means other than written communication submitted via U.S. mail.




	While we seek to identify and prevent
	disruptive frequent trading activity, it may not always be possible to do so. Therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to long-term
	investors. The restrictions described in these paragraphs will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions.

	Rule 22c-2 under the 1940 Act requires us to provide tax identification numbers and other
	policy owner transaction information to the Trust or to other investment companies in which the Separate Account invests, at their request. An investment company will use this information to identify any pattern or frequency of investment account
	transfers that may violate their frequent trading policy. An investment company may require us to impose trading restrictions in addition to those described above if violations of their frequent trading policy are discovered.

	You can only make such a transfer once a year and only during the 31 day period following your policy anniversary.






	 





	 




	




	 





	We must receive the request for such a transfer during the period beginning 60 days prior to the policy anniversary and ending 30 days after it.






	 





	 




	




	 





	The most you can transfer at any one time is the greater of $500 or 20% of the assets in your fixed investment option.







	We reserve the right to impose a minimum amount limit on transfers out of the fixed investment option.







	Limitation on number of investment options





	Whether through the allocation of premium or through the transfer of existing account value, you can never be invested in more than ten investment options at any one time.







	Surrender and partial withdrawals








	Full surrender





	You may surrender your policy in full at any time. If you do, we will
	pay you the account value, less any policy debt and less any CDSC and administrative surrender charge that then applies. This is called your surrender value. You must return your policy when you request a full surrender. We process
	surrenders as of the day we receive the surrender request.







	Partial withdrawal





	Under our current administrative rules, you may make a partial withdrawal of your policys Excess Value, if any, once in each policy
	year after the first policy year (see Excess Value and its components). Each partial withdrawal must be at least $1,000. There is a $20 charge for each partial withdrawal. We will automatically reduce the account value of your policy by
	the amount of the withdrawal and the related charge. Each investment option will be reduced in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among them.







	Policy loans





	You may borrow from your policy at any time
	after it has been in effect for 1 year by completing a form satisfactory to us or, if the telephone transaction authorization form has been completed, by telephone. The maximum amount you can borrow is equal to 100% of that portion of your surrender
	value that is attributable to the fixed investment option plus one of the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	In policy years 2 and 3 - 75% of that portion of your surrender value that is attributable to the variable investment options






	 





	 




	




	 





	In all later policy years - 90% of that portion of your surrender value that is attributable to the variable investment options







	The minimum amount of each loan is $300, unless the loan is used to pay premiums. The interest charged on
	any loan is an effective annual rate of 5.00%. Accrued interest will be added to the loan daily and will bear interest at the same rate as the original loan amount. The amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options in the same
	proportion as the account value is then allocated among them and is placed in a special loan account. This special loan account will earn interest at an effective annual rate of 4.00% for the first 20 policy years and 4.5% thereafter. The tax
	consequences of a loan interest credited differential of 0% are unclear. You should consult a tax adviser before effecting a loan to evaluate possible tax consequences. If we determine that a loan will be treated as a taxable distribution because of
	the differential between the loan interest rate and the rate being credited on the special loan account, we reserve the right to decrease the rate credited on the special loan account to a rate that would, in our reasonable judgement, result in the
	transaction being treated as a loan under




	 




	26







	Table of Contents




	Federal tax law. The right to increase the rate charged on the loan is restricted in some states. Please see your John Hancock USA representative for details. We process policy loans as of the
	day we receive the loan request.







	Repayment of policy loans





	You can repay all or part of a loan at any time. Each repayment will be allocated among the investment options as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The same proportionate part of the loan as was borrowed from the fixed investment option will be repaid to the fixed investment option.






	 





	 




	




	 





	The remainder of the repayment will be allocated among the investment options in the same way a new premium payment would be allocated.







	If you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment, you must include instructions to that effect. Otherwise, all payments
	will be assumed to be premium payments. We process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment.







	Effects of
	policy loans





	The account value, the net cash surrender value, and any death benefit above the Total Sum Insured are
	permanently affected by any loan, whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part. This is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account. The investment options and the special loan
	account will generally have different rates of investment return.




	The amount of the outstanding loan (which includes accrued
	and unpaid interest) is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable.




	Whenever the
	outstanding loan exceeds the surrender value, the policy will terminate 31 days after we have mailed notice of termination to you (and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address) specifying the minimum amount that must be
	paid to avoid termination, unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period. Also, taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged
	on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account.

	Policy loans may also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances (see Tax considerations).








	Description of charges at the policy level








	Deductions from premium payments




	 





	 




	




	 






	Premium tax charge

	- A charge to cover state premium taxes we currently expect to pay, on average. This charge is currently 2.35% of each
	premium.






	 





	 




	




	 






	DAC tax charge

	- A charge to cover the increased Federal income tax burden that we currently expect will result from receipt of premiums. This
	charge is currently 1.25% of each premium.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Premium sales charge

	- A charge to help defray our sales costs. The charge is 5% of the premiums you pay each policy year that do not total more
	than the Required Premium for that policy year. We currently waive 30% of this charge for policies with a Guaranteed Death Benefit of $250,000 or higher, but continuation of that waiver is not guaranteed.







	Also, we currently intend to stop making this charge on premiums received after the 10th policy year, but this is not guaranteed either.







	Deductions from account value




	 





	 




	




	 






	Issue charge

	- A monthly charge to help defray our administrative costs. This is a flat dollar charge of $20 and is deducted only during the
	first policy year.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Maintenance charge

	- A monthly charge to help defray our administrative costs. This is a flat dollar charge of up to $8 (currently $6).






	 





	 




	




	 






	Insurance charge

	- A monthly charge for the cost of insurance. To determine the charge, we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at
	risk by a cost of insurance rate. The rate is derived from an actuarial table. The table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates. The cost of insurance rates that we currently apply are generally less than the maximum rates. We
	will review the cost of insurance rates at least every 5 years and may change them from time to time. However, those rates will never be more than rates based on the 1980 Commissioners







	 




	27







	Table of Contents






	 





	Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables. The table of rates we use will depend on the insurance risk characteristics and (usually) gender of the insured person, the Guaranteed Death Benefit and the
	length of time the policy has been in effect. Regardless of the table used, cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy, as the insured persons attained age increases. (The insured persons attained
	age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date.) If the Guaranteed Death Benefit at issue is $100,000 or more, the insured person may be eligible for the preferred underwriting class, which has the lowest cost
	of insurance charges for policies of this type. In addition, we currently apply a lower insurance charge for policies with a Guaranteed Death Benefit of $250,000 or higher, but continuation of that practice is not guaranteed. Also, it is our current
	intention to reduce the insurance charge in the 10th policy year and thereafter below what it otherwise would be, but such a reduction is not guaranteed either.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Guaranteed death benefit charge

	- A monthly charge for our guarantee that the death benefit will never be less than the Guaranteed Death
	Benefit. This charge is currently 1¢ per $1,000 of the Guaranteed Death Benefit at the time the charge is deducted. We guarantee that this charge will never exceed 3¢ per $1,000 of the Guaranteed Death Benefit at the time the
	charge is deducted.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Extra mortality risk charge

	- An insured person who does not qualify for either the preferred or standard underwriting class must pay an
	additional Required Premium because of the extra mortality risk. We collect this additional premium in two ways: up to 8.6% of the additional premium is deducted from premiums when paid and the remainder of the additional premium is deducted monthly
	from your policys account value in equal installments.






	 





	 




	




	 






	M & E charge

	- A daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume. This charge is deducted from the variable investment options. It
	does not apply to the fixed investment option. The current charge is at an effective annual rate of .60% of the value of the assets in each variable investment option. We guarantee that this charge will never exceed an effective annual rate of .60%.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Optional insurance benefits charges

	- An additional Required Premium must be paid if you elect to purchase any additional insurance benefit that
	is added to the policy by means of a rider.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Premium recalculation charge

	- When we perform any recalculation as described in the subsection titled Premium recalculation, we
	deduct a one-time charge in the amount described in that subsection.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Administrative surrender charge

	- A charge we deduct if the policy lapses or is surrendered in the first 9 policy years. We deduct this charge
	to compensate us for administrative expenses that we would otherwise not recover in the event of early lapse or surrender. The amount of the charge depends upon the policy year in which lapse or surrender occurs and the policys Guaranteed
	Death Benefit at that time. The maximum charge is $5 per $1,000 of the policys Guaranteed Death benefit in policy years 1 through 6, $4 per $1,000 in policy years 7 and 8 and $3 per $1,000 in policy year 9. For insured persons age 24 or less
	at issue, this charge will never be more than $200 and will be charged only in the first four policy years. Currently a policy with a Guaranteed Death Benefit at time of surrender or lapse of $250,000 or more is not charged. A policy of less than
	$250,000 Guaranteed Death Benefit at time of surrender or lapse is not currently charged if the surrender or lapse is after the fourth policy year and is charged no more than $300 if the surrender or lapse is in the first four policy years. We may
	withdraw or modify these lower current charges at any time.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)

	- A charge we deduct if the policy lapses or is surrendered within the first thirteen policy
	years. A pro-rata portion of the charge is deducted in the event of a decrease in the Sum Insured. We deduct this charge to compensate us for sales expenses that we would otherwise not recover in the event of early lapse or surrender. The CDSC is a
	percentage of the lesser of (a) the total amount of premiums you have actually paid before the date of surrender or lapse and (b) the sum of the base policy premiums due (whether or not actually paid) on or before the date of surrender or
	lapse. (For this purpose base policy premiums are pro-rated through the end of the policy month in which the surrender or lapse occurs).

	The amount of the CDSC is calculated on the basis of the base policy premium for the
	attained age of the insured person at the time the policy is issued. The base policy premium that we use to compute the CDSC is not affected by (1) any recalculation of the type referred to under Premium recalculation, or
	(2) the non-mandatory character of any Required Premium due to Excess Value in the policy on that premiums due date. The CDSC, as reflected in the above table, reaches its maximum at the end of the sixth policy year and is reduced in each
	policy year thereafter until it reaches zero in policy year 14. At issue ages higher than 54, the maximum is reached at an earlier policy year and may be reduced to zero over a shorter number of years.



	 





	 




	




	 






	Partial withdrawal charge

	- A charge of $20 for each partial withdrawal of Excess Value to compensate us for the administrative expenses of
	processing the withdrawal.







	Loan interest rate




	The maximum loan interest charged on any loan is shown in the Fee Tables and described under Policy loans in this prospectus.







	Additional information about how certain policy charges work







	Sales expenses and related charges




	The sales charges (i.e., the premium sales charge and
	the CDSC) help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies (see Description of Charges at the Policy Level). The amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year. We
	expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policy. To the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses, the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources, including gains from the charge for mortality and
	expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies, or from our general assets. Similarly, administrative expenses not fully recovered by the issue charge and the maintenance charge may also be recovered from such other sources.






	Effect of premium payment pattern




	You may structure the timing and amount of premium payments to minimize the sales charges, although doing so involves certain risks. Paying more than one Required Premium in any policy year could reduce
	your total sales charges. For example, if you paid a Required Premium of $1,000 in each of the first two policy years, you would pay total premium sales charges of $100. If instead you paid $2,000 (i.e., two times the Required Premium amount) in the
	first policy year, you would pay total premium sales charges of only $50. Accelerating the payment of Required Premiums to earlier policy years could result in a larger CDSC and/or cause aggregate premiums paid to exceed the policys 7-pay
	premium limit and, as a result, cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract, with adverse tax consequences to you upon receipt of policy distributions (see Tax consequences). On the other hand, to pay less than the amount of
	Required Premiums by their due dates runs the risk that the policy will lapse, resulting in loss of coverage and additional charges.






	Method of deduction




	We deduct the monthly charges described in the Fee Tables section and any CDSC from your
	policys investment options in proportion to the amount of account value you have in each. For each month that we cannot deduct any charge because of insufficient account value, the uncollected charges will accumulate and be deducted when and
	if sufficient account value becomes available.




	 




	29







	Table of Contents




	The insurance under the policy continues in full force during any grace period but, if the
	insured person dies during the policy grace period, the amount of unpaid monthly charges is deducted from the death benefit otherwise payable.






	Reduced charges for eligible classes




	The charges otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to policies issued to a
	class of associated individuals or to a trustee, employer or similar entity where we anticipate that the sales to the members of the class will result in lower than normal sales or administrative expenses, lower taxes or lower risks to us. We will
	make these reductions in accordance with our rules in effect at the time of the application for a policy. The factors we consider in determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges, and the level of the reduction, are as
	follows: the nature of the association and its organizational framework; the method by which sales will be made to the members of the class; the facility with which premiums will be collected from the associated individuals and the
	associations capabilities with respect to administrative tasks; the anticipated lapse and surrender rates of the policies; the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has been in existence; and any other such
	circumstances which result in a reduction in sales or administrative expenses, lower taxes or lower risks. Any reduction in charges will be reasonable and will apply uniformly to all prospective policy purchasers in the class and will not unfairly
	discriminate against any owner.







	Other charges we could impose in the future





	Except for the DAC tax charge, we currently make no charge for our Federal income taxes. However, if we incur, or expect to incur, income
	taxes attributable to any subaccount of the Account or this class of policies in future years, we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes. Any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options. However, we expect
	that no such charge will be necessary.




	We also reserve the right to increase the premium tax charge and the DAC tax charge in
	order to correspond, respectively, with changes in the state premium tax levels or in the Federal income tax treatment of the deferred acquisition costs for this type of policy.




	Under current laws, we may incur state and local taxes (in addition to premium taxes) in several states. At present, these taxes are not
	significant. If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, we may make charges for such taxes.







	Description of charges at the fund level





	The funds must pay investment management
	fees and other operating expenses. These fees and expenses (shown in the Fee Tables section) are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund. Therefore, they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable
	investment options you select. Expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy, and those expenses may vary from year to year.







	Other policy benefits, rights and limitations








	Optional benefit riders you can add





	When you apply for a policy, you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available. Availability
	of any rider, the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state. Our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and, in some cases, the configuration of the actual rider benefits. Each rider contains specific details
	that you should review before you decide to choose the rider. Charges for most riders will be deducted from the policys account value. We may change these charges (or the rates that determine them), but not above any applicable maximum amount
	stated in the Policy Specifications page of your policy. We may add to, delete from or modify the following list of optional benefit riders:



	 





	 




	




	 






	Insured or Spouse YRT Rider

	- This rider provides a level or decreasing amount of term insurance on the life of the insured person or the
	insured persons spouse. The benefit is payable if the person insured under the rider dies during the term period. In applying for this rider, you must choose the term period and whether the coverage amount is level or decreasing.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Childrens Insurance Benefit Rider

	- This rider covers children of the insured person at the time of application and children born or
	adopted after the rider is purchased. For coverage to begin on any child, he or she must be more than 14 days old and less than 15 years old. Coverage will continue until the earliest of (i) termination of the rider upon request,
	(ii) lapse of the policy, (iii) the insured persons 65th birthday, (iv) election to convert to permanent coverage







	 




	30







	Table of Contents






	 





	on the childs 18th birthday, or (v) the childs 22nd birthday. Since we dont know which children are covered at any point in time, it is up to you to terminate the rider if
	it no longer suits your needs.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Accidental Death Benefit Rider

	- This rider provides for an additional insurance benefit if the insured persons death is due to accidental
	causes between the policy anniversaries nearest the insured persons 5th and 70th birthdays.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Disability Payment of Premium Rider

	- This rider provides its benefit during the total disability (as defined in the rider) of the insured
	person. The benefit continues until the earlier of (i) the policy anniversary nearest the insured persons 65th birthday or (ii) the cessation of total disability. The monthly benefit is equal to one-twelfth of the policys
	annual Required Premium.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Applicant Payment of Premium Rider

	- This rider provides its benefit upon the death of the applicant for the policy or during the total
	disability (as defined in the rider) of the applicant. The benefit continues until the earlier of (i) the policy anniversary nearest the insured persons 22nd birthday or (ii) the cessation of total disability. The monthly benefit is
	equal to one-twelfth of the policys annual Required Premium.










	Variations in policy terms





	Insurance laws and regulations apply to us in every state in which our policies are sold. As a result, terms and
	conditions of your insurance coverage may vary depending on where you purchase a policy. We disclose all material variations in this prospectus.




	We may vary the charges and other terms of our policies where special circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses, mortality risks or other risks that are different from those normally
	associated with the policies. These include the type of variations discussed under Reduced charges for eligible classes. No variation in any charge will exceed any maximum stated in this prospectus with respect to that charge.




	Any variation discussed above will be made only in accordance with uniform rules that we adopt and that we apply fairly to
	our customers.







	Procedures for issuance of a policy





	Generally, the policy is available with a minimum Guaranteed Death Benefit at issue of $50,000. At the time of issue, the insured person
	must have an attained age of 75 or less. All insured persons must meet certain health and other insurance risk criteria called underwriting standards.




	Policies issued in Montana or in connection with certain employee plans will not directly reflect the sex of the insured person in either the premium rates or the charges or values under the policy.






	Commencement of insurance coverage




	After you apply for a policy, it can sometimes take up to several weeks for us to gather and evaluate all the information we need to decide whether to issue a policy to you and, if so, what the insured
	persons risk classification should be. After we approve an application for a policy and assign an appropriate insurance rate class, we will prepare the policy for delivery. We will not pay a death benefit under a policy unless the policy is in
	effect when the insured person dies (except for the circumstances described under Temporary coverage prior to policy delivery below).




	The policy will take effect only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The policy is delivered to and received by the applicant.






	 





	 




	




	 





	At least the first Required Premium is received by us.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Each insured person is living and still meets our criteria for issuing insurance.







	If all of the above conditions are satisfied, the policy will take effect on the date shown in the policy as the date of issue.
	That is the date on which we begin to deduct monthly charges. Policy months, policy years and policy anniversaries are all measured from the date of issue.






	Backdating




	In order to preserve a younger age at issue for the insured person, we can
	designate a date of issue that is up to 60 days earlier than the date that would otherwise apply. This is referred to as backdating and is allowed under state insurance laws.




	 




	31







	Table of Contents




	Backdating can also be used in certain corporate-owned life insurance cases involving multiple policies to
	retain a common monthly deduction date.




	The conditions for coverage described above under Commencement of insurance
	coverage must still be satisfied, but in a backdating situation the policy always takes effect retroactively. Backdating results in a lower insurance charge (if it is used to preserve the insured persons younger age at issue), but
	monthly charges begin earlier than would otherwise be the case. Those monthly charges will be deducted as soon as we receive premiums sufficient to pay them.






	Temporary coverage prior to policy delivery




	If a specified amount of premium is paid with
	the application for a policy and other conditions are met, we will provide temporary term life insurance coverage on the insured person for a period prior to the time coverage under the policy takes effect. Such temporary term coverage will be
	subject to the terms and conditions described in the application for the policy, including limits on amount and duration of coverage.






	Monthly deduction dates




	Each charge that we deduct monthly is assessed against your account value or the subaccounts at
	the close of business on the date of issue and at the close of the first business day in each subsequent policy month.







	Changes that we can make as to your policy





	We reserve the right to make any changes
	in the policy necessary to ensure the policy is within the definition of life insurance under the Federal tax laws and is in compliance with any changes in Federal or state tax laws.




	In our policies, we reserve the right to make certain changes if they would serve the best interests of policy owners or would be
	appropriate in carrying out the purposes of the policies. Such changes include those listed below.



	 





	 




	




	 





	Changes necessary to comply with or obtain or continue exemptions under the Federal securities laws






	 





	 




	




	 





	Combining or removing investment options






	 





	 




	




	 





	Changes in the form of organization of any separate account







	Any such changes will be made only to the extent permitted by applicable laws and only in the manner permitted by such laws. When required
	by law, we will obtain your approval of the changes and the approval of any appropriate regulatory authority.







	The owner of
	the policy





	Who owns the policy? Thats up to the person who applies for the policy. The owner of the policy is the
	person who can exercise most of the rights under the policy, such as the right to choose the investment options or the right to surrender the policy. In many cases, the person buying the policy is also the person who will be the owner. However, the
	application for a policy can name another person or entity (such as a trust) as owner. Wherever the term you appears in this prospectus, weve assumed that the reader is the person who has the right or privilege being discussed.
	There may be tax consequences if the owner and the insured person are different, so you should discuss this issue with your tax adviser. While the insured person is alive, you will have a number of options under the policy. These options include
	those listed below.



	 





	 




	




	 





	Determine when and how much you invest in the various investment options

	




	 





	Choose the form in which we will pay out the death benefit or other proceeds







	It is possible to name so-called joint owners of the policy. If more than one person owns a policy, all owners must join in most
	requests to exercise rights under the policy.

	Policy cancellation right





	You have the right to cancel your policy within the latest of the following periods:



	 





	 




	




	 





	10 days after you receive it (this period may be longer in some states);






	 





	 




	




	 





	10 days after mailing by John Hancock USA of the Notice of Withdrawal Right; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	45 days after the date Part A of the application has been completed.







	This is often referred to as the free look period. During this period, your premiums will be allocated as described under
	Processing premium payments in this prospectus. To cancel your policy, simply deliver or mail the policy to us at one of the addresses shown on the back cover, or to the John Hancock USA representative who delivered the policy to you.




	In most states, you will receive a refund of any premiums youve paid. In some states, the refund will be your account
	value on the date of cancellation plus all charges deducted by John Hancock USA prior to that date. The date of cancellation will be the date of such mailing or delivery.







	Reports that you will receive





	At least annually, we will
	send you a statement setting forth at least the following information as of the end of the most recent reporting period: the Guaranteed Death Benefit, the account value, the portion of the account value in each investment option, the surrender
	value, premiums received and charges deducted from premiums since the last report, and any outstanding policy loan (and interest charged for the preceding policy year). Moreover, you also will receive confirmations of transfers among investment
	options, policy loans, partial withdrawals and certain other policy transactions. Premium payments not in response to a billing notice are unscheduled and will be separately confirmed. Therefore, if you make a premium payment that
	differs by more than $25 from that billed, you will receive a separate confirmation of that premium payment.




	Semi-annually we
	will send you a report containing the financial statements of the Series Fund, including a list of securities held in each fund.







	Assigning your policy





	You may assign your rights in the policy to someone else as collateral for a loan or for some
	other reason. Assignments do not require the consent of any revocable beneficiary. A copy of the assignment must be forwarded to us. We are not responsible for any payment we make or any action we take before we receive notice of the assignment in
	good order. Nor are we responsible for the validity of the assignment. An absolute assignment is a change of ownership. All collateral assignees of record must consent to any full surrender, partial withdrawal or loan from the policy.







	When we pay policy proceeds







	General




	We will ordinarily pay any death benefit, withdrawal, surrender value or loan within 7 days after we receive the
	last required form or request (and, with respect to the death benefit, any other documentation that may be required). As permitted by state law and our current administrative procedures, death claim proceeds may be placed into an interest-bearing
	John Hancock USA retained asset account in the beneficiarys name. We will provide the beneficiary with a checkbook, so checks may be written for all or a part of the proceeds. The retained asset account is part of our general account and is
	subject to the claims of our creditors. It is not a bank account and it is not insured by the FDIC. We may receive a benefit from managing proceeds held in a retained asset account. Please contact our Service Office for more information.






	Delay to challenge coverage




	We may challenge the validity of your insurance policy based on any material misstatements made to us in the application for the policy. We cannot make such a challenge, however, beyond certain time
	limits that are specified in the policy.

	Table of Contents






	Delay for check clearance




	We reserve the right to defer payment of that portion of your account value that is attributable to a premium payment made by check for a
	reasonable period of time (not to exceed 15 days) to allow the check to clear the banking system. We will not delay payment longer than necessary for us to verify a check has cleared the banking system.






	Delay of separate account proceeds




	We reserve the right to defer payment of any death benefit, loan or other distribution that is derived from a variable investment option if (1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than
	customary weekend and holiday closings) or trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (2) an emergency exists, as determined by the SEC, as a result of which disposal of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
	reasonably practicable to fairly determine the account value; or (3) the SEC by order permits the delay for the protection of owners. Transfers and allocations of account value among the investment options may also be postponed under these
	circumstances. If we need to defer calculation of separate account values for any of the foregoing reasons, all delayed transactions will be processed at the next values that we do compute.






	Delay of general account surrender proceeds




	State laws allow us to defer payment of any portion of the surrender value derived from the fixed investment option for up to 6 months. These laws were enacted many years ago to help insurance companies
	in the event of a liquidity crisis.







	How do you communicate with us?







	General rules




	You
	should mail or express all checks and money orders for premium payments and loan repayments to our Service Office at the appropriate address shown on the back cover.

	You should mail or express all written requests to our Service Office at the appropriate address shown on the back cover. You should also
	send notice of the insured persons death and related documentation to our Service Office. We dont consider that weve received any communication until such time as it has arrived at the proper place and in the proper and
	complete form.




	We have special forms that should be used for a number of the requests mentioned above. You can obtain these
	forms from our Service Office or your John Hancock USA representative. Each communication to us must include your name, your policy number and the name of the insured person. We cannot process any request that doesnt include this required
	information. Any communication that arrives after the close of our business day, or on a day that is not a business day, will be considered received by us on the next following business day. Our business day currently closes at 4:00 p.m.
	Eastern Time, but special circumstances (such as suspension of trading on a major exchange) may dictate an earlier closing time.

	Telephone and facsimile transactions




	If you complete a special authorization form, you can request loans, transfers among investment options and changes of allocation among
	investment options simply by telephoning us at 1-800-732-5543 or by faxing us at 617-572-1571. Any fax request should include your name, daytime telephone number, policy number and, in the case of transfers and changes of allocation, the names of
	the investment options involved. We will honor telephone instructions from anyone who provides the correct identifying information, so there is a risk of loss to you if this service is used by an unauthorized person. However, you will receive
	written confirmation of all telephone transactions. There is also a risk that you will be unable to place your request due to equipment malfunction or heavy phone line usage. If this occurs, you should submit your request in writing.




	If you authorize telephone transactions, you will be liable for any loss, expense or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent
	telephone instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine, unless such loss, expense or cost is the result of our mistake or negligence. We employ procedures which provide safeguards against the execution of unauthorized transactions, and
	which are reasonably designed to confirm that instructions received by telephone are genuine. These procedures include requiring personal identification, tape recording calls, and providing written confirmation to the owner. If we do not employ
	reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone are genuine, we may be liable for any loss due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.





	As stated earlier in this prospectus, the policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among investment
	options.

	For reasons such as that, we have imposed restrictions on transfers. However, we also reserve the right to change our telephone and facsimile transaction policies or procedures at any time. Moreover, we also reserve the right to suspend
	or terminate the privilege altogether with respect to any owners who we feel are abusing the privilege to the detriment of other owners.







	Distribution of policies





	John Hancock Distributors LLC (JH Distributors), a Delaware limited liability
	company affiliated with us, is the principal distributor and underwriter of the securities offered through this prospectus and of other annuity and life insurance products we and our affiliates offer. JH Distributors also acts as the principal
	underwriter of the Trust, whose securities are used to fund certain investment accounts under the policies and under other annuity and life insurance products we offer.




	JH Distributors principal address is 200 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Canada M4W 1E5 and it also maintains offices with us at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116. JH Distributors is a
	broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act) and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).




	We offer the policies for sale through individuals who are licensed as insurance agents and who are registered representatives of
	broker-dealers that have entered into selling agreements with JH Distributors. These broker-dealers may include our affiliate Signator Investors, Inc. In addition, we, either directly or through JH Distributors, have entered into agreements with
	other financial intermediaries that provide marketing, sales support and certain administrative services to help promote the policies (financial intermediaries). In a limited number of cases, we have entered into loans, leases or other
	financial agreements with these broker-dealers or financial intermediaries or their affiliates.







	Compensation





	The broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries that distribute or support the marketing of our policies may be
	compensated by means of various compensation and revenue sharing arrangements. A general description of these arrangements is set out below under Standard compensation and Additional compensation and revenue sharing. These
	arrangements may differ between firms, and not all broker-dealers or financial intermediaries will receive the same compensation and revenue sharing benefits for distributing our policies. Also, a broker-dealer may receive more or less compensation
	or other benefits for the promotion and sale of our policy than it would expect to receive from another issuer.




	Under their
	own arrangements, broker-dealers determine how much of any amounts received from us is to be paid to their registered representatives. Our affiliated broker-dealer may pay its registered representatives additional compensation and benefits, such as
	bonus payments, expense payments, health and retirement benefits or the waiver of overhead costs or expenses in connection with the sale of the policies that they would not receive in connection with the sale of policies issued by unaffiliated
	companies.




	 




	35







	Table of Contents




	Policy owners do not pay any compensation or revenue sharing benefits directly. These
	payments are made from JH Distributors and our own revenues, profits or retained earnings, which may be derived from a number of sources, such as fees received from an underlying funds distribution plan (12b-1 fees), the fees
	and charges imposed under the policy and other sources.




	You should contact your registered representative for more
	information on compensation arrangements in connection with your purchase of a policy. We provide additional information on special compensation or reimbursement arrangements involving broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries in the
	Statement of Additional Information, which is available upon request.





	Standard compensation.

	JH Distributors pays
	compensation to broker-dealers for the promotion and sale of the policies, and for providing ongoing service in relation to policies that have already been purchased. We may also pay a limited number of broker-dealers commissions or overrides to
	wholesale the policies; that is, to provide marketing support and training services to the broker-dealer firms that do the actual selling.




	The compensation JH Distributors pays to broker-dealers may vary depending on the selling agreement. The compensation paid is not expected to exceed 117.5% of the base policy premiums paid in the first
	policy year, 13% of such premiums paid in the second through fourth policy years, and 3% of such premium paid in each policy year thereafter. The maximum commission on any premium paid in excess of such policy premium in any policy year is 4%. This
	compensation schedule is exclusive of additional compensation and revenue sharing and inclusive of overrides and expense allowances paid to broker-dealers for sale of the policies (not including riders).





	Additional compensation and revenue sharing.

	To the extent permitted by SEC and FINRA rules and other applicable laws and
	regulations, we may enter into special compensation or reimbursement arrangements (revenue sharing), either directly or through JH Distributors, with selected broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries. In consideration of these
	arrangements, a firm may feature our policy in its sales system, give us preferential access to sales staff, or allow JH Distributors or its affiliates to participate in conferences, seminars or other programs attended by the firms sales
	force. We hope to benefit from these revenue sharing and other arrangements through increased sales of our policies.




	Selling
	broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries may receive, directly or indirectly, additional payments in the form of cash, other compensation or reimbursement. These additional compensation or reimbursement arrangements may include, for
	example, payments in connection with the firms due diligence examination of the policies, payments for providing conferences or seminars, sales or training programs for invited registered representatives and other employees,
	payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred by registered representatives and other employees for such seminars or training programs, seminars for the public or client seminars, advertising and sales campaigns regarding the policies,
	payments to assist a firm in connection with its systems, operations and marketing expenses and/or other events or activities sponsored by the firms. We may contribute to, as well as sponsor, various educational programs, sales promotions, and/or
	other contests in which participating firms and their sales persons may receive gifts and prizes such as merchandise, cash or other rewards as may be permitted under FINRA rules and other applicable laws and regulations.







	Tax considerations





	This description of Federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is neither exhaustive nor authoritative. It was written to support the promotion of our products. It does not constitute legal or tax advice, and it is not
	intended to be used and cannot be used to avoid any penalties that may be imposed on you. Tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances, and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser. Federal, state
	and local tax laws, regulations and interpretations can change from time to time. As a result, the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered, in some cases retroactively. The policy may be used in various arrangements, including
	non- qualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, split dollar insurance plans, executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and
	circumstances of each individual arrangement. Therefore, if the value of using the policy in any such arrangement depends in part on the tax consequences, a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advice.







	General





	We
	are taxed as a life insurance company. Under current tax law rules, we include the investment income (exclusive of capital gains) of the Separate Account in our taxable income and take deductions for investment income credited to our policy
	holder reserves. We are also required to capitalize and amortize certain costs instead of deducting those costs when




	 




	36







	Table of Contents




	they are incurred. We do not currently charge the Separate Account for any resulting income tax costs, other than a DAC tax charge we may impose against the Separate Account to
	compensate us for the finance costs attributable to the acceleration of our income tax liabilities by reason of a DAC tax adjustment. We also claim certain tax credits or deductions relating to foreign taxes paid and dividends received
	by the series funds. These benefits can be material. We do not pass these benefits through to the Separate Account, principally because: (i) the deductions and credits are allowed to us and not the policy owners under applicable tax law; and
	(ii) the deductions and credits do not represent investment return on the Separate Account assets that are passed through to policy owners.




	The policies permit us to deduct a charge for any taxes we incur that are attributable to the operation or existence of the policies or the Separate Account. Currently, we do not anticipate making any
	specific charge for such taxes other than any DAC tax charge and premium taxes. If the level of the current taxes increases, however, or is expected to increase in the future, we reserve the right to make a charge in the future.







	Death benefit proceeds and other policy distributions





	Generally, death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax. Earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to
	you. If we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal, all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax. However certain
	distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first 15 years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part. Amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you.




	However, some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract. This can happen if youve paid
	premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws. Additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind, including loans (see 7-pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below).




	We expect the policy to receive the same Federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies.
	Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code defines a life insurance contract for Federal tax purposes. For a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract, it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium
	test. These tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy. We will monitor compliance with these standards. If we determine that a policy does not satisfy section 7702, we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable
	to bring it into compliance with section 7702.




	If the policy complies with section 7702, the death benefit proceeds under the
	policy ordinarily should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section 101 of the Internal Revenue Code.




	Increases in account value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to Federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions. In general, unless the policy is a modified
	endowment contract, the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy. An exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that
	reduces benefits under the policy in the first 15 years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner. Changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals, death benefit option changes, and distributions
	required to keep the policy in compliance with section 7702. For purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction. A cash distribution that
	reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part (to the extent of any gain in the policy) under rules prescribed in section 7702. The taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section 7702(f)(7). Any taxable distribution will be
	ordinary income to the owner (rather than capital gain).




	Distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon
	surrender or partial withdrawals. You may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership.




	It is possible that, despite our monitoring, a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section 7702 of the Internal
	Revenue Code. This could happen, for example, if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts, or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements
	of the Internal Revenue Code. If this were to occur, you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods.




	Tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under Federal, state and local estate, inheritance, gift and other tax laws will
	depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary. If the person insured by the policy is also its




	 




	37







	Table of Contents




	owner, either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocable trust, the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the Federal estate tax. If the owner is
	not the person insured, the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death. Even if ownership has been transferred, the death proceeds or the policy value may be includible in the former owners estate
	if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy. You should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences.




	Because there may be unfavorable tax consequences (including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income tax-free treatment for
	any death benefit payable to the beneficiary), you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests.







	Policy loans





	We expect that, except as noted below (see
	7-pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status), loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner. However, if the policy terminates
	for any reason other than the payment of the death benefit, the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination. This could result in a
	considerable tax bill. Under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans, you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums required to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the
	lapse to occur.







	Diversification rules and ownership of the Account





	Your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the Account follows certain rules requiring
	diversification of investments underlying the policy. In addition, the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets.




	In certain circumstances, the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner, for Federal income tax purposes, of the
	assets of the separate account used to support the policy. In those circumstances, income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
	stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets, such as the ability to exercise investment control over the
	assets. A Treasury Decision issued in 1986 stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which Policyholders may direct their investments to particular sub-accounts of a separate account without
	being treated as owners of the underlying assets. As of the date of this prospectus, no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued. In Rev. Rul. 2003-91, however, the IRS ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner
	of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts.




	The ownership rights under your policy are similar to, but different in certain respects from, those described in IRS rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate
	account assets. Since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings, it is

	possible

	that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of
	the Account.




	We do not know what future Treasury Department regulations or other guidance may require. We cannot guarantee
	that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses, or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies. We have reserved the right to modify your policy
	if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the Account, but we are under no obligation to do so.







	7-pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status





	At the time of policy issuance, we will determine whether the Planned Premium schedule will exceed the 7-pay limit discussed below. If so, our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that
	fact.




	The 7-pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed
	policy to be fully paid-up after the payment of 7 equal annual premiums. Paid-up means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity, based on certain prescribed assumptions. If
	the total premiums paid




	 




	38







	Table of Contents




	at any time during the first 7 policy years exceed the 7-pay limit, the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract, which can have adverse tax consequences.




	Policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules:



	 





	 




	




	 





	First, all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess (if any) of the
	policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time. If you own any other modified endowment contracts issued to you in the same calendar year by the same insurance company or its affiliates, their values
	will be combined with the value of the policy from which you take the withdrawal for purposes of determining how much of the withdrawal is taxable as ordinary income.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Second, loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the
	policy and taxed accordingly. Past-due loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Third, a 10% additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution (including distributions on surrender) from, or loan taken from or
	secured by, such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan:






	 





	 




	




	 





	is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age 59


	 1



	/


	2


	;







	 





	 




	




	 





	is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the policy owner or the joint lives (or joint life
	expectancies) of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary.







	These exceptions to the 10%
	additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual.




	Furthermore, any time there is a
	material change in a policy, the policy will begin a new 7-pay testing period as if it were a newly-issued policy. The material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex. In general,
	however, the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change, the policy value at the time of the change,
	and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs.




	Moreover, if there is a reduction in benefits under a policy (such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits) during a 7-pay testing period, the 7-pay limit will generally be recalculated
	based on the reduced benefits and the policy will be re-tested from the beginning of the 7-pay testing period using the lower limit. If the premiums paid to date at any point during the 7-pay testing period are greater than the recalculated 7-pay
	limit, the policy will become a modified endowment contract.




	If your policy is issued as a result of a section 1035 exchange,
	it may be considered to be a modified endowment contract if the death benefit under the new policy is smaller than the death benefit under the exchanged policy, or if you reduce coverage in your new policy after it is issued. Therefore, if you
	desire to reduce the face amount as part of a 1035 exchange, a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advice.




	All
	modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer (or its affiliates) to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules. A policy
	received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract. You should consult your tax adviser if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the 7-pay limit on your policy.







	Corporate and H.R. 10 retirement plans





	The policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. If so, the Internal Revenue Code
	provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be carefully scrutinized. We are not responsible for compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
	Code.







	Withholding





	To the extent that policy distributions to you are taxable, they are generally subject to withholding for your Federal income tax liability. However if you reside in the United States, you can generally
	choose not to have tax withheld from distributions.
