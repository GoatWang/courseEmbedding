WHAT OUR CLIENTS & PARTNERS SAY



Pfaller

	T2 Biosystems has done what many said could not be done. Its T2MR technology generates accurate, rapid results using direct sample analysis of whole blood without relying on blood culture. The T2Candida Panel represents how T2MR is the next breakthrough in medical diagnostics, and it has significant potential to save lives and reduce healthcare costs.


Michael Pfaller, MD, Chief Medical Officer, T2 Biosystems, Lexington, MA, Professor Emeritus, University of Iowa College of Medicine & College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA







Clancy

	What we need is a test that is 90% sensitive and 90% specific. That’s the test that makes a difference. If you’re at 90/90 then the negative predictive value is exceptional in virtually every population you use it in...that’s really clinically the most meaningful performance that we can achieve.


Cornelius J. Clancy, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Director, Mycology Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA







Mylonakis

The ability to determine the presence or absence of Candida within hours – compared to days – is paradigm changing for patients at risk for these infections.


Eleftherios Mylonakis, MD, PhD, FIDSA, Chief, Division of Infectious Diseases, Rhode Island Hospital and The Miriam Hospital and Dean's Professor of Medical Science, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI







Canon US Life Sciences

	We believe combining our collective expertise with T2 Biosystems' proprietary T2MR platform may enable us to develop a fully differentiated diagnostic panel for the detection of Lyme disease, an area of critical need where delays in providing appropriate treatment to patients can result in significant morbidity and unnecessary costs.


Akiko Tanaka, President and CEO of Canon U.S. Life Sciences

	John McDonough






	 




	Thanks, Tucker. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call.




	 




	2016 proved to be a transformative year for T2  operationally, strategically, and financially. We made significant progress against our priorities throughout the year  growing our customer base, expanding our partnership pipeline and highlighting the power of our technology through customer success stories and real-world data. We are well on our way towards demonstrating the power of the T2 Technology to improve patient health and deliver strong economic returns to healthcare institutions.




	 




	We exited the year with strong momentum  led by a solid performance in the fourth quarter  and we expect that momentum to continue in 2017, which I will cover further in a bit. But first, let me walk you through some of the operational and strategic highlights from the quarter and the year.




	 












	 




	In the fourth quarter, we secured commitments that will provide us access to an estimated 100,000 additional patients annually, considered to be at high risk for sepsis infections. This number represents 18 new hospitals in the U.S. and Europe  four contracts, representing 14 hospitals in the U.S., and four in Europe. This result also represents 67% of our target of 150,000 new high-risk patients by September 30, 2017. As a result of this strong performance, today we are increasing that target to 200,000 high-risk patients over the same period.




	 




	Our performance in Europe in 2016 exceeded our expectations. Our goal was to enter four European markets, and by the end of the year, we expanded our European presence to eight countries via contracts with international distributors. Europe will continue to be a key focus in 2017 as we add more hospitals to our customer base, and as those hospitals roll-out and commence testing of patients.




	 




	At the end of 2016, the worldwide installed base of hospitals with access to the T2Dx® Instrument grew to 143 hospitals, representing an estimated 445,000 symptomatic patients annually who are considered to be at high risk of sepsis infections  an approximate 95% percent year-over-year increase in high-risk patients.




	 




	Importantly, during the fourth quarter, we continued to make strong progress with the T2Bacteria program and we remain on-track for completing the clinical trial and filing for market clearance with the FDA by mid-2017.




	 




	We recently completed a detailed market research survey conducted by an independent market research firm that assessed the overall market needs in sepsis diagnostics. The research included interviews and surveys of leaders in hospitals labs, infectious disease and hospital administration and in part focused on their views of T2Candida and our product candidate, T2Bacteria.




	 




	We thought it would be helpful to share with you, a few highlights from the research:




	 




	1.


	             

	Lab directors will be over 3-times more likely to recommend adopting the T2 technology with both T2Candida and T2Bacteria  validating our belief that T2Bacteria will be a game-changer for our business;



	 




	2.


	             

	Two thirds of the critical clinical decisions are made in the first 24 hours of when patients are initially tested  demonstrating the critical need for faster and more accurate tests as blood culture results extend beyond the 24-hour period. The ideal time to result is 12 hours and the most important test result is species identification, not susceptibility results. To our knowledge, only the T2 platform can deliver results in the ideal timeframe of 12 hours or less and for that matter, within the first 24-hour timeframe;



	 












	 




	3.


	             

	Infectious Disease doctors are strong supporters of the T2 platform with T2Candida on a standalone basis, and are even more positive when you add T2Bacteria.



	 




	4.


	             

	Economic customer success stories are important in driving market adoption.



	 




	The survey results are consistent with our own experiences in the market and further demonstrate the need for and power of our platform and products.




	 




	Switching to other product pipeline development, we are also making good progress with T2Lyme, and remain on-track to complete pre-clinical studies in 2017 which will lead to an FDA clinical trial in 2018.




	 




	We recently received issuance of a key patent related to T2MR in the field of hemostasis. This patent covers the T2MR measurement of multiple factors directly in blood. These new claims, in combination with issued claims from other issued patents demonstrate our innovations and protect the multiple T2MR hemostasis measurements associated with assessing the risk of patients bleeding or clotting.




	 




	In 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet and formed important strategic alliances that position us for long-term sustainable growth:




	 




	·


	                 

	In July, we announced a multi-year agreement will Bayer to provide our T2MR for Bayers research and development efforts and blood coagulation disorders.



	 




	·


	                 

	In September, we announced a $40 million equity investment by Canon U.S.A. that will fund the companys continued growth through the launch of the T2Bacteria Panel.



	 




	·


	                 

	In November, we announced a collaboration with Allergan to develop a novel diagnostic panel to detect Gram-negative bacterial species and antibiotic resistance for patients with serious bacterial infections including infections that lead to sepsis.



	 




	·


	                 

	And in December, we secured a new $50 million debt facility with CRG with an initial draw of $40 million that delays the payment of principal payments for at least 3 years, further improving our capital position.



	 




	We enter 2017 with the financial resources and important partnerships that not only drive new opportunities but also represent important third-party endorsements of our technology and T2s strategic direction. During the quarter we continued to expand our partnership pipeline, and while we will remain selective in our approach, we are hopeful to expand our partnerships in 2017.




	 




	Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, during the year, the value of our products were demonstrated at customer sites throughout the US and Europe. Four of our




	 












	 




	customers presented or published data at industry conferences from their use of T2Candida that highlight the patient and economic impact of testing patients.




	 




	The most notable one came from the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, which presented a statistically significant study reporting approximately $2 million in savings through the implementation of the T2Candida technology. These savings were realized by significant reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay for patients, along with a reduction in the use of antifungal drugs.




	 




	Other customers included Riverside Hospital in California, Huntsville Hospital in Alabama, and the Lee Memorial Health Systems in Florida  all of whom demonstrated outstanding economic returns for their respective hospitals.




	 




	On that note, I would now like to turn the call over briefly to Tom Lowery, Chief Scientific Officer, to provide some further color on successes that customers have had as a result of our technology. Tom?




	 






	Tom Lowery






	 




	Thanks John.




	 




	We continue to see case studies where T2Candida is detecting tissue based infections, also known as Deep-Seated Candidiasis, where blood culture is missing these infections.




	 




	Just to remind you, in our original pivotal study we had one case that was positive with T2Candida, but negative for over 12 blood cultures. In this patient, 7 days after the T2Candida positive result, an intra-abdominal abscess was discovered that was subsequently sampled by surgically obtained tissue culture and confirmed to be the same Candida species that was detected days earlier by T2Candida. We now know this was the first of many such cases.




	 




	To date, there have been dozens of clinical cases that we are aware of where blood culture was negative, T2Candida was positive and confirmed via other microbiological methods.




	 




	In Europe, for example, a hospital reported that T2Candida identified four patients that were blood culture negative, but had confirmed lung infections from the same species of Candida using culture from a bronchial lavage. Another example is from a large US hospital where multiple cancer patients suffered from invasive intra-abdominal Candida infections that were missed by blood culture, but identified by T2Candida and confirmed by imaging and follow-on microbiology testing.




	 












	 




	Additionally, customers have shared several other patient case studies where blood culture was negative but non-blood culture specimens such as wound swabs and respiratory samples were positive and matched the T2Candida results. The inability of blood culture to detect deep-seated tissue infections and the challenges associated with obtaining high quality tissue samples, swabs, and lung washes for culture are well understood by microbiology directors.




	 




	Its been exciting to hear the enthusiasm from customers that experience cases like these. We expect more cases of deep seated candidiasis will be detected by T2Candida, further demonstrating the ability of the test to help physicians and labs to appropriately manage patients with invasive candidiasis who with blood culture alone are being missed.




	 






	John McDonough






	 




	Thanks Tom. As you can see, our products truly are transformational and these success stories are and will continue to be an important driver going forward in securing our next phase of growth. There have been a lot of developments in the field of sepsis diagnostics, but to our knowledge, all products in the market or coming into the market that detect species or susceptibility require a positive blood culture first. We know the problem of a blood culture taking one to five days to go positive, but the biggest problem may be the 30 to 50% of patients that are positive with infections, but declared negative by blood culture. T2Candida today, and we believe T2Bacteria soon, may detect patients days faster, but may also detect patients that are missed by blood culture. Providing this information to clinicians can be critical in the survival and recovery of patients, and the hospital costs associated with these infections.




	 




	With that, let me turn the call over to Shawn to take you through the quarterly and full-year financial results and our 2017 outlook. Shawn?




	 






	Shawn Lynch






	 




	Thanks John.




	 




	Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $910,000, which consisted of $579,000 of product revenue, compared to $343,000 of product revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015. Results were driven by an increase in T2Candida Panel sales due to increased patient testing across the installed base.




	 




	Total revenue for the full-year was $4.1 million, which consisted of $1.75 of product revenue, compared to $599,000 of product revenue for the full-year of 2015  an




	 












	 




	increase of approximately 191%. Product revenue for the full-year was primarily derived from a combination of instrument and consumable sales.




	 




	Total operating expenses, excluding costs of product revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $11.5 million, compared to $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	Full-year total operating expenses, excluding costs of product revenue, were $48.0 million, compared to $44.5 million for 2015, due to an expansion of commercial activities and continued investments in the product pipeline, including T2Bacteria and T2Lyme.




	 




	We continue to focus on cost control ahead of the T2Bacteria launch, however our operating expenses will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the level of clinical studies we are running.




	 




	The net loss applicable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was $14.4 million, or a $0.47 loss per share, compared to $12.0 million, or a $0.56 loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding.




	 




	The net loss applicable to common shareholders for the full-year of 2016 was $54.7 million, or a $2.10 loss per share, compared to $45.3 million, or a $2.21 loss per share, due to an expansion of commercial activities and the continued investment in our product pipeline.




	 




	We closed the year with a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $73.5 million. This strong position will only be further buoyed by the debt refinancing we executed at the end of the quarter. The agreement positively impacted our cash flow as we secured a minimum of three years of interest-only payments while extending the companys borrowing limit to $40 million with the potential option to draw an additional $10 million and extend the interest-only period further upon the T2Bacteria Panel achieving FDA clearance.




	 




	As we move into 2017, as John stated earlier, we are now targeting an increase in the number of high-risk patients at customer facilities of 200,000 patients, or an additional 100,000 to the number closed in Q4, by the end of the third quarter of 2017 ahead of the launch of T2Bacteria.




	 




	Additionally, we are anticipating higher product revenue in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 from an increase in T2Candida sales due to increased patient testing across the installed base.




	 












	 




	Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 are expected to be between $13.2 million and $13.7 million, of which approximately $1.8 million is non-cash expenses, which are primarily depreciation and stock compensation expenses. We are also forecasting weighted average shares for the first quarter to be 30.6 million and 31 million for the full-year.




	 




	With that, I would like to turn the call back over to John for some closing remarks.




	 






	John McDonough






	 




	Thanks Shawn.




	 




	Our priorities entering 2017 are clear and unchanged, and our square focus is on execution.




	 




	Priority One  continue to expand and gain access to patients at large hospitals and hospital systems in the US and Europe who are at high-risk of sepsis infection. We had previously stated a 12-month goal, through September 30, of adding 150,000 high risk patients and we are taking that number up to 200,000 high risk patients based on our strong performance in the fourth quarter.




	 




	Two  introduce new products to expand current suite of solutions. We are running patient samples at clinical sites and expect to complete the clinical trial for T2Bacteria and file for market clearance with the FDA by mid-2017. We also intend to communicate the results of our clinical study with you, after completion. For our other products in the pipeline, we intend to complete preclinical studies for T2Lyme in 2017, which will lead to an expected FDA clinical trial in 2018 while commencing pre-clinical studies for the Gram Negative Resistance Panel in 2018.




	 




	Three  expand our partnership pipeline to help accelerate our growth profile. In November, we announced our partnership with Allergan, and we are working to grow our pipeline of other partnership opportunities.




	 




	And finally  we expect to see more customer success stories that may continue to demonstrate the power of T2s technology and the impact it is having at healthcare institutions. This will be an important driver of the future success of T2.




	 




	As I have stated before, and continue to believeat the core of T2, we are working to deliver diagnostic products that fundamentally change clinical decisions in a way that




	 












	 




	saves the lives of the patients and delivers a strong economic return to the hospital system.




	 




	Our technology continues to help our customers be at the forefront of the paradigm shift occurring within hospitals with regards to how they approach patient care. We remain committed to and are excited to see the impact of our products on the lives of patients and the economics of hospitals in 2017 and beyond.




	 




	With that Id like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?

	Q&A

	Operator






	 




	Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. I will turn the call back over to John McDonough for closing comments.




	 






	John McDonough






	 




	Thank you for joining us today. The future of T2 is bright and our number one focus for 2017 is on execution.




	 




	If people have additional questions, well certainly be around.




	 




	Thank you all for dialing in.

United States

Employees:41-100Year Founded:2006Industry:Medical Devices and EquipmentCompany Profile:T2 Biosystems, founded in 2006 by renowned scientists from MIT and Mass General Hospital, is an in vitro diagnostic company that has developed an innovative and proprietary technology platform that offers a rapid, sensitive and simple alternative to existing diagnostic methodologies. We are using our T2 Magnetic Resonance platform, or T2MR, to develop a broad set of applications aimed at reducing mortality rates, improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare by helping medical professionals make targeted treatment decisions earlier.  T2MR enables rapid detection of pathogens, biomarkers and other abnormalities in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including whole blood, and can detect cellular targets at limits of detection as low as one colony forming unit per milliliter, or CFU/ml.  Our initial development efforts utilizing T2MR target sepsis and hemostasis, which are areas of significant unmet medical need in which existing therapies could be more effective with improved diagnostics. We have completed a pivotal clinical trial for our T2Dx diagnostic instrument, or T2Dx, and T2 Candida panel, or T2Candida, which have the ability to rapidly identify the five clinically relevant species of Candida, a fungal pathogen known to cause sepsis.  Upon receiving regulatory clearance, we intend to commercialize T2Dx and T2 Candida and our goal is to launch these product candidates commercially in the United States in the first half of 2015.

T2 Biosystems was named to the FierceMedicalDevices "Fierce 15" list in 2012, received the prestigious SBANE award in 2013 and received the Most Promising Company award at the Personalized Medicine World Conference in 2014.

T2Candida Panel



T2Candida Panel 



	Rapidly detect and identify Candida species—no blood culture required


	Today, hospitals like Henry Ford in Michigan and Lee Health System in Florida, which have implemented the T2Candida® Panel, are reducing ICU and hospital lengths of stay, while minimizing the use of unnecessary antifungals, saving millions of dollars each year. T2Candida is the only FDA-cleared sepsis pathogen detection panel requiring no blood culture, delivering faster, easier and more accurate results in 3 to 5 hours from a simple blood draw.1


	Run on the fully automated T2Dx Instrument, the T2Candida Panel identifies the five clinically relevant species of Candida directly from whole blood. This enables physicians to initiate appropriate therapy within hours of the blood draw. This is especially important given that research has shown that the mortality rate for sepsis rises 8% every hour treatment is delayed.2 Today, all other FDA-cleared Candida diagnostics rely on blood culture, which is hampered by a sensitivity of 50% and a lag time of up to 2 to 6 days for species identification or negative result.3 When up to half of infections are missed, even the most accurate blood-culture-reliant diagnostic cannot detect what blood culture missed.


	If you have a patient at risk of sepsis, strongly consider running the T2Candida Panel. It delivers:




			91.1% sensitivity1




			99.4% specificity1  
		



			Limits of detection as low as 1 CFU/mL1




			Species-specific results in an average of 3 to 5 hours directly from whole blood1




			Accuracy even in the presence of antimicrobials
		



	The T2Candida Panel detects the following species of Candida directly from whole blood: C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei and C. glabrata.





	A positive T2Candida Panel result enables clinicians to quickly treat patients with appropriate therapy, reducing costs, adverse outcomes, and patient mortality.4  


	A negative T2Candida Panel result enables clinicians to avoid unnecessary antifungal therapy use, reducing antimicrobial costs, toxicity and resistance.

Our Company



Our Company 



	At T2 Biosystems, our mission is to save lives and improve healthcare by empowering clinicians to effectively treat patients faster than ever before.


	Our proven T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR®) technology is transforming diagnostics by providing accurate and actionable information to doctors when it matters most. Today, T2 tests are improving the quality of care and savings hospitals millions of dollars each year. The FDA-cleared T2Candida® Panel is available in over 130 hospitals and our European presence now includes 10 countries. 


	At T2 Biosystems, we focus on critical unmet needs in healthcare diagnostics, choosing targets based on the prevalence and frequency of ineffective treatment due to shortcomings in current diagnostics. This approach made sepsis, one of the deadliest and the most expensive conditions in hospitals today, a natural first choice. 


	The T2Sepsis Solution™ starts with theT2Candida Panel that runs on the T2Dx® Instrument and can detect the five most clinically relevant species of Candida in 3 to 5 hours—directly from the patient’s blood and without the need for blood culture. The sepsis-causing pathogen Candida has a staggering average mortality rate of approximately 40%.1 Today, hospitals like Henry Ford Health System in Michigan2 and Lee Health System in Florida,3 both of which use T2 products, are reporting that patients are getting on the right therapy—and off unnecessary therapy—much faster. The results are changing healthcare: length of stay for patients, along with healthcare costs, are going down. In addition to expediting patient care: 



		The T2Candida Panel is extremely accurate with a proven sensitivity of over 90%, while blood culture is only 50% in comparison.4,5 
	

		The specificity of T2 panels is over 99%, so doctors can have confidence in a negative result.4 
	

		T2MR technology is now detecting complex conditions that blood culture often misses, such as fungal lung infections. 
	


In cases where doctors had no actionable information on which to base their decisions, T2MR technology is now enabling the lab and physicians to partner to provide more targeted treatment. 


	The rapid and accurate T2 results are critical weapons in the hospital’s fight against antimicrobial resistance: 



		T2 results reduce the overuse of antimicrobial therapies by getting doctors and hospitals specific pathogen identification information faster than ever before. Positive results enable targeted treatment, and negative results may allow physicians to limit or eliminate the use of unnecessary drugs. 
	


This responsible stewardship combats drug resistance and superbugs, helping ensure these crucial treatments are available for generations to come.


	What’s next? The T2Bacteria® Panel


	We are building on our T2MR technology to provide the T2Sepsis Solution to hospitals. Our next panel, T2Bacteria, is undergoing clinical trials and will be submitted to the FDA mid-2017. The T2Bacteria RUO Panel is currently available for Research Use Only (RUO) in the US. In the EU, performance evaluation studies are in progress and the T2Bacteria Panel will be available as a CE marked product in the coming months.


	Thanks to the aggressive efforts of clinicians and hospitals, about 60% of symptomatic patients now receive the appropriate antimicrobial therapy within a 24-hour window. But the limitations of current diagnostic technology leaves about 40% of patients waiting too long for the right diagnosis and treatment. Help is on the way: 



		With T2 tests for Candida and key bacterial species, hospitals will be able to treat 95% of patients appropriately within the first 12 hours of the critical care window. 
	

		Other ongoing development efforts in our pipeline include bacterial resistance panels and a hemostasis diagnostic, as well as Lyme disease panel through a partnership with Canon U.S.A.
	


	Why does it matter that T2 tests can be done from whole blood; that is, without blood culture?


	T2’s no-blood-culture-required approach to sepsis pathogen detection means hospitals get results in hours, not days. When research tells us the mortality rate for sepsis rises by 8% every hour,6 waiting days for results is just not good enough.


	And because T2 products do not require the growth of cells like blood culture tests, over 90% of infections are detected—instead of the 50% to 65% detection rate for blood culture.7 Hospitals know that delivering the appropriate care for sepsis in less than 24 hours, and ideally 12 hours, is critical for their patients. T2 has the only FDA-cleared and CE marked products that can do that.  


	How does the technology behind the T2 test work?


	T2 tests are powered by our proprietary T2MR technology platform. T2MR combines proven magnetic resonance with innovative nanotechnology to accurately identify pathogens in whole blood faster and easier than blood-culture-based diagnostics. 



		T2MR works by measuring how water molecules react in the presence of magnetic fields, utilizing the same magnetic-resonance-based approach found in MRI, but on a miniaturized scale. 
	

		Over 200 studies published in peer-reviewed journals have featured T2MR technology in a breadth of applications. 
	

		With limits of detection as low as 1 CFU/mL, we believe T2MR technology will drive the next generation of in vitro diagnostics.
	


	T2 Biosystems’ use of T2MR technology to help get patients on the right treatment faster has led to multiple recognitions including:



		Receiving the prestigious Prix Galien USA Best Medical Technology award in 2015. 
	

		Being named among the 50 Smartest Companies of 2016 by MIT Technology Review.
	

		Recognition of CEO John McDonough as #8 Most Creative Person by Fast Company in 2016. 
	


	In addition, various industry leaders continue to validate the game-changing power of T2MR technology by entering into strategic alliances with T2 Biosystems. In 2016, T2 Biosystems announced partnerships with Canon U.S.A., Allergan and Bayer.

T2 Biosystems Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO) Inches Closer To T2Bacetria Panel Europe Launch After CE Mark 

 

0100T2 Biosystems Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO)
Shares of T2 Biosystems Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO) rallied by 12.41% as investors reacted to news the company had received a CE mark for its T2Bacteria Panel. The CE mark paves way for the company to market and sell the product in all the countries within the European Union. The product will now be available as part of the T2Sepsis solution as of the third quarter.
Monday’s rally pushed the stock above this month’s lows of $2.50 a share. It awaits to be seen if the momentum will be strong enough to reverse a strong downtrend that threatens to plunge the stock to all-time lows.
Daily Bar graph for $TTOO
T2 Biosystems Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO) is a leading developer of innovative diagnostic products designed to improve patient health. The company is an emerging leader in the field of vitro diagnostics thanks to its FDA approved T2DX instrument and T2Candida Panel.
The company’s proprietary T2 Magnetic Resonance Technology is designed to lower mortality rates as well as improve patient outcomes. The technology also helps in the reduction of healthcare costs by assisting physicians in making targeted treatment decisions.
T2 Bacteria Panel
T2 Biosystems Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO), T2 Bacteria Panel runs on the proprietary T2Dx instrument to provide high accurate species-specific test results of targeted bacterial infections. The product is currently available in the U.S. and the company is working on completing a pivotal trial after which it plans to file a 510(K) application with the FDA. Patient enrollment for the upcoming pivotal trial is 92% complete.
“The CE Mark of our T2Bacteria Panel is a significant milestone in our mission to save lives and improve healthcare by empowering clinicians to more effectively treat patients with sepsis faster than ever before,” said CEO, John McDonough.
Growing Interest
The CE mark in Europe validates T2 Bacteria Panel technology as a Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device. The vitro diagnostic product has already proved to be reliable in the identification of six of the most deadly and prevalent bacteria species not covered by empiric therapy.
The T2 Bacteria Panel continues to register a significant increase in interest from new and existing customers under the Research USE Only program. Customers are currently testing the product as part of a testing phase expected to accelerate adoption post-FDA clearance.
“We are pleased to be close to finalizing the submission of our T2Bacteria Panel to the FDA,” said Tom Lowery Chief Scientific Officer.

12 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Tuesday 

Mid-Day Market Update: Tile Shop Drops On Earnings Miss; Educational Development Shares Climb 

T— Biosystems Joins Antimicrobials Working Group as First Diagnostic Member (GuruFocus)



 
The emergence of superbugs and drug-resistant bacteria have many talking about antibiotic overprescribing, a practice common in the desperate treatment of sepsis.
With a U.S. incidence rate of more than 1 million and an estimated mortality rate between 28 and 50 percent, sepsis is a formidable foe with a range of possible causes, requiring physicians to initiate treatment plans on guesswork as they await the slow results of blood diagnostics.
“If you guess right, you can save their life, so it’s the right thing to do,” T2 Biosystems Inc (NASDAQ: TTOO) CEO John McDonough said.
But a wrong guess can lead to death or, at the very least, strengthen bacterial resistance to drugs.
To address the problem, T2 blends nanotechnology and advanced magnetic resonance methods to hasten detection and inform treatment of sepsis. It currently markets T2Candida for fungal infections, and last week, it secured approval to distribute T2Bacteria Panel in Europe.
“For the first time, we’re able to identify the specific source of that bacteria or fungal infection directly from the blood without a blood culture, and our detection time ranges between three and five hours,” McDonough said.
What's Up Next
McDonough said trials for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are 92-percent complete, and he’s hopeful to secure clearance before the end of 2017 to initiate a U.S. rollout in early 2018.
Primarily targeting midsize-to-large U.S. hospitals, T2 aims to support in-patients with hospital-acquired infections and emergency drop-in patients presenting with signs of sepsis.
So far, it’s reported positive feedback from early clients.
Detroit’s Henry Ford Health System allegedly demonstrated annual savings of more than $2 million since its adoption of T2 products, which eliminated speculative prescription methods, prevented the expense of ultimately ineffective drugs and limited patient time in the hospital.
“We can enable up to 95 percent of patients to get on the right drug the first time in the first six hours, and it’s a real game changer,” McDonough said.
T2’s Rough Financial Ride
Despite management optimism, T2’s stock has trended down since early 2015, and it hit an all-time low in mid-July. It’s now down 48 percent year to date.
However, McDonough said he is comfortable with the firm’s cash position ━ $50 million as of the end of June ━ and does not need to raise capital.
“I think the share price, we’re not crazy about where that price is,” he said. “But we also know that we had some big early-venture investors that even go back to 2006 and 2007 who may be selling, and of course if you have that kind of selling of such a thinly traded stock like T2, it will put enormous pressure on the price. We’re hopeful and believe that the current price is not reflective of the performance of the company but perhaps other market dynamics that are in play.”

T2 BIOSYSTEMS RECEIVES CE MARK FOR T2BACTERIA™ PANEL ENABLING COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE
New Diagnostic Test Panel Expands Platform Menu Providing Comprehensive T2Sepsis Solution™ for Hospitals



















July 18, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: T2 Biosystems, Inc.






LEXINGTON, Mass., July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTOO), an emerging leader in the development of innovative diagnostic products to improve patient health, announced today that it has received a CE Mark for its T2Bacteria Panel, allowing for the sale and distribution of the product within the European Union and those countries accepting the CE Mark. The T2Bacteria Panel runs on the Company’s proprietary T2Dx® Instrument and provides highly accurate species-specific test results of targeted bacterial infections direct from whole blood in as fast as about 3.5 hours, and without the need for a time-consuming blood culture. The T2Bacteria Panel is currently available in the United States for Research Use Only (RUO) and the Company is in the final stages of completing the FDA pivotal trial, after which a 510(k) application will be submitted to the FDA. Patient enrollment in the trial is currently 92% complete and the company is very pleased with the product performance demonstrated to date, which for the prospective arm of the study is showing an average sensitivity of 96% and average specificity of 98%. The T2Candida® Panel and the T2Dx Instrument were both CE-marked and FDA-cleared in 2014 and now, combined with the new T2Bacteria Panel, provide a comprehensive sepsis solution for hospitals in Europe. Consistent with previous guidance, the company believes it is on track to potentially receive FDA clearance of the T2Bacteria Panel by the end of 2017 enabling a US commercial launch in early 2018. Once the clinical trial is complete, the company will provide a full update on the product performance metrics submitted to the FDA. “The CE Mark of our T2Bacteria Panel is a significant milestone in our mission to save lives and improve healthcare by empowering clinicians to more effectively treat patients with sepsis faster than ever before,” said John McDonough, president and chief executive officer. “Our T2Sepsis Solution now includes T2Candida and T2Bacteria, creating a significant opportunity to expand our target hospitals and positioning T2 Biosystems for accelerated commercial growth.” CE Mark confirms that the product meets the Essential Requirements of the European Directive on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. The T2Bacteria Panel will be commercially available as part of the T2Sepsis Solution in Europe in the third quarter 2017. The T2Bacteria Panel identifies six of the most deadly and prevalent bacteria species that are often not covered by empiric therapy. The prevalence of bacterial infections is high in hospitals across the world and the T2Bacteria Panel identifies approximately 90% of all gram-negative infections coming in through the emergency department and approximately 70% of community-acquired infections in the emergency department. Current broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy regimens only cover 60% of all bloodstream infections. Test results generated from the T2Candida Panel and T2Bacteria Panel, when coupled with current empiric therapy practices, may empower healthcare teams to effectively treat up to 95% of all bloodstream infections presenting in hospitals within the first 4 hours. Additionally, the company is seeing significant interest from new and existing customers in working with the T2Bacteria RUO Panel under a Research Use Only program where customers can begin early validation testing to accelerate adoption post FDA clearance. “We are pleased to be close to finalizing the submission of our T2Bacteria Panel to the FDA,” said Tom Lowery, chief scientific officer. “Even more encouraging are the early responses we have been receiving from hospitals taking advantage of the T2Bacteria Panel under the RUO program.  We believe the RUO program will provide independent data for hospitals to present at conferences and for publications later this year and into 2018.” T2 Biosystems will provide an additional, more comprehensive update on its upcoming second quarter 2017 financial update call and at this time is reiterating its prior financial guidance. About T2 Biosystems T2 Biosystems is dedicated to developing innovative diagnostic products to improve patient health. With the FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida Panel targeting sepsis and a range of additional products in development, T2 Biosystems is an emerging leader in the field of in vitro diagnostics. The Company is utilizing its proprietary T2 Magnetic Resonance technology, or T2MR®, to develop a broad set of applications aimed at lowering mortality rates, improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare by helping medical professionals make targeted treatment decisions earlier. T2MR enables the fast and sensitive detection of pathogens, biomarkers and other abnormalities in a variety of patient sample types, including whole blood.
