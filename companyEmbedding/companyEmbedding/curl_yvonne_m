Explanation of Responses:

1. Pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit award agreements, additional restricted stock units ("RSUs") are credited to each non-employee director's account on common stock dividend payment dates.  The number of RSUs credited is equal to (a) the product of (i) the number of the RSUs in each director's account on the associated dividend record date and (ii) the per share dividend, divided by (b) the closing price on the dividend payment date. On January 17, 2017, HealthSouth paid a dividend on its common stock of $0.24 per share. The transaction reported on this Form 4 is an award of RSUs associated with that dividend payment.
