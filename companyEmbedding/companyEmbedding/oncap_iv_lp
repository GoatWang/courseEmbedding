I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July. Allowing five working days it should be on hand prior to the 18th.  RT                   Jul 26, 2017  Haven't yet opened product as it was bought to replace another still in use.

The quality of the toner is very good and consistent. Please work on improving the print quality towards the end of the cartridge life, after 6 months the print tends to be lighter with every print.

Why We Are Different
ONCAP’s philosophy is predicated on partnering with great management teams, applying appropriate capital structures and working to create shareholder value at each operating company over the long term. ONCAP typically makes fewer investments than most other private equity firms and leverages the resources and experience of the ONCAP team and Onex Corporation to make every investment successful.

How We Have Performed
Since our inception in 2000, ONCAP has completed 21 investments and has generated a 4.8x gross multiple of capital invested and a gross compound annual internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 41.8% on its 11 realized investments. ONCAP has never suffered a capital impairment on any realized investment.
