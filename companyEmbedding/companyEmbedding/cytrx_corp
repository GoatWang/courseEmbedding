CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ: CYTR) is a biopharmaceutical research and development oncology company based in Los Angeles, California.
The CytRx oncology pipeline includes clinical trials involving their lead drug aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a modified form of doxorubicin, the popular anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent known as "red death".
Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation.

General[edit]
CytRx plans to expand its pipeline of oncology candidates at its laboratory facilities in Freiburg, Germany, based on novel linker technologies that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and may allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites.
The corporate website is http://www.cytrx.com/aldoxorubicin
Steven Arthur Kriegsman is the President and CEO.
Aldoxorubicin[edit]
Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate. Specifically, it is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin (DOXO) attached to an acid sensitive linker (EMCH).
Completed preclinical and clinical trials (see below) indicate that this novel agent has attributes that improve on native doxorubicin including reduction of adverse events, improvement in efficacy and the ability to reach the tumor more quickly. CytRx holds the exclusive worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin.
Stock promotion[edit]
In 2014 CytRx was involved in a stock promotion scheme, paying DreamTeamGroup US$65,000 to write at least 13 articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha, Forbes.com, Motley Fool, and Cheat Sheet. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure, and were reviewed and edited by CytRx management. The stock price doubled following the articles. The articles and author profile pages (including pseudonyms) were removed after investigation by CNNMoney.[1][2] A class action lawsuit has been filed against CytRx.[3]
The events leading to CytRx lawsuits were revealed by a Seeking Alpha author named Richard Pearson who was shorting the CytRx company stock and the "short attack" was revealed by another Seeking Alpha author PhD. who wrote about the science of aldoxorubicin and revealed the motives behind Richard Pearson's article to short the company's stock. The second Seeking Alpha article pointed to a financial motive for the negative article and that the author Richard Pearson took a short position in CytRx company stock 3 days before he published his article about CytRx. http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/4519051-nir-etkovitz/2756043-behind-the-short-are-investors-of-cytrx-that-shallow

CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ: CYTR) is a biopharmaceutical research and development oncology company based in Los Angeles, California.
The CytRx oncology pipeline includes clinical trials involving their lead drug aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a modified form of doxorubicin, the popular anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent known as "red death".
Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation.

General[edit]
CytRx plans to expand its pipeline of oncology candidates at its laboratory facilities in Freiburg, Germany, based on novel linker technologies that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and may allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites.
The corporate website is http://www.cytrx.com/aldoxorubicin
Steven Arthur Kriegsman is the President and CEO.
Aldoxorubicin[edit]
Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate. Specifically, it is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin (DOXO) attached to an acid sensitive linker (EMCH).
Completed preclinical and clinical trials (see below) indicate that this novel agent has attributes that improve on native doxorubicin including reduction of adverse events, improvement in efficacy and the ability to reach the tumor more quickly. CytRx holds the exclusive worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin.
Stock promotion[edit]
In 2014 CytRx was involved in a stock promotion scheme, paying DreamTeamGroup US$65,000 to write at least 13 articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha, Forbes.com, Motley Fool, and Cheat Sheet. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure, and were reviewed and edited by CytRx management. The stock price doubled following the articles. The articles and author profile pages (including pseudonyms) were removed after investigation by CNNMoney.[1][2] A class action lawsuit has been filed against CytRx.[3]
The events leading to CytRx lawsuits were revealed by a Seeking Alpha author named Richard Pearson who was shorting the CytRx company stock and the "short attack" was revealed by another Seeking Alpha author PhD. who wrote about the science of aldoxorubicin and revealed the motives behind Richard Pearson's article to short the company's stock. The second Seeking Alpha article pointed to a financial motive for the negative article and that the author Richard Pearson took a short position in CytRx company stock 3 days before he published his article about CytRx. http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/4519051-nir-etkovitz/2756043-behind-the-short-are-investors-of-cytrx-that-shallow

    		CytRx Corp. (CYTR) is a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in the optimized delivery of anti-cancer drugs. The CYTR oncology pipeline is focused on the clinical development of aldoxorubicin (formerly known as INNO-206), its improved version of the widely used chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin.  		CYTR has initiated an international Phase 2b clinical trial as a treatment for soft tissue sarcomas, has completed its Phase 1b/2 clinical trial primarily in the same indication, and has initiated a Phase 1b pharmacokinetics clinical trial in patients with metastatic solid tumors and a Phase 1b study of aldoxorubicin in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors.  		The company is preparing for a Phase 3 pivotal trial under a special protocol assessment (SPA) with aldoxorubicin as a therapy for patients with soft tissue sarcomas whose tumors have progressed following treatment with chemotherapy. CYTR plans to start a Phase 2 trial in Q4 2013 with aldoxorubicin as a treatment for stage IV brain cancer, also called glioblastoma. A Phase 2 trial in Kaposi’s sarcoma is set to commence in Q4 2013 as well. CYTR is expanding its pipeline of oncology candidates based on a novel linker platform technology that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and could allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites.  		CYTR also has rights to two additional drug candidates: tamibarotene and bafetinib. The Company completed its evaluation of bafetinib in the ENABLE Phase 2 clinical trial in high-risk B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), and plans to seek a partner for further development of bafetinib, and is evaluating further development of tamibarotene.  Company Website  Corporate Presentation  		    		Investment Highlights   			FDA granted SPA for Pivotal Phase 3 trial with aldoxorubicin in 2nd-line soft tissue sarcomas  			Aldoxorubicin Phase 2b trial results expected in 4Q 2013  			Aldoxorubicin more than doubled survival in animal models of glioblastoma leading to a Phase 2b trial in Q4 2013  			Statistically significant results in glioblastoma animal models leading to a Phase 2b trial in 2H 2013  			Unique platform technology provides pipeline of additional drug candidates and intellectual property  			Capital to support near and mid-term milestones 			  					$28 million as of 6/30/13  					No debt     		    Development Portfolio    Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a novel conjugate of the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin that binds covalently to albumin, the most abundant protein in blood plasma, and is circulated throughout the body. Aldoxorubicin has been granted orphan drug designation by the Office of Orphan Product Development of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcomas and pancreatic cancer.  		Doxorubicin is a standard chemotherapeutic treatment for a variety of cancers and is used either alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents. Aldoxorubicin is designed with a linker that releases doxorubicin in the low pH environment of tumors, concentrating the chemotherapeutic agent where it preferentially damages the tumor while minimizing the effect on healthy tissues. This conjugate formulation has the potential to safely deliver greater amounts of doxorubicin directly to the tumor compared with standard doxorubicin treatment, which could lead to improved efficacy. CYTR holds the exclusive worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin.  		In a Phase 1 clinical trial, aldoxorubicin was administered in doses at up to six times the standard dosing of doxorubicin without an increase in observed side effects over those historically seen with doxorubicin. Animal studies conducted by aldoxorubicin inventor Dr. Felix Kratz, Department of Medical Oncology, Clinical Research, at the Tumor Biology Center in Freiburg, Germany, demonstrated statistically significant results in breast, ovarian, pancreatic and small cell lung cancers. Results of these studies were published in several peer-reviewed journals. Aldoxorubicin has also demonstrated activity in pre-clinical models of glioblastoma and multiple myeloma.  		CYTR completed a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial with aldoxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors and presented favorable data at the ASCO conference in Chicago, Illinois, in June:   			Clinical benefit (defined as partial response and stable disease of more than four months) with aldoxorubicin at the maximum tolerated dose was shown in 10 of 13 (76.9%) evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory soft tissue sarcoma.  			Best response for the 13 evaluable soft tissue sarcoma trial subjects included the following: 			  					Five (38.5%) achieved partial response, as defined as tumor shrinkage of more than 30%;    					Seven (53.8%) showed prolonged stable disease (defined as tumor shrinkage <30% from baseline or tumor growth <20% from the nadir);  					Eight (61.5%) had tumor shrinkage; and five of eight patients (62.5%) who demonstrated either partial responses or prolonged stable disease after treatment with aldoxorubicin had been previously treated with doxorubicin and had failed to respond.    			There were no observed cardiac toxicities and no drug-related patient deaths. The most common adverse event, neutropenia, also observed with doxorubicin treatment, resolved prior to the start of the next treatment.  			Median estimated progression-free survival for advanced soft tissue sarcoma patients in the trial was 6.4 months with a range of 1.0 to more than 10.7 months. This compares favorably with the historical median progression-free survival for this patient population of approximately three months.   		In December 2011, CYTR initiated its international Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin as a first-line treatment in patients with soft tissue sarcoma who are ineligible for surgery. The Phase 2b clinical trial will provide the first direct clinical trial comparison of aldoxorubicin with native doxorubicin, which is dose-limited due to toxicity, as a first-line therapy. The top-line results are expected in Q4 2013.   Primary Target    Soft Tissue Sarcomas  		Soft Tissue Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer. The term sarcoma comes from a Greek word meaning fleshy growth. Soft tissue sarcoma can occur in the muscles, fat, blood vessels, tendons, fibrous tissues and synovial tissues (tissues around joints). There are more than 50 subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma.  		The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2011 more than 11,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcomas were diagnosed in the United States and approximately 3,900 deaths were caused by these cancers.  		Doxorubicin-based therapy is the standard of care for advanced, metastatic disease. Despite advances in research, all patients will progress on existing treatments. There is a tremendous need for better treatment options.  		    Platform Benefits  		Chemotherapy is the backbone of cancer treatment and will remain even with newer targeted therapies.   			Limitations of chemotherapy: 			  					Toxicity: normal organs affected  					Poor efficacy: can’t get high drug concentrations to the tumor    			CYTR’s Tumor Concentrating Technology: 			  					Harnesses body’s own albumin as a means to concentrate drug in the tumor  					Allows greater amounts of drug to be given at each cycle and for additional cycles than the standard drug  					Reduces adverse events  					Ability to concentrate drug at specific sites  					Large array of chemotherapy agents can be used     		    Strategic Collaboration    		CYTR has an exclusive worldwide license from KTB Tumor Biology Institute in Freiburg, Germany. Linker molecules have the potential to treat the majority of solid tumors and blood cancers and have a broad utility: many chemotherapy drugs have been attached to the linker: doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cisplatin, irinotecan, methotrexate.  Linker Is Multi-Functional   			Keeps drug inactive until released and has fewer side effects  			Once infused, linker binds to albumin which takes it to the tumor  			Linker breaks apart due to low pH in the tumor, releases drug   		    Management Team  		CYTR is backed by a strong management team of highly experienced business leaders, scientists and other professionals. This leadership team has decades of involvement in the biopharmaceutical, drug development, legal, finance and business operations, creating a solid backbone to support the company's growth strategy and product development.  		   Steven A. Kriegsman - President and Chief Executive Officer  		Steven Kriegsman has been CYTR's President and CEO and a director since July 2002.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ: CYTR) is a biopharmaceutical research and development oncology company based in Los Angeles, California.
The CytRx oncology pipeline includes clinical trials involving their lead drug aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a modified form of doxorubicin, the popular anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent known as "red death".
Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation.

General[edit]
CytRx plans to expand its pipeline of oncology candidates at its laboratory facilities in Freiburg, Germany, based on novel linker technologies that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and may allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites.
The corporate website is http://www.cytrx.com/aldoxorubicin
Steven Arthur Kriegsman is the President and CEO.
Aldoxorubicin[edit]
Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate. Specifically, it is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin (DOXO) attached to an acid sensitive linker (EMCH).
Completed preclinical and clinical trials (see below) indicate that this novel agent has attributes that improve on native doxorubicin including reduction of adverse events, improvement in efficacy and the ability to reach the tumor more quickly. CytRx holds the exclusive worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin.
Stock promotion[edit]
In 2014 CytRx was involved in a stock promotion scheme, paying DreamTeamGroup US$65,000 to write at least 13 articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha, Forbes.com, Motley Fool, and Cheat Sheet. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure, and were reviewed and edited by CytRx management. The stock price doubled following the articles. The articles and author profile pages (including pseudonyms) were removed after investigation by CNNMoney.[1][2] A class action lawsuit has been filed against CytRx.[3]
The events leading to CytRx lawsuits were revealed by a Seeking Alpha author named Richard Pearson who was shorting the CytRx company stock and the "short attack" was revealed by another Seeking Alpha author PhD. who wrote about the science of aldoxorubicin and revealed the motives behind Richard Pearson's article to short the company's stock. The second Seeking Alpha article pointed to a financial motive for the negative article and that the author Richard Pearson took a short position in CytRx company stock 3 days before he published his article about CytRx. http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/4519051-nir-etkovitz/2756043-behind-the-short-are-investors-of-cytrx-that-shallow

CytRx - Wikipedia





















 






CytRx

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This article relies too much on references to primary sources. Please improve this by adding secondary or tertiary sources. (April 2007) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


CytRx Corp. (NASDAQ: CYTR) is a biopharmaceutical research and development oncology company based in Los Angeles, California.
The CytRx oncology pipeline includes clinical trials involving their lead drug aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a modified form of doxorubicin, the popular anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent known as "red death".
Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation.

General[edit]
CytRx plans to expand its pipeline of oncology candidates at its laboratory facilities in Freiburg, Germany, based on novel linker technologies that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and may allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites.
The corporate website is http://www.cytrx.com/aldoxorubicin
Steven Arthur Kriegsman is the President and CEO.
Aldoxorubicin[edit]
Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a tumor-targeted doxorubicin conjugate. Specifically, it is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin (DOXO) attached to an acid sensitive linker (EMCH).
Completed preclinical and clinical trials (see below) indicate that this novel agent has attributes that improve on native doxorubicin including reduction of adverse events, improvement in efficacy and the ability to reach the tumor more quickly. CytRx holds the exclusive worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin.
Stock promotion[edit]
In 2014 CytRx was involved in a stock promotion scheme, paying DreamTeamGroup US$65,000 to write at least 13 articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha, Forbes.com, Motley Fool, and Cheat Sheet. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure, and were reviewed and edited by CytRx management. The stock price doubled following the articles. The articles and author profile pages (including pseudonyms) were removed after investigation by CNNMoney.[1][2] A class action lawsuit has been filed against CytRx.[3]
The events leading to CytRx lawsuits were revealed by a Seeking Alpha author named Richard Pearson who was shorting the CytRx company stock and the "short attack" was revealed by another Seeking Alpha author PhD. who wrote about the science of aldoxorubicin and revealed the motives behind Richard Pearson's article to short the company's stock. The second Seeking Alpha article pointed to a financial motive for the negative article and that the author Richard Pearson took a short position in CytRx company stock 3 days before he published his article about CytRx. http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/4519051-nir-etkovitz/2756043-behind-the-short-are-investors-of-cytrx-that-shallow

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
