The Heckler & Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP. designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM), and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.[4][5][6]
While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.[7]

Overview[edit]
The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol,[8] and is capable of making a 2-inch (51 mm) group at 25 metres (27 yd).[9] The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant.[8] It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce.[8][10] It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).[8]
The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change.[11] It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor.[12]
Development[edit]
In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.[13]
The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 124 gr (8.0 g) 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure 185 gr (12.0 g) +P loading.[13]
The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon.[13]
After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.[13]
Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of 2.5 in (64 mm) at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.[13][14]
Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.[13]
Adoption[edit]
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an "offensive" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing "MK23 USSOCOM" engraved on the slide.[15] The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.[16]
HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.
Civilian Mark 23[edit]
Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).[17]
The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.[17] The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.
According to the Operators Manual,[18] there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving "Mark 23" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark "MARK 23" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of "MK23 USSOCOM", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.
Alternatives[edit]
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism.[19] The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.[20]
In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose,[21] the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size.[22] It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

Untitled[edit]
the place of origin is germany only! —Preceding unsigned comment added by 83.78.98.18 (talk) 19:34, 7 September 2008 (UTC)
Roundabout logic in the last paragraph-- the weapon it was developed from was apparently developed from it.
A silencer IS a sound suppressor.
Is the link to Mark 23 necessary? They're the same gun, the pages should be merged. Lord Bodak 15:50, 29 August 2005 (UTC)
...adds
They are, technically speaking during post-ban days, dinstinct weapons. the Mark23 is exclusive to civilian sales, and has different material properties in terms of finish, barrel material, external coating, not to mention using different magazines. I would still say merge them. Need expounding on which LAM is used
REDIRECT[edit]
Since this page neither contains any additional information, nor all info on this page is correct (Mark 23 Mod 0 is not the name for the civil market) I changed it to a redirect to Heckler & Koch MK23.
Article title?[edit]
'Mark 23' is the commercial civilian product. This was effectively an after-thought devised after the US Military adopted the 'MK23', the original firearm. Hayden120 (talk) 13:05, 9 July 2008 (UTC)

Yes, you are correct. The proper name should be Heckler & Koch Mk 23 Mod 0. Notice how I did not capitalize the "k" in the "Mark", the USN does not capitalize it either in their designations. Koalorka (talk) 14:03, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

I have changed the article title from Heckler & Koch MK23 to Heckler & Koch Mark 23. Mark 23 better reflects the article. The military model's name is Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, Mark 23, Model 0. That is abbreviated as Mk 23 Mod 0. It's pretty standard that the 'k' is not capitalized, and there is no space between Mk and the number. Mk 48, Mk 11, Mk 12, Mk 15Mk 16, Mk 17, and Mk 18 are a few examples. The civilian model is named Mark 23. I am aware that it is stamped MK23 on the slide, but that is just because letters are usually stamped all in capital letters. Pettifogger (talk) 00:55, 3 June 2012 (UTC)
Effective Range[edit]
I've had trouble getting the effective range changed to 50 meters. They even state in the description that it is capable of making a 2 inch group at 50 meters. If its only effective up to 25m, why the heck is this guy hitting the steel at 50 yards. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wt9R_GtQUA — Preceding unsigned comment added by 96.232.191.89 (talk) 13:14, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
Waterproof etc?[edit]
What exactly makes any given firearm waterproof? Furthermore, what are those "harsh conditions" that the gun was subjected to during trials and can apparently withstand in real life use? Clarification, please. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 38.122.43.186 (talk) 15:24, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

The Heckler & Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP. designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM), and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.[4][5][6]
While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.[7]

Overview[edit]
The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol,[8] and is capable of making a 2-inch (51 mm) group at 25 metres (27 yd).[9] The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant.[8] It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce.[8][10] It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).[8]
The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change.[11] It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor.[12]
Development[edit]
In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.[13]
The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 124 gr (8.0 g) 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure 185 gr (12.0 g) +P loading.[13]
The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon.[13]
After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.[13]
Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of 2.5 in (64 mm) at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.[13][14]
Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.[13]
Adoption[edit]
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an "offensive" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing "MK23 USSOCOM" engraved on the slide.[15] The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.[16]
HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.
Civilian Mark 23[edit]
Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).[17]
The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.[17] The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.
According to the Operators Manual,[18] there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving "Mark 23" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark "MARK 23" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of "MK23 USSOCOM", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.
Alternatives[edit]
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism.[19] The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.[20]
In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose,[21] the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size.[22] It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

The Heckler & Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP. designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM), and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.[4][5][6]
While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.[7]

The Heckler & Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP. designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM), and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.[4][5][6]
While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.[7]

Overview[edit]
The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol,[8] and is capable of making a 2-inch (51 mm) group at 25 metres (27 yd).[9] The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant.[8] It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce.[8][10] It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).[8]
The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change.[11] It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor.[12]
Development[edit]
In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.[13]
The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 124 gr (8.0 g) 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure 185 gr (12.0 g) +P loading.[13]
The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon.[13]
After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.[13]
Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of 2.5 in (64 mm) at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.[13][14]
Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.[13]
Adoption[edit]
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an "offensive" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing "MK23 USSOCOM" engraved on the slide.[15] The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.[16]
HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.
Civilian Mark 23[edit]
Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).[17]
The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.[17] The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.
According to the Operators Manual,[18] there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving "Mark 23" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark "MARK 23" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of "MK23 USSOCOM", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.
Alternatives[edit]
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism.[19] The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.[20]
In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose,[21] the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size.[22] It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

The Heckler & Koch MK 23, MK 23 MOD 0, Mark 23, or USSOCOM MARK 23, is a semi-automatic large-frame pistol chambered in .45 ACP. designed specifically to be an offensive pistol. The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM), and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an "Offensive Handgun Weapons System—Special Operations Peculiar", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units.[4][5][6]
While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23.[7]

Overview[edit]
The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol,[8] and is capable of making a 2-inch (51 mm) group at 25 metres (27 yd).[9] The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion-resistant.[8] It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce.[8][10] It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition).[8]
The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change.[11] It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor.[12]
Development[edit]
In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.[13]
The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 124 gr (8.0 g) 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure 185 gr (12.0 g) +P loading.[13]
The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon.[13]
After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard.[13]
Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of 2.5 in (64 mm) at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.[13][14]
Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.[13]
Adoption[edit]
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an "offensive" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing "MK23 USSOCOM" engraved on the slide.[15] The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.[16]
HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.
Civilian Mark 23[edit]
Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).[17]
The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.[17] The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.
According to the Operators Manual,[18] there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving "Mark 23" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark "MARK 23" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of "MK23 USSOCOM", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.
Alternatives[edit]
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism.[19] The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.[20]
In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose,[21] the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size.[22] It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.

Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of 2.5 in (64 mm) at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996.[13][14]
Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round.[13]
Adoption[edit]
The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an "offensive" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing "MK23 USSOCOM" engraved on the slide.[15] The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.[16]
HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.
Civilian Mark 23[edit]
Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany).[17]
The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban.[17] The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act.
According to the Operators Manual,[18] there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving "Mark 23" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll-mark "MARK 23" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of "MK23 USSOCOM", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably.
Alternatives[edit]
In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism.[19] The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol.[20]
In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose,[21] the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size.[22] It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations. Recently, HK has developed the HK 45, a much more contoured pistol based on the P2000, P8 and P30 models.
Users[edit]

 Canada: Used by the Peel Regional Police
 Indonesia: Komando Pasukan Katak (Kopaska) tactical diver group and Komando Pasukan Khusus (Kopassus) special forces group.[23]
 Malaysia: MK 23 MOD 0 adopted by Pasukan Gerakan Khas Counter-terrorism Police Squad of the Royal Malaysia Police.[24]
 Poland: Used by GROM.[25]
 United States: Adopted by the U.S. SOCOM. Deliveries commenced in 1996.[1]

Read More
  






In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.
VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis.
New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change.

TECHNOLOGY
 






						Cold Hammer Forged Polygonal Bore						


 Learn More
					

During the 1960s, Heckler & Koch perfected the famous polygonal profile barrel technology. Conventional lands-and-grooves rifling allow propellant gasses to escape around the front of the bullet as it is fired from the barrel muzzle. A polygonal bore profile effectively seals propellant gases behind the bullet—increasing bullet velocity. An added benefit of a polygonal barrel is its resistance to wear. A polygonal barrel will normally outlast a conventional “lands-and-grooves” barrel by thousands of rounds. Polygonal barrels were one of the many radical design elements used on the HK P7 series pistol and this same breakthrough technology is present on all current HK handguns. 








						Reinforced Polyamide (Polymer) Frame						


 Learn More
					

A radical new material used on the P9S pistol in the late 1960s, advanced polymers were soon used as major components and assemblies on a variety of HK products — including the receivers of MP5s in the 1960s. HK polymer molding technology led to the introduction of another synthetic framed HK handgun, the futuristic-looking VP70. Heckler & Koch pioneered the use of polymers more than fifteen years before competing firms. Today, HK remains a technology leader in the use of innovative and high-strength polyamides.

HK45  COMPACT

Read More
  






Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45. Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected. The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors. Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand. Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking. By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required. Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull. Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

P2000SK

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.
The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.
The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.
A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.





Features & System Characteristics:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Contoured, extended slide release
Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Rated 5 out of 5  by matt from Awesome gun Ive wanted one of these for awhile now lucky SG got it for a lower price than any other site ive seen and ive seen them all, the shipping took alot longer than i had hoped for but it all went well and was worth the wait, its a pricey gun but you get what you pay for, i wanted this one mainly as an end of the world gun being that it will last 30.000 rounds before the barrel starts to go and 6.000 rounds before it should jam and that 45s are a fairly common and cheap round i should be good to go, if that never happens i got a great target pistol and home defence gun, the mods for the gun arent easy to come by being the mk23 rail is only for mods made for the mk23 unless you get an adaptor, im also gonna give you an idea as to the masive size of the pistol. Below ive posted pictures of the mk23 next to other handguns you may be more familar with.

The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.
The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
And like its larger frame counterparts, the P30SK is available in multiple trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.
