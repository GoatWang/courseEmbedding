Opinion            
The mighty Amazon may soon go the way of the Roman Empire

Breaking            
Nearly $29 billion in market cap wiped from Amazon's new rivals in grocery space
Amazon's  dramatic push into the grocery space with its planned acquisition of Whole Foods  has wiped nearly $29 billion from the aggregate market cap of rivals in the grocery category. Wal-Mart Stores  lost over $14 billion in market value, Costco's  market cap fell by more than $5 billion, and Target  and Kroger  each saw a reduction of more than $3 billion. U.S.-listed shares of Ahold Delhaize , which owns U.S. chains including Giant and Food Lion, saw its value drop by nearly $2 billion. Smaller rivals including Supervalu , Sprouts  and Weis Markets  also nursed heavy losses.

Opinion            
The mighty Amazon may soon go the way of the Roman Empire

Breaking            
Nearly $29 billion in market cap wiped from Amazon's new rivals in grocery space
Amazon's  dramatic push into the grocery space with its planned acquisition of Whole Foods  has wiped nearly $29 billion from the aggregate market cap of rivals in the grocery category. Wal-Mart Stores  lost over $14 billion in market value, Costco's  market cap fell by more than $5 billion, and Target  and Kroger  each saw a reduction of more than $3 billion. U.S.-listed shares of Ahold Delhaize , which owns U.S. chains including Giant and Food Lion, saw its value drop by nearly $2 billion. Smaller rivals including Supervalu , Sprouts  and Weis Markets  also nursed heavy losses.

History[edit]




Map of Weis stores (as of 2011).


Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.
The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.




A Weis supermarket in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.


The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,[2] then Weis Self-Service Markets,[3] and finally Weis Markets.[4]
In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,[5] followed by a store in Frederick in August[6] Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.[7] In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.[8] Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.[9]
Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,[10] and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.[11][12] Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis.
Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.
Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.[13] A store that opened in Flanders closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered the Flanders market in 2014, in a former A&P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store.[14]
In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain.[15] Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.[16]
Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland after that chain announced it was closing all its stores.[19] In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.[20] On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a 65,000-square-foot (6,039 m2) store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine.[21]
Robert and Jonathan Weis[edit]
Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Force. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company’s finances, real estate and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company President after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as Chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.
Legal case[edit]
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine." The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.
Banners[edit]
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.
Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.
Competition[edit]
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.
In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Giant Eagle, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover).
In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite and Stop & Shop.
In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans.
In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.
Private brand labels[edit]
Weis Markets sells a variety of house brands under the following private brand labels:

Weis Quality (Advertised as equivalent to national brands)

Beer sales[edit]
Weis Markets is one of the supermarkets in Pennsylvania able to sell beer and wine in in-store cafés at some of its locations. In Pennsylvania, grocery stores cannot sell beer unless they operate a café. Weis Markets sells beer and wine at 52 Pennsylvania locations. In June 2016, PA Governor Tom Wolf signed Act 39 law permitting the sale of wine in licensed supermarket beer cafes.

History[edit]




Map of Weis stores (as of 2011).


Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.
The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.




A Weis supermarket in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.


The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,[2] then Weis Self-Service Markets,[3] and finally Weis Markets.[4]
In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,[5] followed by a store in Frederick in August[6] Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.[7] In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.[8] Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.[9]
Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,[10] and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.[11][12] Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis.
Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.
Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.[13] A store that opened in Flanders closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered the Flanders market in 2014, in a former A&P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store.[14]
In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain.[15] Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.[16]
Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland after that chain announced it was closing all its stores.[19] In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.[20] On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a 65,000-square-foot (6,039 m2) store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine.[21]
Robert and Jonathan Weis[edit]
Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Force. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company’s finances, real estate and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company President after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as Chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.
Legal case[edit]
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine." The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.
Banners[edit]
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.
Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.
Competition[edit]
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.
In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Giant Eagle, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover).
In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite and Stop & Shop.
In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans.
In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

Weis Markets sells a variety of house brands under the following private brand labels:

Weis Quality (Advertised as equivalent to national brands)

Beer sales[edit]
Weis Markets is one of the supermarkets in Pennsylvania able to sell beer and wine in in-store cafés at some of its locations. In Pennsylvania, grocery stores cannot sell beer unless they operate a café. Weis Markets sells beer and wine at 52 Pennsylvania locations. In June 2016, PA Governor Tom Wolf signed Act 39 law permitting the sale of wine in licensed supermarket beer cafes.

History[edit]




Map of Weis stores (as of 2011).


Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.
The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.

The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,[2] then Weis Self-Service Markets,[3] and finally Weis Markets.[4]
In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,[5] followed by a store in Frederick in August[6] Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.[7] In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.[8] Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.[9]
Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,[10] and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.[11][12] Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis.
Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.
Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.[13] A store that opened in Flanders closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered the Flanders market in 2014, in a former A&P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store.[14]
In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain.[15] Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.[16]
Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland after that chain announced it was closing all its stores.[19] In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.[20] On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a 65,000-square-foot (6,039 m2) store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine.[21]
Robert and Jonathan Weis[edit]
Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Force. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company’s finances, real estate and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company President after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as Chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.
Legal case[edit]
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine." The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.
Banners[edit]
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.
Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.
Competition[edit]
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.
In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Giant Eagle, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover).
In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite and Stop & Shop.
In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans.
In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

Weis Markets sells a variety of house brands under the following private brand labels:

In Pennsylvania, grocery stores cannot sell beer unless they operate a café. Weis Markets sells beer and wine at 52 Pennsylvania locations. In June 2016, PA Governor Tom Wolf signed Act 39 law permitting the sale of wine in licensed supermarket beer cafes.

The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.
Banners[edit]
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.
Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.
Competition[edit]
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.
In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Giant Eagle, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover).
In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite and Stop & Shop.
In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans.
In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

History[edit]




Map of Weis stores (as of 2011).


Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.
The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.




A Weis supermarket in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.


The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,[2] then Weis Self-Service Markets,[3] and finally Weis Markets.[4]
In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,[5] followed by a store in Frederick in August[6] Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.[7] In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.[8] Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.[9]
Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,[10] and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.[11][12] Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis.
Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.
Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.[13] A store that opened in Flanders closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered the Flanders market in 2014, in a former A&P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store.[14]
In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain.[15] Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.[16]
Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland after that chain announced it was closing all its stores.[19] In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.[20] On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a 65,000-square-foot (6,039 m2) store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine.[21]
Robert and Jonathan Weis[edit]
Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Force. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company’s finances, real estate and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company President after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as Chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.
Legal case[edit]
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine." The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.

In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg.

History[edit]




Map of Weis stores (as of 2011).


Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.
The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.




A Weis supermarket in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.


The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,[2] then Weis Self-Service Markets,[3] and finally Weis Markets.[4]
In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,[5] followed by a store in Frederick in August[6] Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.[7] In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.[8] Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union.[9]
Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,[10] and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.[11][12] Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis.
Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia.
Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992.[13] A store that opened in Flanders closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered the Flanders market in 2014, in a former A&P store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store.[14]
In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain.[15] Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate.[16]
Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania.[17][18]
In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland after that chain announced it was closing all its stores.[19] In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.[20] On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016.
On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a 65,000-square-foot (6,039 m2) store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine.[21]
Robert and Jonathan Weis[edit]
Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Force. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company’s finances, real estate and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company President after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became Chairman Emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as Chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015.
Legal case[edit]
The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine." The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.[22] At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid 1970s, at which time Weis move across U.S. Route 220 to its current location.
Banners[edit]
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.
Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.
Competition[edit]
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.
In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Giant Eagle, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover).
In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite and Stop & Shop.
In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans.
In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

Weis Markets sells a variety of house brands under the following private brand labels:

Beer sales[edit]
Weis Markets is one of the supermarkets in Pennsylvania able to sell beer and wine in in-store cafés at some of its locations. In Pennsylvania, grocery stores cannot sell beer unless they operate a café. Weis Markets sells beer and wine at 52 Pennsylvania locations. In June 2016, PA Governor Tom Wolf signed Act 39 law permitting the sale of wine in licensed supermarket beer cafes.

About WEIS MARKETS, INC.

   The Weis family is wise to the ways of grocery retailing. Weis (pronounced "Wise") Markets runs more than 160 grocery stores (averaging about 49,000 sq. ft.), mostly in Pennsylvania, but also in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and West Virginia, as well as a single Save-A-Lot discount store in Pennsylvania. (In recent years, the company has converted its Mr. Z's Food Mart, King's Supermarkets, and Cressler's Marketplace stores to the Weis Markets banner to go to market under a unified retail presence.) The founding Weis family controls the company.
   Operations

   The grocery chain operates its business through a single segment: grocery retail.
  

   Weis stores are supported by Pennsylvania-based distribution centers, an ice cream plant, meat processing plant, milk processing facility, and warehouse complex.
  

   The company's retail food stores sell groceries, dairy products, frozen foods, meats, seafood, fresh produce, floral, pharmacy services, deli products, prepared foods, bakery products, beer and wine, fuel and general merchandise items, such as health and beauty care and household products.
  

   Center Store sales generated about 58% of Weis Market's 2015 revenue; the rest comes from Fresh Food sales (30%), Pharmacy Services (9%), and Fuel (3%).
  
Geographic Reach

   The company operates 163 retail food stores in Pennsylvania and four surrounding states: Maryland, New Jersey, New York and West Virginia.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The regional grocery company advertises its products and brands through weekly newspaper circulars, radio and TV ads, e-mail, and online via its website, social media, and mobile applications. Weis Markets spent $23 million on advertising in 2015, compared with $24.6 million in 2014.
  
Financial Performance

   The company has seen steady revenue growth over the past few years. In 2015 its revenues increased almost 4% due to investments in lower pricing and sales building programs that guarantee the lower prices.
  

   Net income rose 7.5% in 2015 to $55 million from 2014 after two years of declining profit. Higher sales led to the profit rise.
  

   Operating cash flow increased to $136.7 million in 2015 from $123 million in 2014.
  
Strategy

   Century-old Weis Markets continues to remake itself by investing in new superstore construction, expanding and remodeling established stores, and acquiring new ones. The strategy includes developing improved customer service training and setting customer service measurements and goals and ramping up its information technology systems and distribution network.
  

   It's also adding new services, such as online shopping, and an in-store beer garden. In 2015 the company began offering online shopping with in-store pick-up at its Camp Hill Store.
  

   In 2014 Weis Markets opened an in-store beer café in its Roosevelt Boulevard store in York, and its Selinsgrove, and Doylestown stores. The company also opened a new Flanders store.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2015 Weis acquired property, store, and equipment in Hamover, Pennsylvania from C&S Wholesale Grocers for about $8 million.
  
Company Background

   It acquired three of the Genuardi's Family Markets' stores in the Philadelphia area from grocery-giant Safeway in 2012. The stores reopened under the Weis banner.
  

   Once a more diverse retailer, the company sold the last of its SuperPetz pet supply warehouse stores in 2011.
  

   To spur sales, Weis instituted periodic "Price Freeze" events in 2009. The events freeze and lower prices on thousands of staple items.
  

   Weis Markets was founded in 1912.
