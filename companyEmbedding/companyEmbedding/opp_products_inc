1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.




2. 
As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Special Risks:  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


9. 
This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

Industrial Automation: Answers for Manufacturing Productivity




The most forward-thinking companies turn to Siemens every day for answers that enable smart, fast and lean manufacturing. Driven by a nearly universal client requirement to drive process efficiency, our industrial automation solutions are rigorously engineered to:



Assess client technology and efficiency needs
Build a tailored plan that drives quick time to value
Deploy sensors to monitor manufacturing process performance
Automate processes using software, data and logic controllers





  Schlafly Hops Over Growth Limits  
With growing demand for craft brewed beer and limited expansion potential, Schlafly needed to increase output within their brewery, while maintaining the quality of their craft beer brews.
Schlafly automated brewing tasks, introduced process controls and systematically applied data intelligence using industrial automation technology from Siemens.
The brewery was able to increase process efficiency by 30%, while improving product consistency.













 The BRAUMAT process control system is based on a SIMATIC PCS 7 platform. It took over routine functions like turning on pumps and the opening and closing of valves. Those functions now happen consistently and on time – taking minutes off the average brew cycle.

The kind of transformation going on at Schlafly Bottleworks is just one example of how Siemens industrial automation solutions are helping our customers stay ahead of the competition.
















  Dependable Technology from a Trusted Partner  

Siemens industrial automation technology and deep domain expertise drives process efficiency, enables quality control and lowers operating costs. Working with clients to understand their manufacturing challenges, Siemens solutions include:


 Advanced process control technology such as SIMATIC PCS 7, which provide a solid foundation to optimize manufacturing with sensors, software and logic control mechanisms.

Pictures of the Future: Solutions for tomorrow’s world
Advanced manufacturing and maximized production efficiency are two key topics in the spring 2013 edition of Pictures of the Future. Advanced manufacturing refers to the next generation of production planning and production engineering processes, based on a smart combination of manufacturing software with sensors, processors, and communications technology, to link the digital, virtual, and real worlds of production. The goal is to use information technology to seamlessly link the value chain all the way from product design, production planning and production engineering to the actual production process, maintenance, and service. Siemens will be an important pioneer in these flexible and efficient production processes, thanks to its leadership in integrated automation technology and related manufacturing software solutions in areas such as product lifecycle management.

	The Breakdown on Brakes
OPP Racing carries a full line of motorcycle brake upgrades: brake (and clutch) levers, braided brake lines, brake rotors, brake calipers and brake pads. To help you navigate the huge array of choices, we've chosen to "brake" up our categories:
THE ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE BRAKE SYSTEM
Brembo is the largest and most advanced brake system company in the world. If you look carefully on MotoGP, Superbike and limited production model bikes all you will find is Brembo. Virtually all the necessary brake components for motorcycles can be upgraded to Brembo one by one or all at once. Most are even offered in direct bolt-on kits for ease of install. When you want to improve braking performance the best solution is Brembo.

BRAKE AND CLUTCH LEVERS
Replacing your brake and clutch levers do not yield an increase in braking performance but enhances the comfort and look of your motorcycle.

LighTech brake & clutch levers are used extensively by World Superbike riders. Most often mated with a Brembo master cylinders but also available for OEM systems, LighTech's remote adjust brake levers allow racers to adjust for brake fade on-the-fly without taking their right hand off the throttle. LighTech levers are also popular as ergonomic upgrades with adjustable lever travel and crash damage mitigation with their folding lever. Last but not least - sleek & beautiful Italian styling!






LighTech Adjustable Brake Levers

Gilles Tooling is the newest company to offer replacement brake and clutch levers. Featuring a ratcheting adjustment mechanism, 3 unique looks and choice of Gold / Silver / Black, there's a style to suit everyone. Gilles Tooling levers are also popular as ergonomic upgrades with adjustable lever travel and crash damage mitigation with their folding lever. Currently only available only for OEM master cylinders.






Gilles Tooling X-Treme Brake Levers
Gilles Tooling X-Treme Clutch Levers



CRG is one of the oldest and most well known provider of clutch and brake levers. Their popular Roll-a-Click style levers are an inexpensive upgrade that enhances both comfort and looks. Every CRG lever is manufactured using a premium ball bearing to ensure smooth operation (unlike some cheap knock-offs) and available in Short / Long lengths and Gold / Grey / Black colors. Their higher end line-up also includes Folding Roll-a-Click Brake & Clutch levers and Supersport / GP replacement clutch systems (for cable clutches).

STAINLESS STEEL BRAIDED BRAKE & CLUTCH LINES
Braided Brake Lines should be the first upgrade for ANY motorcycle. Braided brake lines eliminate brake fade caused by hose expansion under heat. Imagine riding for the afternoon, speeding along at 150 mph, seeing a deer (Bambi) up ahead, grabbing the brakes...and NOTHING!!! BRAKE FADE!!! Your brakes fluid has heated up your OEM rubber brake lines and your brakes don't work properly. Save yourself and Bambi, your bike and the need for new underwear by installing a set of Spiegler or Galfer braided brake lines.

FRONT & REAR BRAKE ROTORS
Brake Rotors acts as friction material and is a core part of your motorcycle's brake system. Aftermarket brake rotors are offered in different materials to suit different riding conditions (race vs. street/touring) and have improved cooling characteristics compared to OEM. 

BrakeTech manufactures the world's most technologically advanced brake rotors! Experience better braking and longer rotor life - choose from: their flagship Ceramic Matrix Composite Rotors (featuring stealth bomber technology - superior to Carbon/Carbon rotors!), full-floating Axis/Cast Iron Rotors and full-floating Axis/Cobra Stainless Steel Petal-Style (Wave) Rotors.






BrakeTech Ceramic Matrix Compound, Iron and Steel Brake Rotors



Braking offers the largest line-up of both front and rear brake rotors. Designed and manufactured in Italy, Braking offers street and race rotors to suit all styles of riding. Their top of the line SK Race rotors are even directional for the least rotational mass and optimal heat dissipation.






				Braking Front and Rear Brake Rotors (Coming soon)



FRONT AND REAR BRAKE PADS
Brake Pads are the most often replaced brake parts and also a core component to your brake system.

Ferodo is the leader in motorcycle brake pads. Offering a full line-up of brake pad compounds for OEM, Brembo and other aftermarket calipers, achieve the optimal braking performance for your specific riding conditions.

ANODIZED SINGLE & DOUBLE BANJO BOLTS

Shipping Information

All of our shipments are sent from our US-based warehouse. US Customers pay no extra shipping, brokerage, or taxes thanks to our US Warehouse (unless we are dropshipping within California in which case, the 8.5% sales tax will apply). 
All Canadian orders are also shipped from the United States and a minimum of $29.95 shipping charge applies to all Canadian orders.

Ship-to location

We ship worldwide*! We ship within the US, Canada and internationally. Our standard shipping methods are listed below:

Within US: Fedex or US Post
US Military: US Post
Within Canada: Fedex or CanadaPost
International: US Post or other international freight forwarders

*Due to legalization issues, we are unfortunately unable to ship to Iraq, Afghanistan.


Shipping Cost

OPP cannot automate shipping costs since we have many products, many destinations and many destinations. To help our customers estimate the cost of shipping, we have prepared some tables that have estimated costs for sample products.

Estimated Shipping Costs for USA - Fedex and US Post (Updated March 2009)
Estimated Shipping Costs for Canada - Fedex and Canada Post (Updated March 2009)

Note: We are unauthorized to bill shipping costs directly to customer FedEx / UPS accounts

International customers will require individual quotes on orders.


Shipping Times & Options 

For US customers, we ship from our US warehouse. Sample shipping times are 1 day for Washington state, 2-3 days to California and 5-6 business days for New York and Florida. Hawaii is 2 day air service only.

For Canadian customers, we ship from Canadian warehouse. Sample shipping times are 1-3 days for Western Canada and 4-7 days for Eastern Canada.

International customers will require individual quotes on orders.

Please allow up to 72 hours to process your order! If you need your parts shipped sooner, please contact us via email (sales@oppracing.com) or call us at 650-871-8801 to arrange details.


Combined Shipping

At OPP Racing, we try our best to serve our customers. One of the many ways we do this is by reducing shipping costs to the best of our ability. We are able to offer low shipping costs due to the volume of shipments we send. If you are making multiple orders, please make us aware using the "Special Notes / Instructions to OPP" text field at the time of order. 

In regards to combined shipping for multiple parts & orders, we do our best to combine parts & orders whenever possible. If orders are combined, you will only be charged shipping once. Isn’t that the way it should be? You can also request combined shipping for multiple orders by specifying it at time of purchase. Just mention it to our sales staff either by phone or in the “Special Notes / Instructions to OPP” on the online ordering form, and we will do our best to satisfy your request. 


Shipping insurance

All products shipped from OPP Racing have a mandatory shipping insurance levied. Insurance is CHEAP and definitely worth it.
FedEx / UPS / Canada Post: $1 for every $100 value in parts 
US Post: $2 for the first $100, $1 for every subsequent $100 in value in parts



Tracking An Order

When your order is shipped, you will be automatically emailed a tracking number from the delivery carrier. To track your order, visit the delivery carrier‘s website (FedEx, UPS, Canada Post, etc...) and use the tracking ID number. 

Fedex: www.fedex.com
UPS: www.ups.com
US Post: www.usps.com
Canada Post: www.canadapost.ca

If you require assistance in tracking your order, please contact our sales staff at 650-871-8801

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results.

Industrial Automation: Answers for Manufacturing Productivity




The most forward-thinking companies turn to Siemens every day for answers that enable smart, fast and lean manufacturing. Driven by a nearly universal client requirement to drive process efficiency, our industrial automation solutions are rigorously engineered to:



Assess client technology and efficiency needs
Build a tailored plan that drives quick time to value
Deploy sensors to monitor manufacturing process performance
Automate processes using software, data and logic controllers





  Schlafly Hops Over Growth Limits  
With growing demand for craft brewed beer and limited expansion potential, Schlafly needed to increase output within their brewery, while maintaining the quality of their craft beer brews.
Schlafly automated brewing tasks, introduced process controls and systematically applied data intelligence using industrial automation technology from Siemens.
The brewery was able to increase process efficiency by 30%, while improving product consistency.













 The BRAUMAT process control system is based on a SIMATIC PCS 7 platform. It took over routine functions like turning on pumps and the opening and closing of valves. Those functions now happen consistently and on time – taking minutes off the average brew cycle.

The kind of transformation going on at Schlafly Bottleworks is just one example of how Siemens industrial automation solutions are helping our customers stay ahead of the competition.
















  Dependable Technology from a Trusted Partner  

Siemens industrial automation technology and deep domain expertise drives process efficiency, enables quality control and lowers operating costs. Working with clients to understand their manufacturing challenges, Siemens solutions include:


 Advanced process control technology such as SIMATIC PCS 7, which provide a solid foundation to optimize manufacturing with sensors, software and logic control mechanisms.
 Industry-specific process engineering expertise across diverse industries such as chemicals, food & beverage, glass, solar, water treatment technologies and pharmaceuticals.
 Consulting and lifecycle management services through a global delivery network of in-house experts, solution providers and OEM suppliers.
 Legacy system integration or migration projects with a focus on reducing total cost of ownership and delivering quick time to value.

Pictures of the Future: Solutions for tomorrow’s world
Advanced manufacturing and maximized production efficiency are two key topics in the spring 2013 edition of Pictures of the Future. Advanced manufacturing refers to the next generation of production planning and production engineering processes, based on a smart combination of manufacturing software with sensors, processors, and communications technology, to link the digital, virtual, and real worlds of production. The goal is to use information technology to seamlessly link the value chain all the way from product design, production planning and production engineering to the actual production process, maintenance, and service. Siemens will be an important pioneer in these flexible and efficient production processes, thanks to its leadership in integrated automation technology and related manufacturing software solutions in areas such as product lifecycle management.

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

ChristianityatHome.com - Christian Business Opportunity




























































































Christianity at Home




















Hi! Welcome to Christianity at Home







We are a Consulting Training Program for Christians



 







Request DVD & Book!

 



 



 



 




 




 


Hi there!  We’re Matt and Sarah, founders of LMS.  If you’re sick and tired of all the junky business ideas online, then this will be a BREATH of FRESH AIR!  We’re NOT affiliate marketers, network marketers, or anything you’ve seen before!  We’re a business opportunity with a mission and purpose to help believers and nonprofits which serve kingdom purposes!  Read the information below and then be sure to request our free DVD and book.  Don’t worry, we’ll even pay for the shipping and handling!



 




 




 


Read for 2 Minutes and then Request our Free DVD and Book Below! Free Shipping!

 



Christian Business? Really?
This Ad said “Christian Business Opportunity” because we are believers and our business training program is actually our ministry. Over the course of the last 12 years, our family has served in various part time positions at our local church include working with youth, children, and serving on the board of trustees. Our vision is to train believers to become entrepreneurs. And no, it isn’t “all about the money” with us! We believe these entrepreneurs will be able to use their businesses to help the local church and other nonprofit organizations which add value to the world.

 




 


Are you ready to start helping businesses and churches grow?
Yes, we said free! We’ll cover the book expense, dvd expense, and 100% of the shipping charges. The book and DVD is a BLUEPRINT to EXACTLY what we do and how we do it! I’ll send it to you free of charge and as a matter of fact, you won’t see anything for sale on our website as we know this isn’t for everyone. You see, our heart is to share our amazing breakthrough with other Christians as well. You’ll find that this is very different than anything you’ve seen before as there are no ebooks, video courses, or get rich quick products for sale on our website either!

The Business Overview

Christianity at Home is a training program for Christians who share the values of wanting to see their local church and other positive nonprofit organizations prosper. Currently, we offer free and paid training programs. These programs teach our students how to be growth and marketing consultants using our Four Step Marketing process.

How We Serve Nonprofit Organizations

We serve nonprofit organizations by offering free and paid consulting and marketing services that enable their organizations to grow. The majority of our consultants offer free consulting services to nonprofits while charging for profit organizations. Each consultant is fully trained in the process and will manage his or her own business, brand, and income. We are a training program only and use our training to help others get started in this business. 

 



 



 



 



A few more things you should know

 


This business can be run 100% from home or anywhere! And NO, this isn’t a get rich quick scheme! You’ll see that legitimate businesses take work and training. We encourage everyone to pray and seek wisdom from council before starting any business. YES, we do have a special mentoring program available. It costs some money, but to go through it you must have your family’s permissions and pass a detailed application! The majority of people use our FREE training program to help them get started. You’ll see that this is a very unique business model. In fact, we don’t know of any one else, Christian or not, that is offering a business opportunity like this.
As a reminder again, this isn’t MLM, Affiliate Marketing, or anything like that. It does take some work, but a lot less than most businesses and gives much more freedom than a 9-5 job. It does take a computer, high speed internet, and each business owner must be willing to learn our system. Thanks for visiting today, and I hope you enjoy finding more about this opportunity.  We pray God’s favor on your life and future!

 




 




 


Many blessings,
Matt, Sarah, Libby, and Mattie Kate Law

Hi Matt and Sarah – I have a question about this. Do you actually ship a real hard copy of the book and dvd program? I am curious because you only have requirements for my first name and email.  Thank you.

Matt (Admin) 
Hi Dave! Yes, we do ship out the hard copies of the books and dvds. We also send digital copies as well right away. We use email to confirm that we only ship one per household and that is why we ask for first name and email. The next page verifies shipping details.

I am a Christian but I am SKEPTICAL – You guys sound genuine but Nothing is FREE! Please expound on what it is you’re selling and the angle. Once you reply I will have a look.

Hi Lita, thank you for your comments. I have also emailed you a little bit more about us, but I’ll try to provide some clarity here for you and the others. Here is a quote from above – 
YES, we do have a special mentoring program available. It costs some money, but to go through it you must have your family’s permission and pass a detailed application! We do provide FREE training as well to many people.
 Since 2011, people have asked us for training. We have two types of training available –FREE Training & our Paid Mentoring Program. Over the years, we have sent out many books and dvds (100% free of charge) and helped many people get started with this idea. They received the resources for free and never paid us a penny. We are able to send these out for free and still make a profit on the training program because some of the people who receive our resources ask us to mentor them. 
There is nothing for sale on our website without an application because we are limited in the number of people we can provide mentoring to. That is the reason for the online application and why there is no pricing on our website. Hopefully that helps!

Matt, thank you for your reply and personal email.  I am sorry for my rude comment before. I took the dive and requested the resources. It makes more sense now that you have shared. There are just so many of these crazy scams out there now. I like what I see and I have registered for the free classes at the end of October. I pray God’s blessing on you and your family and those two cute kids of yours.

Is it me, or are there others who are not getting a confirmation email? It says that the confirmation email was sent to verify I am a real human, but I do not see the email. Just curious.

Hi Kyle and Andrea, you guys are using GMAIL – and unfortunately, you’re getting the email and just don’t realize it. Check promotions and then drag it from promotions to your inbox and you’ll be all set. The confirmation goes out immediately guys and you’ll get an email to verify your shipping, so please add us to your address book or drag us to your inbox from Gmail. Sorry for any delay.

Matt (Admin) 
We keep receiving many of the same questions/comments over the last few days so I’ll go ahead and address them as well as a few others. 
About Faith – We’ve got some hateful and genuine questions about our faith and if we are really Christians. A couple comments as well about how we’re “fleecing the flock”. Guys – the book and dvd are free of charge and we pay for shipping. Secondly, we provide a ton of free training online! I could go on, but if giving away something that helps people makes us “sinners”, then we’re guilty as charged. Yes, we are targeting believers for this business because of our vision to help the local church and nonprofit organizations. 
Various Questions – Yes, we’ll ship everything to you within 7-10 days, but you must request the dvd and book through the form above. The business model serves businesses and nonprofit organizations. We encourage your consultants to charge businesses, but serve nonprofits for free. Yes, we have references, testimonials, and more importantly, a spotless reputation online with our students and clients. Yes, we do make money if someone buys something. Yes, we do tithe to our local church. Yes, we have provided mentoring for free to many people. Yes, we have served in ministry in the past and still do. No, you should NOT buy something from me because I am a Christian. No, God probably didn’t send you here by divine appointment. You are probably here because you spend too much time on social media – LOL! Yes, we do have some free training available. No, we don’t reply to or publish rude comments. Yes, everything is explained in our free book and dvd. Yes, there are limited quantities we ship out each year. Lastly and best of all… I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do to prove my salvation on a website. That one made me laugh out loud. I almost replied to the comment with Christian lingo, but I opted to just delete it. 
Thank You Emails – Many thanks to our friends who have reviewed our information and sent us thank you emails and words of encouragement. We greatly appreciate you all and are humbled by God’s grace on our lives. Our prayer is that you will be encouraged by our story! Again, thank you all!

Dear Matt & Sarah, I have a question. I confirmed my email and was able to access the private area online. Thank you for sharing the free resources. My wife and I spent a few moments reviewing the material online but we do not see any pricing information. I feel like I would be a good fit for this but I don’t see the cost associated with the business? Can you please expound on this as we don’t want to waste your time. I did sign up for the free class in October as well.

Matt (Admin) 
Hi Matthew, I received your comment and email message yesterday as well. Your email message referenced the scholarship program as well as the costs so I’ll answer both of those questions for you. Yes, there is a scholarship program available which makes the lower mentoring program very affordable. So, there is free mentoring, the scholarship, and licensing. The reason there is no pricing anywhere on the site is that  we don’t offer special mentoring without a passing application. Programs are based upon the applicant. Once you submit your application, you can view the options available for your situation. We feel like this is the best and most honorable approach.

Important Notice– We are receiving a lot of comments right now and many of you are posting your email address and shipping addresses in the comment section. If you want the resources mailed to you, please go through the correct channels and request your book and DVD here. Please request through this system as that is how we confirm your shipping address and mail out the packages. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. We truly appreciate all of you.

I filled in the info for the DVD and book but didn’t see the bonus audio program. I had to go back to share the website of FB to get an instant download. I wanted you to know that you didn’t send me the program when I requested the book. Just so you know. Thx for doing this for the peeps of God.

Thanks Antoine, We’ve added the MP3 program to go out by email a few minutes after you request our resources. I checked and saw you got the email, but I published your comment and answered the question for the sake of everyone else. So for clarity, we added the bonus MP3 program to an email that comes shortly after you opt-in. Social shares is instant download. Either way, we appreciate you all. Thanks for all the amazing emails we’re receiving.

Laurna Adevino 
Dear Matt and Sarah, I wanted to write in and say thank you so much for putting this business model and training together. I am very excited and interested and will be scheduling a call with you as soon. I have a couple of questions for you guys. 
a. Can I run this solo as my husband isn’t an entrepreneur?
b. Can I run this part time or does it have to be full time?
c. How much can I make my first year – realistically both part time vs full time?
d. How do you charge nonprofits for your services? Do you give a discount?
Respectfully, 
Laurna
Palm Beach, FL

Sarah (Admin) 
Hi Laurna,
Thanks for your questions. I’m emailing you and publishing the comments because your questions are good. 
a. Every family has one entrepreneur. Matt is our entrepreneur. I am not. We still work together. I am part time, but many people work on their own. It just depends on your situation. 
b. Full time people make more money and learn faster. We encourage that. But there is an exception to every rule. We have had several part timers do very well with this business.
c. I asked Matt and he said that there is a wide variation based upon effort, skill, training, etc. Our revenues were $58K first year, $149K second year, and $200K 3rd year. We have balanced all of the business based upon our training program as well. Some trainees have made more and others less. It just depends I guess I’m sorry I can be more detailed. 
d. Matt has never charged a nonprofit. In fact, he is helping a new church on Thursday. When you are profitable and successful, our prayer is that you’ll share and help the local nonprofits for free. 
We pray that is helpful to you. 
Sarah

Hi Miguel! Thanks for your reply. You know what is funny is that this was Matt’s idea and the first time we shipped the packages out, I had to take them to the post office. I had two or three boxes like the picture below and I had people actually asking me if they could have one, not knowing there was just a book and DVD inside. Matt said that if the people were asking for them, then it must be a good envelope.

Dear Matt and Sarah:
Thank you for putting this together. I have been involved in many start up business ideas through the years. I have also seen dozens of business models and I have to say that this is the most organized and one of the best ideas I have seen in a very long time. I wanted to let you know that we received our package in the mail on Saturday and really love what you’re doing. We also love the vision is to help empower believers and help nonprofits. We are registered for the free training in October as well. Again, our sincerest appreciation.

Here’s a few other questions I’ve received – Yes, this business is virtual and can be run from any location in the world with internet and phone access. It is NOT limited to the USA. Yes, the book and DVD is an outline of our model and is training for the program. Yes, there is free training provided. The next class is in October. No, you don’t need to buy anything from us to learn this business and you’ll see there is no option for purchasing anything in the private area. It will take about 7-10 days to get your book and DVD. Yes, we ship real books and DVDs, but you’ll get access to digital versions as well. Yes, some information is kept private on this website due to customer confidentiality agreements that I have. We don’t publish our phone number on this website because we were getting too many calls asking us to explain the business. Our phone numbers, business information, and more proof, case studies, and testimonials are all published inside of the private area and other other websites which you’ll learn about when you request the book and DVD. 99% of your questions will be answered with the book and DVD.

Dear Matt and Sarah,
I am a nurse and was seriously injured in an automobile accident and am now unable to be hired for a nursing position.  All they see when I go to an interview is my limp and my cane.  I have been praying that God would send me a way to make some income online, as well as help other people too.  Although I cannot work directly as a nurse, my goal is to help others.  I have been duped with other work from home scams, so I pray that you are offering a legitimate way of earning an income that is legal and honest.
Thank You and God Bless,
Chloe Knudsen. BSN, RN, CPN

Hello Matt, my name is Ray and I too have a desire to start a home based business. I am a born again christian of many years
and am as skeptical as the next. I have been looking for a “work from home opportunity” many years and have tried a number of ventures.  I keep saying the same thing over and over, (there must be a legitimate opportunity on the net) but can’t find one.
   I hope and pray yours is the one!

Brian, if you don’t want the book and DVD then you don’t have to request it. Someone else will. While it is tempting to get defensive about what we are doing and the why… People can be their own judge. If you want the book and DVD, then request it. If not, no problem. There are several reasons we don’t share everything on this website, including customer privacy. However, that will make sense if you request our book and DVD. Sarah and I gives these away for free and we’re not forcing anyone here.

Hello Matt and Sarah…..I have been checking online for added income and was glad to see your info for Christians as I have left this journey up to God in my prayers.  I have read all the info and other comments.  So that I don’t waste your money and time will you answer the following for me even though I know that it will be in the info that you will be sending out.  Does this involve working with people and businesses and churches.  The reason that I ask this is that we live in a very small town of less than 200 people and 2 to 3 hours from larger towns.  Thank you and God Bless your efforts.  Joann

Hey Joan, yes it is included in the resources, but it does involve working with people, businesses, churches, etc. We are consultants and that is all covered in the book/DVD. You do not have to work with only local businesses. I have worked with clients in Seattle and the UK. It is virtual of course, so don’t worry about the small town.

If you’re seeing this page, we have books and DVDs in stock and are giving them away. We’re not trying to cause a theological debate here about business and Jesus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
