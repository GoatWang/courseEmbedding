Welcome,CrestPoint Capital Management is a professional money management firm specializing in the management of common stock portfolios.  Bond and balanced portfolios are also managed.Common stock portfolios are constructed with a highly disciplined, step-by-step process.  Portfolios generally have an average of about 100 stocks.  Portfolios are as fully invested as practical.    Portfolios following this strategy can be regarded as following a large cap core or blend strategy although each portfolio’s value/growth characteristics, industry weightings, and average capitalization size are dynamic and respond to changes in the S&P 500.  The objective of the strategy is to out-perform the S&P 500 Index by 2% per year with a similar level of risk.  Of course, no objective is guaranteed to be realized.Bond portfolios, whether taxable or tax-exempt, are constructed with maturities in the short to intermediate categories.  Bonds are used primarily as volatility dampeners in balanced portfolios and managed to be benchmark sensitive in portfolios comprised entirely of bonds.The firm offers its services to institutional clients, including employee benefit plans, foundations and endowments, and high net worth individuals and families.HomeAbout UsPhilosophyResearchProcessFor Our ClientsContact UsStriving to provide the highest level of investment performance and service to an exclusive clientele 

















CrestPoint  Capital Management Research











HomeAbout UsPhilosophyResearchProcessFor Our ClientsContact UsStriving to provide the highest level of investment performance and service to an exclusive clientele  The focus of the research effort at CrestPoint is not on individual stocks.  Little incremental benefit accrues to those seeking to consistently add value by researching what has already been over researched by a highly motivated investment community.  Besides, when stocks are combined into portfolios the importance of the specific events affecting one stock are offset to a large degree by the specific events affecting another. Diversification reduces risk because individual stocks are not perfectly correlated with each other.What remain, as a portfolio becomes more diversified, are  broader and more general types of risk factors that cannot be diversified away.  It is on the identification, measurement, and monitoring of a portfolio's broader risk factors that CrestPoint focuses its research effort.Fifty-one fundamental factors have been identified and are measured monthly for effectiveness.  Along with twenty-four industry groups, twenty are used in the firm's risk model.  These twenty have been selected as having the best relationship between factor ranking and subsequent rates of return.Portolio management is the management of risk, not return.  Using the firm's risk model, each portfolio is aligned with the risk exposures of the benchmark.   The selection of the appropriate benchmark, however, can enhance returns.  Read more.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (20.29% upside)
