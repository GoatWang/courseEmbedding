WE ARE BREAKING BARRIERS

            AveXis is relentlessly focused on bringing gene therapy out of
            the lab and into the clinical setting.
          

            We are a clinical-stage gene therapy company, dedicated to
            developing and commercializing novel treatments for patients
            suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic
            diseases. Our initial proprietary gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101,
            is currently in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment
            of SMA Type 1.
          


Get to know us











MOMENTUM IN GENE THERAPY: AVXS-101


Our proprietary gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, is in human clinical trials for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1. SMA is a severe neuromuscular disease caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1) gene, leading to the loss of motor neurons and resulting in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.

Explore our developments










The AVXS-101 Design
We’ve developed AVXS-101 to possess four key elements of an optimal gene therapy approach to SMA.








01

Recombinant AAV9 Capsid Shell is a non-replicating adeno-associated virus capsid used to deliver a functional copy of the human SMN gene across the blood-brain barrier to cells without modifying the patient’s existing DNA
 



02

Human SMN Transgene is a stable, functioning SMN gene that is introduced into the cell’s nucleus
 



03

scAAV ITR
	(Self-complementary DNA Technology)  is a human SMN transgene introduced as a self-complementary double- stranded molecule. The inclusion of this technology enables rapid onset of effect
 



04

Continuous Promoter activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained SMN expression

THE ONLY SMA GENE THERAPY IN HUMAN TRIALS
Our proprietary gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of all types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, as well as Fast Track Designation for the treatment of SMA Type 1—one of the most life-threatening neurological genetic disorders.
Decoding SMA Type 1
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disease caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene—leading to the loss of motor neurons and resulting in progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is divided into sub-categories—SMA Types 1, 2, 3, and 4—based on disease onset and severity, which generally correlate to survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels.
Our primary focus is to develop gene therapies for SMA, initially targeting SMA Type 1 and then progressively moving to other SMA subtypes. Here's why we're targeting Type 1 first:




60% of SMA patients have Type 1 WITH OBSERVATION OF DISEASE SYMPTOMS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF BIRTH




The number one genetic cause of infant death is SMA Type 1




years Life expectancy of a  child with SMA Type 1 


The Goal of AVXS-101
We believe gene therapy is a well-suited approach for the treatment of SMA due to the monogenic nature of the disease—meaning it's caused by the deletion of or mutations in a single gene. AVXS-101 is our clinical-stage, proprietary gene therapy candidate of a one-time, intravenous treatment for SMA Type 1—designed to prevent further muscle degeneration caused by SMA through:

Delivery of a fully functional human SMN gene into target motor neuron cells
Production of sufficient levels of SMN protein required to improve motor neuron function
Rapid onset of effect in addition to sustained SMN protein expression


 








4 Key Elements of AVXS-101
Discover the components that make AVXS-101 an optimal gene therapy approach.







01  Recombinant AAV9 Capsid Shell  



A non-replicating adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid is used to deliver a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient's own cells without modifying the existing DNA of the patient.
Unlike many other capsids, the AAV9 capsid utilized in AVXS-101 crosses the blood-brain barrier—a tight protective barrier that regulates the passage of substances between the bloodstream and the brain—allowing the option of intravenous administration. AAV9 has been observed in preclinical studies to efficiently target motor neuron cells when delivered via either intrathecal or intravenous administration.
The DNA contained within the capsid shell is engineered to contain the other three critical elements of AVXS-101.





02  Human SMN
Transgene  



A stable, fully functioning human SMN gene that’s introduced into the nucleus of the patient's cells is meant to supplement the cell's production of the SMN protein.
AVXS-101 aims to introduce a fully functional SMN gene to increase the patient's production of SMN protein to an adequate level.





03  scAAV ITR  (Self-complementary DNA Technology)  



The human SMN transgene is introduced as a self-complementary (sc) double-stranded molecule. The inclusion of this technology enables rapid onset of effect.
Typically, a single-stranded AAV vector must wait for cell-mediated synthesis of its complementary DNA strand to form the double-stranded DNA unit that’s required for transcription and subsequent protein synthesis.
The self-complementary modification to an inverted terminal repeat (ITR) overcomes this rate-limiting step of cell-mediated second-strand synthesis.





04  Continuous Promoter  



This unit activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained SMN expression.
The cytomegalovirus enhanced chicken beta-actin hybrid promoter that we utilize is a constitutive, or “always on,” promoter that has been observed to increase transgene expression from AAV vectors compared to other promoters.









Phase 1 Trial
The open-label study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of AVXS-101 in patients suffering from SMA Type 1. The primary outcome in the study is safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome measure is an efficacy measure as defined by the time from birth to an “event,” which is defined as death or at least 16 hours per day of required ventilation support for breathing for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperatively. Exploratory outcome measures include muscle assessment studies, measured by a patient’s CHOP-INTEND score.

AveXis, Inc. Announces Alignment with FDA on GMP Commercial Manufacturing Process for AVXS-101
Jun 14 17
AveXis, Inc. announced alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the company’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) commercial manufacturing process for AVXS-101 following the receipt of minutes from the Type B Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) meeting. This alignment includes support for the proposed commercial manufacturing process, the proposed analytical methods and corresponding qualification and validation plans – inclusive of key release assays such as potency, purity and identity – and the proposed comparability protocol, which helps assess how similar the product derived from the GMP process is to the original product used in the Phase 1 trial of AVXS-101 in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Key components of the scalable, GMP commercial manufacturing process are as follows: AveXis will continue to utilize HEK293 cells and an adherent cell line. The commercial-scale GMP process will not include the use of Hyperstacks for AAV9 vector production. The company has instead identified a novel adherent cell culture approach that can more reliably produce product and has greater surface area to potentially increase productivity relative to Hyperstacks. Additional process development improvements, both up- and downstream, were implemented to meet global regulatory GMP expectations as well as to meet projected global patient demand. AveXis plans to use the GMP process for all clinical and commercial needs moving forward, including the company’s new Rett and ALS programs. Overall, the company believes there is alignment with the FDA on its panel of analytical methods and the proposed assay qualification/validation plans. Analytical methods are used to assess how reliably and consistently the key product characteristics can be determined in order to ensure patients receive safe and effective product. In the meeting minutes, the FDA made a request that the company complete implementation of its potency assay qualification plan, presented in the meeting, prior to initiation of upcoming clinical studies. This assay utilizes the Delta 7 mouse model, which has been used historically to assess AVXS-101 potency but now incorporates additional elements to make it acceptable to global regulatory authorities. The company has already initiated the work necessary to address this request and expects to have the data ready to submit to the FDA in the August timeframe. AveXis plans to initiate a pivotal study trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 in the U.S. and a Phase 1/2a trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 2 in the U.S. later in the third quarter of 2017, pending agreement from the FDA that these data are sufficient. Additionally, FDA is aligned with the company’s proposed comparability protocol to assess the similarity of key characteristics of the Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) product, used in the Phase 1 SMA Type 1 study, with the product derived from the new GMP manufacturing process. Data from this comparability work is ongoing and will include the above-mentioned potency qualification data, which will be incorporated into the data package along with the full Phase 1 clinical data, that will be reviewed and discussed at the upcoming end-of-Phase 1 meeting, likely to be requested later in August. This meeting will help further inform the regulatory pathway options for AVXS-101. The company anticipates providing an update on the outcome of that meeting once the official minutes are available, which is anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company has previously stated that having its own manufacturing facility is a key strategic capability necessary to be successful in gene therapy. The company reported that the AveXis manufacturing facility is now fully operational for on-going GMP production. Product for the planned SMA Type 1 pivotal trials and the Type 2 Phase 1/2a trial using intrathecal delivery has been produced at the AveXis-owned facility, and will be used to initiate the trials, pending FDA review of the potency assay qualification described above and FDA agreement that designated batches of the product are appropriate for a Phase 3 clinical study. The AveXis facility will be the primary production site to meet projected commercial demand, and the company will use contract manufacturing organizations to supplement production.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					Full Description



AveXis, Inc., incorporated on March 10, 2010, is a clinical-stage gene therapy company. The Company operates through the developing and commercializing gene therapy treatments for patients suffering from neurological genetic diseases segment. The Company's product candidate, AVXS-101, is its gene therapy product candidate that is in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1, which is a genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration. The survival motor neuron (SMN) is a protein for normal motor neuron signaling and function. Patients with SMA Type 1 either have experienced a deletion of their SMN1 genes, which prevents them from producing adequate levels of functional SMN protein, or carry a mutation in their SMN1 gene. AVXS-101 is designed to deliver a functional human SMN gene into the nuclei of motor neurons that then generates an increase in SMN protein levels. The Company also focuses to develop AVXS-101 to treat additional SMA types and other treatments for rare neurological genetic diseases.AVXS-101 utilizes a non-replicating adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid. The Company intends to give AVXS-101 as a one-time treatment to restore the body's production of SMN protein to prevent further degeneration. The components of AVXS-101 include recombinant AAV9 capsid shell, which is a non-replicating adeno-associated virus capsid that delivers a functional copy of a human SMN gene to the patient's own cells without modifying the existing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the patient; human SMN transgene, which is a functioning SMN gene that is introduced into the cell's nucleus; self-complementary DNA technology, which includes introduction of human SMN transgene as a self-complementary double-stranded molecule, and continuous promoter, which is an agent that activates the transgene and is designed to allow for continuous and sustained SMN expression.The Company competes with Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., Genethon, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Biogen, Roche Holding Ltd and Novartis Corporation.

AveXis Announces Alignment with FDA on GMP Commercial Manufacturing Process for AVXS-101




















June 14, 2017 16:00 ET

 | Source: AveXis






– Agency is supportive of proposed analytical methods and comparability protocol – –  AveXis anticipates initiating U.S. SMA Type 1 and Type 2 trials in Q3 2017 with product from new process – –  AveXis manufacturing facility is fully operational for GMP product production – – Conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. EDT – CHICAGO, June  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AveXis, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVXS), a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases, today announced alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the company’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) commercial manufacturing process for AVXS-101 following the receipt of minutes from the Type B Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) meeting. This alignment includes support for the proposed commercial manufacturing process, the proposed analytical methods and corresponding qualification and validation plans – inclusive of key release assays such as potency, purity and identity – and the proposed comparability protocol, which helps assess how similar the product derived from the GMP process is to the original product used in the Phase 1 trial of AVXS-101 in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Key components of the scalable, GMP commercial manufacturing process are as follows: AveXis will continue to utilize HEK293 cells and an adherent cell line.The commercial-scale GMP process will not include the use of Hyperstacks for AAV9 vector production.The company has instead identified a novel adherent cell culture approach that can more reliably produce product and has greater surface area to potentially increase productivity relative to Hyperstacks.Additional process development improvements, both up- and downstream, were implemented to meet global regulatory GMP expectations as well as to meet projected global patient demand.AveXis plans to use the GMP process for all clinical and commercial needs moving forward, including the company’s new Rett and ALS programs. Overall, the company believes there is alignment with the FDA on its panel of analytical methods and the proposed assay qualification/validation plans. Analytical methods are used to assess how reliably and consistently the key product characteristics can be determined in order to ensure patients receive safe and effective product. In the meeting minutes, the FDA made a request that the company complete implementation of its potency assay qualification plan, presented in the meeting, prior to initiation of upcoming clinical studies. This assay utilizes the Delta 7 mouse model, which has been used historically to assess AVXS-101 potency but now incorporates additional elements to make it acceptable to global regulatory authorities. Specifically, the agency stated, “We believe that your potency assay development and qualification plans have the potential to result in an acceptable potency assay, and we are encouraged that the assay includes reference controls that allow for calculation of relative potency and that the assay qualification will include 3 independent runs. However, we do not have enough information to predict the feasibility of your plans.” The company has already initiated the work necessary to address this request and expects to have the data ready to submit to the FDA in the August timeframe. AveXis plans to initiate a pivotal study trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 in the U.S. and a Phase 1/2a trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 2 in the U.S. later in the third quarter of 2017, pending agreement from the FDA that these data are sufficient. “The goal of the CMC meeting was to align with FDA on our commercial manufacturing process, analytical methods and comparability protocol, all three of which we believe were achieved in this collaborative and constructive discussion,” said Sean Nolan, President and Chief Executive Officer of AveXis. “The team has already made progress toward addressing the FDA’s request regarding potency assay qualification, and we anticipate only a modest impact to timelines. We are pleased with the outcomes of the meeting and the progress we have made at the AveXis facility, and, most importantly, believe we have a scalable GMP commercial process in place to fulfill future patient demand and a path forward to potentially utilize the Phase 1 data in our regulatory pathway.” Additionally, FDA is aligned with the company’s proposed comparability protocol to assess the similarity of key characteristics of the Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) product, used in the Phase 1 SMA Type 1 study, with the product derived from the new GMP manufacturing process. Data from this comparability work is ongoing and will include the above-mentioned potency qualification data, which will be incorporated into the data package along with the full Phase 1 clinical data, that will be reviewed and discussed at the upcoming end-of-Phase 1 meeting, likely to be requested later in August. This meeting will help further inform the regulatory pathway options for AVXS-101. The company anticipates providing an update on the outcome of that meeting once the official minutes are available, which is anticipated to be in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company has previously stated that having its own manufacturing facility is a key strategic capability necessary to be successful in gene therapy. The company today reported that the AveXis manufacturing facility is now fully operational for on-going GMP production. Product for the planned SMA Type 1 pivotal trials and the Type 2 Phase 1/2a trial using intrathecal delivery has been produced at the AveXis-owned facility, and will be used to initiate the trials, pending FDA review of the potency assay qualification described above and FDA agreement that designated batches of the product are appropriate for a Phase 3 clinical study.The AveXis facility will be the primary production site to meet projected commercial demand, and the company will use contract manufacturing organizations to supplement production.

About SMASMA is a severe neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. SMA is caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene that codes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. The incidence of SMA is approximately one in 10,000 live births. The most severe form of SMA is Type 1, a lethal genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and associated muscle deterioration, which results in mortality or the need for permanent ventilation support before the age of two for greater than 90 percent of patients. SMA Type 1 is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. About AVXS-101AVXS-101 is a proprietary gene therapy candidate of a one-time treatment for SMA Type 1 and is designed to address the monogenic root cause of SMA and prevent further muscle degeneration by addressing the defective and/or loss of the primary SMN gene. AVXS-101 also targets motor neurons providing rapid onset of effect, and crosses the blood brain barrier allowing an IV dosing route and effective targeting of both central and systemic features. About AveXis, Inc.AveXis is a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing treatments for patients suffering from rare and life-threatening neurological genetic diseases. The company’s initial proprietary gene therapy candidate, AVXS-101, is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of SMA Type 1. For additional information, please visit www.avexis.com.
