Roller Board Wall Mounting Bracket
Roller Board Wall Mounting Bracket from David Scott Company. We  offer a full line of Patient Shifters and Roller Transfer Boards and each are available in a variety of sizes.  Within our Patient Transfer Boards we offer units with Rollers as well as Roller-Free. Some of the benefits to Roller Free Roller Transfer Boards is that they offer lateral transfer without the need for lifting. This reduces the number of injuries to your staff’s backs as no lifting is required. Patients will not be disturbed, annoyed or frightened. Some of our covers are available as anti-microbial and Anti-static and are MRI compatible.
Roller transfer boards in general are designed to assist staff members with patient transfer and allows effortless patient transfer from any two combinations of the following: hospital bed, gurney, operating room table, X-ray table and cast table. Our Roller Boards with rollers have smooth operating rollers which make transfer of patients easy.
Roller Board Transfer Boards
All of our Roller Boards includes a cover and replacement covers are available as well. In addition we offer Stainless steel roller board rack that will fit almost all manufacturers’ boards and will mount easily on a wall or door for convenient storage of boards is also available.  Our Full length patient transfer devices also known as Shifter Boards are available in 2 different sizes.
We offer a  full length 72″L x22″W x 3/16″H and a half size 34”L x 23”W x 1/8” . Patient shifter boards decrease transfer risk and helps keep your staff and patients safe while transferring patients from a stretcher to an OR table or bed. Features include ten built-in hand holes for easier maneuvering. The hand holes double as openings to hang your patient shifter board.
Shifter Boards
Uneven transfers are trouble-free because our patient shifter board can bridge small gaps. These are constructed with extra durable material for extended life. Our patients Shifter boards are made in the USA from slick coated polyethylene for a smooth-sliding surface that facilitates easier transfers and can be stored on the wall with our DSC-WHPS adjustable wall hanger.

                        Great company 
October 30, 2013


Reviewer:

                  I prefer innovative mounts over any other company out there. Largest selection of mounts and parts, lowest amount of vibration. Very good product.

        They do the work nicely
If you need something to rest your heels on your bike, these are Perfect ! Because of my bike's geometry I was having problems to rest my feet/legs while riding on the bike.

They seemed to be design for the foot controls I have; nice materials. The only fail are the bolts. Either they should come with pins and locks or button-socket head screws, obviously stainless steel.

I'm going to be dragging the shift pegs I put on. Let's have fun!

        Best Foot Rest
Actually heel rest. But, this item acts in conjunction with foot rest and makes like having floor boards. Easy to install but need to pay attention to the picture as well as the instructions. When opening the package be sure to not lose the little black set screws. Adjust how you want your heel to rest on the peg before final tightening of the screw. It also would have been nice if the bolts that came with the product matched the bolts that mounts the foot pegs. Star (torx) vs. hex head. But, I can switch with the passenger foot pegs. I also liked the adjustability angle. I placed the heel rest in the upper position. Great quality chrome. Looks GREAT too!!

        Excellent
What a difference. Makes the ride so much more comfortable. Reduces the lean, but I'm used to that having a lowered bike. You won't be disappointed.

            What exactly makes these heel rests compatible only with certain forward controls but not with passenger footpegs or mid controls?
        
Asked by: martin88



            Can I use HD Peg 50500-03 using peg 34608-95 with HR 50227-01
        

            I have a 2009 Sporty XL1200C and have HD peg 50500-03 installed, I would like to install the HD heel rest 50227-01 with shifter peg HD 34608-95. Will this work on the Sporty. I've seen this combination in a picture and it's what I'm looking for instead of a full floorboard. I have medical issues and need the support of the heel. Everyone thanks for any help you could provide this old guy. Riding 52 years.... YES I'm a Sporty Guy.... Always have been.
        
Asked by: Charby



            Do you offer these in black?
