In fact, each machine tool we manufacture and each control feature we develop is designed with customer profitability as the top objective. While there are numerous reasons to choose Hurco, the high level benefits of Hurco CNC machine tools are highlighted below.​

Content2A Broad Line of CNC Mills for a Variety of Applications 
Whether you own a small job shop, you're a tier one supplier to the big automotive or aerospace companies, you supervise a tool room at a large company, or you’re a startup pursuing a dream, one of our CNC machining centers will fit your needs and your budget. We have more than 20 machining centers designed to provide the flexibility you need for a wide range of applications.
 
From 5-axis and 3-axis VMCs to the two and three-meter double column machines, horizontals, and specialty zone machines, Hurco has a CNC mill that will make your operation more productive and profitable.
 

Design Expertise + Manufacturing Excellence + Premium Components
Delivering machining centers that are rigid and reliable is a given. Our manufacturing team is relentless when it comes to quality and attention to detail. Like you, they take pride in what they do.  So, you can count on your Hurco CNC machine to last. 
 
All of our machine design is conducted in the USA using both static and finite element analysis in addition to reliability analysis. The Hurco team is skilled at user-centric design that results in ergonomic machine tools, which means you don’t have to crouch, bend, squint, or curse while you’re working at the machine. Even better, the efficient design promotes flexible manufacturing, allowing you to schedule a wide variety of jobs. All of our machine tools are manufactured at our wholly-owned facilities, which gives us complete control from design to manufacture of our rigid CNC machining centers.
 
What you can’t see does matter. Not only do we use high quality components, such as larger linear rails for increased rigidity and accuracy, we have strategic alliances with companies that are the best at what they do--companies such as Yaskawa, Rexroth, and FAG Bearings. Since we don't simply source components, these partners collaborate with us during each phase of design to ensure we manufacture the best machine tool in the most efficient manner.

No Other Control Gets You from Print to Part Faster
The CNC part of the CNC machining center is what sets us apart from every other builder. While we’re proud of the iron, it’s the control technology that makes our customers more profitable. If you're new to Hurco, there are three main points you need to know about our control. 
Our control supports NC and conversational equally well.  While we're known for our conversational programming, the NC side of our control is as good as any in the industry with complete compatibility with the most utilized CAM systems and comprehensive FANUC integration.
Each feature has a measurable benefit. Each feature we integrate into our software must give our customers a benefit that is measurable--reduce redundancy, decrease programming time, optimize machining time, improve surface finish. For example, UltiMotion is a feature that significantly improves surface finish while reducing cycle time by as much as 30%. 
Easy to learn. Easy to use. We have the most intuitive user interface and logical software in the industry, which means less training time and less frustration. Hurco invented conversational programming and we have continually led the industry to advance control technology so it lets machinists be more productive.
Read more about the Hurco control ›› "The Hurco is simplistic to the point that it makes anybody productive—anybody. And that's rare…it's rare to have a machine tool that is that user friendly. I don't know any other machine that has a control where you can pull down the file and a half-hour later have a form. You can be mediocre in math, mediocre in geometry, and make a good product in no time." ––Jon Heckman, DePuy Orthopaed
Read more  
One-2-One Service + Support
Our service team is the best in the world. Complete control of design and manufacturing means there is one source of accountability. You won't need to contact multiple companies to get the help you need. Additionally, our one-stop total customer care system supports our stellar service team so they can get their job done efficiently. If you have a problem, we make it right. Period. Read more >>
“Hurco has the best service network I’ve seen during my 40 years in the industry. It’s really something you should promote.––Dave Bernhardt, Nucon. 

Hurco CNC Machining Centers Make Our Customers More Profitable
As a company that has been leading the industry in CNC machining technology for more than 40 years and has been awarded more than 80 patents, we understand the importance of agility, adaptability, and profitability when it comes to running a business. Fortunately, our financial stability has enabled us to continue developing new control technology features and expanding our product line as scheduled even during the worst economic conditions. Our founder invented conversational, and our team of software engineers continually focuses on developing features that slash setup time and make programming easy so you can get down to the business of making chips. But we don’t stop there. The NC side of our control is just as good as any you’ll find. With features like NC/Conversational Merge,  you can do 3D parts with holes or patterns in a single setup. 
 

Customer Corner
At Hurco, it’s not just us preaching about the quality of the iron deliver and our advanced control technology, our customers tell us and everyone else! Their endorsement is more meaningful than any advertising campaign.
"One thing that impressed me about the Hurco early on is the way they are built. They are built beefy."––Jon Heckman, DePuy Orthopaedics. Read the case study
“We run these machines hard and they never give us a problem."––Mike Baker, CNC Specialty. Read the case study
"The VMX42SR was rigid enough to handle the weight of stainless."––Dave Bernhardt, Nucon. Read the case study

The diagram below illustrates the unique advantage of the Hurco CNC machine control. It is the most versatile control in the industry: equally powerful whether you choose to use the conversational blue path or the NC programming green path. But it doesn’t stop there. Hurco’s patented UltiMotion software provides fast, smooth cutting to get your parts out the door quickly. 
Whether you own a job shop, you’re just starting your business, or you are in charge of a high production operation for a big company, the integrated control of our machine tools will prove to be a powerful asset. 
Nobody gets a part concept from your mind to finished metal part faster. That’s Mind Over Metal. That’s Hurco.

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

Captain Brian Collins
New Orleans Paddlewheels



"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”
