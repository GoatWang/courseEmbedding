Describe what you have done, what you are doing, and the kinds of things you are interested in.









Achievements






Led cross-functional team through launch stages of $35M new product development project for next generation critical care bed and the most comprehensive product transition in company history. New product has revenue of over $110M and is experiencing consistent double-digit growth in a no-growth hospital bed market.  Additionally, successful execution led to world-wide on time delivery at commercialization, an avoidance of a 6-month product gap and a reduction in product SKUs by a factor of 50, which reduced supplier costs, simplified manufacturing and shortened lead times.  Processes and templates incorporated into company-wide new product development best practices.
