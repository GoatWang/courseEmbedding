‘Rachael Ray Show’ Episode Guide (April 22): Tony Gonzalez; Baby Products Tested

Line Spacing+-
AFont Size+-









 


Posted by Michael Hoffman on April 22, 2015






On today’s all-new episode of the syndicated “Rachael Ray,” former Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons star Tony Gonzalez and his wife, October, stop by the program to co-host the program with Rachael. Plus, Tony’s mother Judy also makes an appearance to spill secrets about her son!
Next, the “Human Lab” segment returns with three moms who put products that claim to help their babies with bath time, bedtime and bottle time to the test. 
Products featured in today’s “Human Lab” segment include the Piyo Piyo Shampoo Shower Cap (claims to prevent soap/shampoo from getting into your baby’s eyes), The Beebo (claims to hold your baby’s bottle in place), and The Baby Shusher (which claims to soothe your crying baby by emitting soothing sounds).
Then, mother-of-three Rachel Hollis, whose bikini photo went viral last month, visits the show to encourage a fellow mom to wear a bikini for the first time in 10 years.
And later, Rachael prepares a Korean-style beef bowl with brown rice.
Anyone with a huge appetite for fun is invited to take a bigger bite out of life this year with the hottest daytime show on television, “Rachael Ray.” The Emmy Award winning daily, one-hour, syndicated show is among the top ranked daytime programs on television.
This season, Rachael continues to bring her warmth and no-fuss approach to life into the homes of millions of viewers with her signature quick meals, celebrity surprises, provocative topical discussions, cutting-edge musical performances, and groundbreaking features.
“Rachael Ray” is distributed and produced by CBS Television Distribution in association with Harpo Productions, Scripps Networks and Watch Entertainment. Janet Annino is Executive Producer. CTD is a unit of CBS Corp.
To watch the nationally syndicated “Rachael Ray,” be sure to check your local listings for the time period it airs in your market.
