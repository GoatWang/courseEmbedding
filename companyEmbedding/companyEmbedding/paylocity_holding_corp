Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY) Cut to Hold at Zacks Investment Research

					Posted by Tristan Rich on Jul 21st, 2017 // No Comments 




Paylocity Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:PCTY) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a research note issued to investors on Wednesday. 
According to Zacks, “Paylocity offers cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions to medium-sized organizations. We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. For the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line. Such initiatives should also drive its forthcoming results. Also, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, specializing in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players remains a major headwind. Notably, Paylocity has underperformed the broader market in the last one year.”

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  582.00 (07/27/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.08      Market Cap $2.47 B     Shares Outstanding 51.51 M     Public Float 25.74 M     Yield PCTY has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.14      Net Money Flow ($)  229,352    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Paylocity is a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software solutions for medium-sized organizations.
History[edit]
The company was founded as Ameripay Payroll Ltd. by Steve Sarowitz in 1997.[1] It was renamed Paylocity in December 2005.[1][2] As the company grew, it relocated from Franklin Park, Illinois to Elk Grove Village, and to its current location in Arlington Heights. The company has leased 309,000 square feet of office space in the current headquarters of Zurich Insurance North America in Schaumburg,Illinois. The move will be complete in 2019.[3]
It was one of the 5,000 fastest growing private companies according to Inc. Magazine in 2003, 2004, and from 2007 to 2014.[4] The company was also included in the Deloitte Fast 500 as one of the fastest growing technology companies in 2013,[5] 2014,[6] and 2015.[7]
Paylocity successfully executed an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2014, raising over $82 million.

History[edit]
The company was founded as Ameripay Payroll Ltd. by Steve Sarowitz in 1997.[1] It was renamed Paylocity in December 2005.[1][2] As the company grew, it relocated from Franklin Park, Illinois to Elk Grove Village, and to its current location in Arlington Heights. The company has leased 309,000 square feet of office space in the current headquarters of Zurich Insurance North America in Schaumburg,Illinois. The move will be complete in 2019.[3]
It was one of the 5,000 fastest growing private companies according to Inc. Magazine in 2003, 2004, and from 2007 to 2014.[4] The company was also included in the Deloitte Fast 500 as one of the fastest growing technology companies in 2013,[5] 2014,[6] and 2015.[7]
Paylocity successfully executed an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2014, raising over $82 million.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
