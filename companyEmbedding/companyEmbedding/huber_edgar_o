Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill., Aug. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Sears Holdings (Nasdaq:    SHLD) announced today that Edgar O. Huber has joined the company as CEO and President of Lands' End.  Mr. Huber is responsible for driving growth and profit opportunities for Lands' End, as well as continuing to drive the culture that provides customers with the quality, value and service that the brand has long been known for.  He was most recently executive vice president, Global Business Development for Liz Claiborne, Inc. 


"One of the tenets of the cultural transformation we are building at Sears Holdings is that everything begins and ends with the customer, something that has been a hallmark of Lands' End's business for the nearly 50 years of its existence.  I am confident that Edgar will not only be a strong steward of that history, but given his deep background in retailing and brand building both in the U.S. and abroad, that he will be able to grow the business and find new ways to delight Lands' End's customers," said Lou D'Ambrosio, Sears Holdings' chief executive officer and president. "Edgar is a proven leader of branded products and I'm delighted to welcome him to our highly talented Lands' End team."
"Lands' End is a leading multi-channel retailer, but more than that, it's become a brand that millions of customers have come to put considerable trust in," said Mr. Huber. "I'm so excited to be joining the team in Dodgeville as we work to give our customers the service and quality that they've come to know for generations."
Mr. Huber comes to Sears Holdings from Liz Claiborne, Inc. where prior to his most recent position, he served as president and CEO, Worldwide, Juicy Couture from 2008 to February 2011.  Prior to that, Mr. Huber served in a variety of increasingly senior roles at L'Oreal where he oversaw a portfolio of brands including Ralph Lauren Fragrances, Giorgio Armani Beauty, Diesel Fragrances, Lancome, Shu Uemura, and the Kiehl's Since 1851 brand.  In this role he was directly responsible for leading the luxury products group in more than 30 of L'Oreal's most important markets in Europe and Russia.  Huber, who in his 15 years with L'Oreal previously served as president of luxury products, L'Oreal USA, began his career as a brand manager.
Mr. Huber will be based at Lands' End's home office in Dodgeville, Wis.
