PRIVATE CLIENTSAsset managementTECHNOLOGY & BANKING SERVICES



Private Clients

                    Each relationship starts with a conversation




	Every client’s story is different. Each one is unique.

	We invest significant time to understand your very personal circumstances. We do this for all our clients, who come from increasingly diverse backgrounds: entrepreneurs; corporate executives; family businesses spanning several generations; and younger generations adjusting to newly received family assets.

	The service we offer is bespoke, not one-size-fits-all. And it starts with a question.

	What do you want to achieve with your wealth?

	We believe in a long-term, holistic approach to wealth management that takes into account your investment horizon, risk tolerance, family situation and how actively you wish to get involved. We can also integrate your non-financial assets, such as real estate, business interests, or art into our analysis.

Asset management





Lombard Odier Investment Managers is the asset management business of Lombard Odier, focused on institutional investors, third-party distributors and financial intermediaries. Lombard Odier has always been wholly owned and managed by its partners who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the firm.
	This independent structure means that we are able to focus 100% on our clients rather than shareholders. And our size and focus means that we can respond with agility to market events.


Our 111 investment professionals have an average of 16 years industry experience. We have over 300 staff operating from 13 offices worldwide.

Our investment pillars
	Successfully exploiting the investment opportunities created by market dislocations requires skill and experience. We believe that to achieve this consistently over the long term also requires independent thinking and a specialist approach.  For us, this specialist approach involves focusing on those investment strategies where we believe that we can add real value for our clients.

	 





Fixed Income
We are in a new paradigm in fixed income markets presenting significant challenges for investors and asset owners. Our full range of fixed income strategies and solutions in developed markets, emerging markets and corporates have been designed to meet these challenges. 
			Read more




Convertibles
For investors allocating to the compelling benefits of convertible bonds, we are a natural choice. Lombard Odier Investment Managers is a market leader in convertible bonds with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions managed by an experienced team. 
			Read more




Equities
Our high conviction approach is characterised by our dedicated investment teams’ desire to thoroughly research each company or issuer within the investment universe and to know the factors that influence their returns. Our high conviction equity capabilities span core regional strategies in emerging markets, Europe and Switzerland as well as global thematic strategies.  Our systematic equity capabilities apply an innovative factor-based approach offering diversified and well-balanced multi-factor exposure in key regional allocations such as US, Europe and Emerging Markets. 
			Read more




Multi-asset
We believe that focusing on investors’ outcomes and applying a risk-based asset allocation is key to achieving better diversification, capital protection and stable long-term performance.  In our view, clients’ objectives should be clearly defined in terms of desired outcomes and should be translated into a risk budget, rather than targeted returns. 
			Read more




Alternatives
Our Alternative investment teams target returns that are uncorrelated to market cycles and free from any systematic factors.  We also manage less liquid strategies which are designed to benefit from an illiquidity premium and aim to provide long-term protection from inflation. 
			Read more




Impact Investing
We are committed to preserving the long-term interests of our clients. This commitment also extends to our employees and the communities with which we operate.  As a pioneer in this field, we believe in the power of investment to bring about positive, social and environmental change is folded into our company history, as we strive to offer our clients financial and social returns without compromise.

How will Brexit shape Britain’s relationship with the continent?

Does Brexit really signal the end for globalisation?


By John Arlidge
Wednesday 21 September 2016



contact us

 The world changed forever on 23 June 2016, when the British public voted to leave the European Union (EU) after more than 40 years. The immediate fallout was extreme: global stock markets tumbled, while the pound plummeted to a 31-year low. Much of this initial reaction has since been reversed, with European stock markets including the FTSE 100 rebounding to pre-referendum levels. But with years of exit negotiations ahead, the Brexit effect is far from over.

 Following are just two views on what is an extraordinarily multi-faceted subject. The picture may still be developing but it’s already time to “rethink Brexit”.
Brexit Globalisation








The UK’s historic vote to leave the European Union opened debate in all parts of the world on the cracks in the philosophy of a European community. What impact does Brexit still to have on our markets? 

 Globalisation is good. Or, rather, it used to be. Britain’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union is making many rethink the liberal economic order.

 Many Britons voted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc in protest at the free movement of people and money that they blame for impoverishing them and making it harder for them to find school places for their children and hospital appointments for their family.

 Their action has encouraged others. Most notably in Europe and the US, where antipathy towards globalisation crosses the political spectrum.

 As isolationist sentiment grows, its impact is beginning to be felt in the markets. One of the reasons why sterling fell in value by around 10% after the Brexit vote in June is that investors believe Britain will be a less competitive economy outside the integrated EU economy and the Eurozone. Beyond Europe, figures from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) show that export growth among developing countries fell to a meagre 1.3% in 2014 - a precipitous decline from more than 30% in 2010.

 In July 2016 the IMF slashed its forecast for global trade growth for the umpteenth time. This year will be the sixth year in a row that world trade has been flat or falling as a share of the global economy - after decades when trade was rising faster than the world economy and the engine of prosperity for emerging market economies.

 Small wonder that many are now calling time on an economic order that has endured since the latter half of the last century. Martin Wolf now questions whether capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible.

 capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible

 The good news for those who believe that free global trade is a long-term net win for trading partners and for global prosperity is that, while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world, others are forging ahead.

 while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world, others are forging ahead

 WTO figures show that while overall export growth among developing countries may be slowing, trade between developing nations is rising sharply. Some 52% of developing countries’ exports went to other emerging economies in 2014 up from 38% 20 years ago. Trade between China and India was $1.7bn in 1997. By 2014 it had reached $72bn India’s total trade with Africa grew more than 60% in only four years, to almost $48bn in 2014-15

 Chinese companies invested $111bn around the world in 2015 - more than ten times the amount in 2005, figures from the American Enterprise Institute show. The total that Indian companies have invested abroad - $139bn in 2015 - has risen 43% in the past five years.

 What’s more, there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade. French - yes, French - Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron has resigned from the government. The 38-year-old former investment banker is expected to run for the presidency under a pro-integration, pro open markets banner. Polls in France show also support for EU rising since Brexit vote. In the Spanish general election, that took place just after the Brexit referendum, support for the mainstream centre right rose, while the radical fringe lost support.

 Perhaps the shock of Brexit has given the supporters of globalisation just the jolt they needed. It is some - small - comfort for “Bremain” supporters if their loss turns out to be globalisation's gain.

  Samy Chaar on Brexit


By Jessica Bown
 Wednesday 21 September 2016

Lombard Odier’s Chief Economist Samy Chaar believes the short-term impact of the Brexit vote on global stock markets has already been erased, but that the ongoing uncertainty is a serious risk. What impact has the result of the European Union (EU) referendum had on European stock markets?

What impact has the result of the European Union (EU) referendum had on European stock markets? 
 Global markets all went down on the morning after the vote. However, if you look at any European index now, they are all trading back at above June levels. In other words, the effect has been completely erased.

What impact do you expect it to have longer term?
 Europe currently provides 50% of foreign investment into the UK, so Brexit could be a real game changer for the UK economy. European markets may also be affected if other EU countries vote to leave the union, but this seems unlikely at this stage.

Does Brexit threaten London’s status as a financial hub?
 The short answer is yes. Of the 400 major banks in the City, more than two thirds are foreign, and a big chunk are there to operate in Europe. However, cities such as Paris and Frankfurt are not ready to replace London as Europe’s main financial hub. So it is not the end of the City as we know it.

Do you believe Brexit will have political ramifications elsewhere in the world?
 Internationally, anti-establishment sentiment is pushing people towards political extremes. But while there is exasperation with the EU in other European countries, these countries have stronger ties to the union, not least because they have the euro. Even in Italy, there is little appetite to return to the lira.

What do you expect to happen to UK interest rates?
 Short term, I do not expect UK interest rates to change. However, sterling has taken a hit and the UK has very little manufacturing. The higher cost of imports will therefore drive inflation, creating another problem for the Bank of England.

What effect will Brexit have on real estate in the UK?
 Lower interest rates are good news for property investors – and the depreciation of the pound acts as a cushion. But the prime London property market is dependent on investment from Europe, Russia and the Middle East. So there is vulnerability, especially as these properties are so overvalued.

What are the biggest risks facing investors during the exit negotiations?
 Uncertainty is the undoubtedly the biggest issue for investors at this time. It’s going to be a long process and, for the UK, a lot depends on the economic model put forward by Theresa May. We should have a better idea of what she is planning after the Autumn Statement on 23 November 2016.

What can investors do to protect themselves against the risks linked to Brexit?
 Investors should think on a global scale and seek exposure to countries that will not be impacted by this issue. Emerging markets are one example of this. They are volatile, but could provide a 6% yield. Our view is to have a well-balanced portfolio that preserves your capital and gives you a little something on top.

What investment opportunities may arise from Brexit?
 One possibility is that, as the balance of power in Europe shifts, the Eurozone – rather than the EU, which is bigger and less flexible – will wield greater international power.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.
