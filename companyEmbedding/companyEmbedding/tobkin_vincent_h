Vincent H. Tobkin new chairman of the board at Tellabs








May 2, 2013






































The board of directors at optical transport equipment vendor Tellabs has elected Vincent H. Tobkin as chairman of the board. Tobkin succeeds Michael J. Birck, Tellabs' co-founder and chairman, who has retired due to health reasons (see “Birck, citing cancer, to step down as Tellabs chairman”).  Tobkin has served as a Tellabs director since 2010. He was a senior advisor, retired director, and global telecom/technology practice leader of Bain & Company from 1992 to 2009, general partner and founder of Sierra Ventures from 1984 to 1992, and a partner and consultant with McKinsey and Company from 1976 to 1984.  The stockholders, meanwhile elected Tobkin, Alex Mashinsky, Gregory J. Rossmann, and Mikel H. Williams as Class III directors. They will serve as Tellabs directors through 2016. Mashinsky is a new Tellabs director.  A proposal to declassify the Tellabs Board failed to muster enough votes to pass.
