 								Martin M. Van Brauman (pictured, at left) is the chief legal officer of a Dallas-based company called Zion Oil and Gas Inc., which right now is boring a hole 18,000 feet below the surface of semi-arid farmland in Israel, intent on finding oil. While the company's obvious goal is to strike oil, its real mission is to use its petrochemical profits to launch two international charitable foundations once funds start flowing.
