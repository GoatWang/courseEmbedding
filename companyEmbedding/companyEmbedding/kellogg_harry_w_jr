Dr. John Harvey Kellogg
        and Battle Creek Foods: Work with Soy

        by William Shurtleff
        and Akiko Aoyagi
        
A Chapter from the Unpublished Manuscript, History of Soybeans and Soyfoods, 1100 B.C. to the 1980s

        ï¿½Copyright 2004 Soyinfo Center, Lafayette, California





      One of America's great nutritional pioneers,
      John Harvey Kellogg, was also one of the first Americans to realize the
      great potential of soy in human diets. Kellogg developed America's first
      meat analogs, which became the prototypes for all the many soy-based meat
      analogs subsequently developed by Adventist companies such as Madison
      Foods, International Nutrition Laboratory, Loma Linda Foods, Worthington
      Foods, and a host of others. Kellogg also developed the first acidophilus
      soymilk. His writings and teachings on diet and health, as well as on
      soyfoods, affected the lives of hundreds of thousands and had a strong
      impact on most of America's early Seventh-day Adventist soyfoods pioneers,
      as described in the following sub-chapters.
Early Life and Health Teachings.
      John Harvey Kellogg was born in Livingston County, Tyrone Township,
      Michigan, on 26 February 1852, the fifth of twelve children. His parents
      were newly converted Seventh-day Adventists. In 1856 the family moved to
      Battle Creek, Michigan. From ages 12 to 16 John learned the printing trade
      by working with Ellen and James White at the Adventist Review and
      Herald Press. The Whites soon saw in this young man great drive and
      energy, a genius for organization, a keen and enquiring mind, and a
      persistent interest in the principles of preventive medicine, diet, and
      health. A few years later they decided to sponsor him through medical
      school. After initial study at the Hygeio-Therapeutic College run by
      pioneer health reformer Russell T. Trall at Florence Heights, New Jersey,
      Kellogg studied for a regular one-year term at the University of Michigan
      Medical School. He later transferred to Bellevue Hospital Medical College,
      then recognized as the nation's leading medical school, from which he
      received his MD degree in 1875. In his graduation thesis entitled
      "What is Disease?", he attempted to show that most disease,
      rather than being considered an enemy, should be thought of as a helpful
      warning from the body attempting to correct a natural function that had
      become "deranged." And pain should be thought of as a prompting
      to the sufferer to stop violating the natural laws of good health
      (Schwartz 1970; Johns and Utt 1977).
After graduation Kellogg returned to
      Battle Creek and in 1876, at age 24, he became physician-in-chief, in
      charge of the Western Health Reform Institute, which the Whites and the
      Adventist church had founded in 1866, based on Ellen White's health reform
      vision of 1865 and on a meeting with Dr. James Caleb Jackson. Jackson, a
      health reformer in Dansville, New York, ran a similar successful natural
      healing center. Kellogg remained closely connected with the institution
      for 67 years. He promptly renamed it Battle Creek Sanitarium (or San for
      short). The term "sanitarium" had first been used in England as
      early as 1851, but Kellogg gave it a new meaning: "a place where
      people learn to stay well" (Schwartz 1970). He then set out to
      eliminate meat from the Sanitarium dining room. To do so he worked closely
      with his wife, Ella Eaton Kellogg, to establish a special research kitchen
      in about 1877 to develop a wholesome and tasty vegetarian cuisine. Here he
      developed America's first meat analogs (meatless meats). Dr. Kellogg
      worked tirelessly to build the sanitarium into the largest and most
      progressive medical institution of its type in America, and the birthplace
      of modern dietetics. Dr. Kellogg took editorial control of a magazine that
      had started in 1866 as the Health Reformer, renamed it Good
      Health, and used it for many years to promote the sanitarium, his
      ideas on healthful living, and later his many food products, including
      soyfoods.
As the fame of Dr. Kellogg and Battle
      Creek spread, it became a mecca of health seekers, a social center . . .
      the place to go. Many famous people flocked to partake of its natural
      cures and vegetarian diet. Among Dr. Kellogg's patients were William
      Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryan, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Alfred
      Dupont, J.C. Penny, Montgomery Ward, Lowell Thomas, Thomas Edison, Henry
      Ford, George Bernard Shaw, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and many others. Soon
      Dr. Kellogg's views on diet and health spread across America and around
      the world.
Dr. Kellogg made a continued effort to
      deepen and update his medical knowledge. He read the major French and
      German medical journals, developed an extensive personal medical library,
      and traveled to Europe in 1883, 1886, 1907, and 1911, each time to enhance
      his medical and surgical education by studying with top specialists in
      various medical fields.
In Dr. Kellogg's day, before Pasteur's
      germ theory of disease had come to be widely accepted, the standard
      treatment for most common diseases was "Bleed them, purge them, and
      drug them." The purging was with calomel and the drugging with
      arsenic, opiates, mercury combinations, prussic acid, or antimony. Some
      felt that more died of the cure than of the disease. Doctors were largely
      unaware of the therapeutic value of diet; they tended to class it (as many
      still do) with fads and foolishness.
Opposing the popular cures of the day,
      Dr. Kellogg expanded on Ellen G. White's teachings to develop a holistic
      approach to natural healing and healthful living that he called
      "Biologic Living." His first love was his mission to promote the
      "Gospel of Health," which included a simple grain-based
      vegetarian diet, exercise, hydrotherapy, fresh air and sunshine, good
      posture and dress, good mental health, and, when unavoidable, expert
      surgery. Biologic Living was preventive medicine at its best and its
      keystone, Kellogg felt, was proper diet. Dr. Kellogg strongly opposed the
      use of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, caffeine, sugar, narcotics, meat, and
      strong or hot spices. He disapproved of the use of eggs and grudgingly
      accepted the use of small amounts of milk and freshly-made cheese. However
      he heartily approved of yogurt and by 1909 became one of the first
      Americans to sell it and promote its use. He supported the vegetarian diet
      for both health and humanitarian reasons. He felt that taking life of any
      kind tends to brutalize human instincts and, in effect, accustom man to
      sanctioning violence and murder. Dr. Kellogg favored a low protein diet,
      which he believed increased resistance to disease, increased longevity,
      and contributed to greater physical and mental endurance. Excess protein,
      he felt, placed too great a strain on the kidneys and liver, and led to
      the accumulation of toxins in the intestines. Dr. Kellogg was a strong
      proponent of preventive medicine. Before his time many people believed
      that disease was a result of divine judgment or chance, but not personal
      habits and diet. Most people initially found it difficult to accept the
      germ theory of disease: how could such minute organisms as germs actually
      be dangerous?
Dr. Kellogg, himself, was living proof of
      the value of his teachings on diet and health. Although he was small in
      stature (5 ft. 4 in.; 163 cm) and had had his left lung destroyed by
      tuberculosis before he was 20, Kellogg was a dynamo of human energy, a
      personification of the work ethic, who needed only 4 to 5 hours of sleep a
      night, went cycling or jogging every morning, dictated 25 to 50 letters a
      day, adopted and reared 42 children, wrote nearly 50 books, edited a major
      magazine, performed more than 22,000 operations, gave virtually all of his
      money to charitable organizations, loved human service, generally
      accomplished the work of ten active people, and lived in good health to
      age 91. Most who knew him considered him a many-sided genius. Always a
      doctor, he had the rare ability of communicating to every patient the
      impression that their case was his number one concern.
Early Health Food Products. As
      part of the Sanitarium's vegetarian diet, Dr. Kellogg wanted to develop a
      healthful breakfast to replace the standard American ham (or bacon) and
      eggs. Since he regarded cereal grains as the basic food in a healthful
      diet, he wanted to include them in the breakfast menu in a convenient,
      ready-to-eat form. America's first successful cold breakfast cereal,
      brand-named Granula and made entirely from wheat, had been developed in
      1860 by Dr. James Caleb Jackson, the health reformer mentioned above. In
      about 1877 Kellogg developed a similar product from a mixture of several
      well-baked grains and called it Granola. Dr. Jackson had developed a
      coffee substitute called Somo; Dr. Kellogg made a similar Caramel Cereal
      Coffee from a mixture of roasted bran and molasses. (He later developed
      other coffee substitutes.) Dr. Kellogg initially made these two new foods
      in the experimental kitchen only for Sanitarium patients. Soon, however, a
      mail order business developed from former patients and others interested
      in health reform, and in 1890 Dr. Kellogg organized the Battle Creek
      Sanitarium Food Company as a subsidiary of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. In
      a little wooden building Dr. Kellogg started America's first health food
      factory and the first of many similar Adventist health food companies.
      Battle Creek, took its first step toward becoming the "Breakfast Food
      Capital of the World." (From 1902 to 1906 forty breakfast cereal
      companies were formed in that one county in Michigan.) In 1892 Dr. Kellogg
      developed what was probably America's first peanut butter and added it to
      his product line. He did not attempt to patent it, since he felt it was
      something that everyone should have access to. In 1894 he developed and
      patented America's first flaked cereal, his rolled-wheat Granose Flakes.
      His younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg, did much of the work in
      developing, producing, and marketing these new breakfast cereals. In 1898
      the Kellogg brothers (primarily Will Keith??) developed the first corn
      flakes, but soon a rift developed between the two. W.K. first used the
      word "Kellogg's" as a brand name, first added sugar to the
      corn-and-malt flakes, set up his own plant in 1906, and went on to make
      the product famous in America, promoting it into a multi-million dollar
      business. (A similar lucrative business based on Dr. Kellogg's food ideas
      was launched by C.W. Post who had shown intense interest in the
      experimental kitchens while a patient at the Sanitarium. In 1895 he
      started marketing Postum coffee substitute, in 1898 Grape nuts breakfast
      cereal, and later Post Toasties.) Many court battles ensued between J.H.
      and W.K. over the use of the Kellogg name; the doctor lost. This made him
      change the name of his company in 1921 to the Battle Creek Food Company.
Another serious rift developed between
      Dr. Kellogg and the Adventist church leaders, who felt he was losing touch
      with the spiritual dimensions of Adventist work and turning the Sanitarium
      (which he rebuilt on a grand scale after it was destroyed by fire in 1902)
      into a luxurious amusement center. Moreover the pantheistic philosophy
      expressed in his book The Living Temple (1902) was considered
      heretical. Dr. Kellogg felt that "the ministers and preachers
      discouraged health reform by their example and, moreover, had no business
      meddling in medical affairs." In 1907, after protracted conflict, Dr.
      Kellogg broke his ties of fifty years with the Adventist church; he
      retained control of the Sanitarium and health food factory. The Sanitarium
      was in its heyday from 1915-1930, but business was hurt by the Great
      Depression and it went into receivership in 1933.
During the early years of developing
      breakfast cereals, Kellogg also began to develop meat substitutes. In
      about 1895 or 1896 he received a letter from Dr. Charles W. Dabney, USDA
      Assistant Secretary of Agriculture and a noted agricultural chemist,
      suggesting that he undertake the preparation of a "vegetable
      meat" and that the navy bean might be suited for this purpose. At the
      time Kellogg was also concerned with providing enough protein for people
      giving up meat, so he set to work on the project. In 1896, the same year
      Ellen White made her call for an alternative to meat, he produced
      America's first meat analog or "meatless meat," which he called
      Nuttose (MacIvor says Protose was first??) and served as a main dish in
      place of meat at Sanitarium meals. Nuttose was a peanut-based cutlet made
      by grinding the nuts to a smooth paste, mixing with water to form an
      emulsion, thickening with flour or starch, then steaming or retorting
      until set. It could be seasoned to taste like beef, veal, chicken, or
      salmon, and served sliced or diced (Schwartz 1970). By July 1900 Kellogg's
      Sanitas Nut Food Company had an advertisement in the magazine Good
      Health selling Protose (a meat analog), Bromose, Malt Honey, Nut
      Butter, Malted Nuts (a milk substitute of ground almonds and peanuts in
      emulsion with malt syrup), and Maltol. Protose, combining peanuts and
      wheat gluten, became Kellogg's most popular product, with several thousand
      tons having been consumed by 1930. (Dr. Kellogg later noted that at the
      time he was developing his early meat analogs, he had not heard of
      soybeans.) A chart in the January 1904 issue of Good Health showed
      that the Battle Creek Sanitarium Co., Ltd. was now producing Protose. By
      December of that year Nuttolene, a pate, was also being produced. By 1906
      Sanitas Meat was sold in 1-pound cans. In December 1908 the first ad for
      Nuttose appeared. By March 1909 Kellogg was producing nine commercial meat
      analogs. None, however, yet contained soy. During the early 1940s
      Kellogg's laboratories developed additional meat analogs such as Battle
      Creek Steaks, Battle Creek Skallops, and meatless wieners, each made from
      varying combinations of nuts (mainly peanuts), wheat gluten, and natural
      flavorings . . . but still containing no soy. At about (when??) the same
      time he was testing meat substitutes, Dr. Kellogg predicted, looking at
      the rapidly expanding population, that eventually Americans would not be
      able to afford the luxury of feeding 20 pounds of grain to a steer in
      order to get 1 pound of meat.
In 1898 Harry W. Miller, who would
      eventually become one of Kellogg's most famous students, enrolled in
      medical school at the newly-opened Adventist-run American Medical
      Missionary College at Battle Creek. By leading guided tours in the
      Sanitarium Food Company to help pay his way through college, Miller began
      to learn more about meat analogs and how they were made. A student in
      several of Kellogg's small classes, Miller was also deeply influenced by
      Kellogg's dynamic personality and by his teachings on diet and health.
Early Writings About Soyfoods. The
      first mention of soybeans by Kellogg (or by any Adventist) appeared in
      1917 in his book The New Method in Diabetes in which he stated in
      passing that "The soy bean is a remarkable legume . . . and highly
      valuable food for diabetics." He then gave its nutritional
      composition. In the 1919 edition of the same book he gave two recipes for
      using soybean puree in soups and one soybean salad. In 1920 in The
      Health Question Box or A Thousand and One Questions Answered he
      devoted five pages to soyfoods, including a detailed discussion of tofu
      and its preparation and a clever method for quick cooking soybeans at home
      without the use of a pressure cooker as follows: soak the beans overnight,
      put them into a small crock (the type with a self-sealing lid in which
      apple butter was sometimes sold), add a little salt plus water to cover,
      seal tightly, set in a pot containing a saturated salt solution, and boil
      over high heat for 2 hours. The outer salt solution boils at above 104ï¿½C
      (220ï¿½F) rather than at 100ï¿½C (212ï¿½F), thus reducing the cooking time.
      By 1923 Dr. Kellogg was aware of the writings on soybeans of C.V. Piper
      and William Morse (The Soybean), Shih Chi-yien of China, and
      various other researchers. In The New Dietetics (1921), his best
      book on diet and nutrition, he devoted seven pages to soyfoods including
      discussions of soymilk, tofu, soy sauce, and soy sprouts. He now
      recognized the great role that soy had played in Oriental diets.
Starting in March 1921 Dr. Kellogg began
      to run articles about soyfoods in his monthly publication Good Health,
      which had a large circulation. This was one of the first US magazines to
      teach people about soyfoods. Articles (some of which were reviews of
      scientific journal articles) included "The Soy Bean in Chinese
      Cookery (March 1921, by Effie Funk Muhse, 7 p., including detailed
      information on the production of tofu, soy sauce, soy sprouts, and soy
      oil), "Food Value of the Soy Bean" (Aug. 1923, 1/8 p. including
      mention of soymilk and tofu), "The Dietary Value of the Soy
      Bean" (April 1927, 1/3 p.), "Better Food Values for Smaller
      Expenditures" (June 1927 by A.A. Horvath, 11/4 p.), "Soy Bean
      Milk" (Sept. 1928, 1/8 p.), "Chinese Babies Thrive on Milk from
      Beans" (Dec. 1928, 1/2 p.), and "A Soy-Bean Preparation for
      Infants" (Dec. 1929, 1/4 page).
During the 1930s the number of articles
      about soyfoods in Good Health increased, the tone became more
      enthusiastic, and Dr. Kellogg began to write some of the articles himself.
      In the December, January, and February issues of 1930 he serialized his
      8-page speech titled "Soybeans as Human Food," which he had read
      to the American Soybean Association (11 Sept. 1930). Subsequent articles
      included "The Soybean an Excellent Source of Food Lime" (Dec.
      1932, 1/2 p.), "The Mischievous Colon Bacillus" (April 1933, 3/4
      p.), "Benefits from Acidophilus Milk" (Jan. 1935, 1/2 p.),
      "Wide Usefulness of the Soy Bean" (Oct. 1935, 1/2 p.),
      "Babies Thrive on Soy Bean Milk" (Jan. 1936, 1/2 p.), "The
      Alkalizing Power of the Soy Bean" (Jan. 1936, 1 p.), "Increasing
      Use of the Soy Bean" (Feb. 1936, 1/3 p.), "Soy Beans Versus
      Beef" (July 1936, 1/3 p.), "Usefulness of the Soy Bean"
      (July 1936, 1/3 p.), "Hope for the Farmer in the Soy Bean" (Oct.
      1936, 1 p.), "The Great Future of the Soy Bean" (Dec. 1936, 1
      p.), "Bread of Soybean and Wheat" (May 1938, 1/2 p.), "A
      Special Milk for Bottle-Fed Babies" (June 1938, 1/2 p.), "Germany
      Turns to the Soy Bean" (Aug. 1938, 2/3 p.), "The Soybean a
      Blessing to Mankind" (Jan. 1939, 1 p.). Soyfood were also mentioned
      in many other smaller articles not cited above, and in articles continuing
      into the 1940s.
Both Dr. Kellogg and his brother Will
      Keith Kellogg were widely in demand as public speakers. Both spoke at the
      annual meetings of the American Soybean Association (ASA). At his speech
      to the ASA in 1927 (Ref?? not in proceedings??), W. K. discussed the place
      of soy in human diets, saying: "Some day people in the United States
      will realize how foolish it is to feed 100 pounds of soybeans to livestock
      and get back a very small poundage of meat products, which have a protein
      inferior to the protein fed to the livestock." He also talked about
      soymilk.??
In September 1930 Dr. J.H. Kellogg spoke
      to the ASA about "Soybeans as Human Food." This was an excellent
      and comprehensive 20-page speech, containing many references to scientific
      studies on soyfoods, and indicating Kellogg's deep interest in and
      knowledge of soyfoods. He concluded: "It is evident that a plant
      possessed of such superlative values and such astonishing versatility and
      adaptability should receive far more serious attention than has heretofore
      been given it by the agriculturists of this country . . . There can be no
      doubt that it is destined to play a large part in the feeding of America's
      millions . . . "
By the early 1930s soyfoods had become
      one of Kellogg's major interests. It is known that Henry Ford was at least
      a guest of Dr. Kellogg's at Battle Creek, perhaps a patient. There has
      been speculation that Kellogg got Ford interested in textured soy
      proteins. In a letter to Mrs. Ford of 20 February 1932, Kellogg said that
      should the Fords visit his facility, there were a number of things that he
      would like to speak with them about, including a "vegetable
      meat." With the letter he included a sample of the meat analog he had
      developed. There is no response to the letter in Kellogg's files. In April
      1937 Kellogg sent Ford a telegram asking for an interview. He explained in
      a subsequent letter that the bankers and large financial interests were
      trying to get control of his Battle Creek Sanitarium and Battle Creek Food
      Company. He also explained that he had made some discoveries related to
      foods from soybeans that he was sure Mr. Ford would like to know about.
      Shortly thereafter Kellogg's problems cleared up and the two never met at
      that time.
Dr. Kellogg had first mentioned soy in
      the 1917 edition of his book The New Method in Diabetes. In the
      extensively revised 1933 edition of this book he greatly expanded the
      section on soyfoods, giving a recipe for homemade soymilk prepared from
      freshly ground soy flour, plus four pages of instructions for making
      cultured Soy Acidophilus Milk at home.
Starting in 1936 there was a great
      increase in Dr. Kellogg's interest in soyfoods as indicated by his
      frequent mention of them in articles and in correspondence. In that year
      he exchanged numerous letters with William Morse (described later). He
      wrote Dr. A.A. Horvath in 1936 concerning soymilk. In a letter to Horvath
      of 13 August 1937 Kellogg invited him to visit Battle Creek and concluded
      saying "I am thoroughly convinced that the soybean is the most
      wonderful food product ever grown and that it must have been of
      immeasurable service to the Chinese." (Horvath had lived in China for
      many years studying soyfoods.) Kellogg also frequently wrote Admiral
      Richard E. Byrd, who was using soy acidophilus milk on his US lecture
      tour.
On 5 October 1937, Dr. Kellogg presented
      a major paper on soyfoods before the food and nutrition section of the
      American Public Health Association; it was entitled "Special Health
      Values of the Soybean." He pointed to the long history of soyfoods in
      the diets of people in East Asia, and stressed the high quality of their
      protein, the easy digestibility of their fat content, and the fact that
      they contained all the known vitamins except C.
Development of Early Soyfood Products,
      Soy Meal and Soy Acidophilus Milk. Prior to 1927 Dr. Kellogg and the
      Battle Creek Food Company began to market their first soyfoods. The first
      was a soybean meal (actually, probably a soy flour) made from heat treated
      fresh press cake and containing 53.8% protein and 9.2% fat. It was claimed
      to be "adapted to American culinary methods by a simple process,
      which improves the flavor and digestibility without impairing the quality
      of the choice of protein, which gives it its chief value." Kellogg
      purchased this soy meal or flour from the A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. He also
      sold a special soy biscuit for diabetics that contained 50-60% protein,
      7-10% fat, and 1-3% starch (Horvath 1927).
Dr. Kellogg had long been interested in
      the virtues of fermented milks and the problems with cow's milk. As early
      as 1895 he had written an article entitled "Milk as a Food Unsuited
      to Adults," in which he stressed the various dangers of cow's milk
      and recommended a product called Kumyzoon (produced by his Sanitarium
      Health Food Co.) in which the milk lactose had been replaced by lactic
      acid. No mention was made of soymilk. In an 18-page pamphlet "Cow's
      Milk as a Cause of Disease" (1896), Kumyzoon had been replaced by Lac
      Vegetal, a milklike beverage made of ground almonds. The July 1901 issue
      of Good Health magazine contained a full-page ad headlined
      "Cow's Milk Kills Babies"; it promoted the milk substitute
      Malted Nuts produced by Kellogg's Sanitas Nut Food Co. In the November
      1924 issue of Good Health, Kellogg wrote that cow's milk forms
      tough, large curds in the infant's stomach. The September 1928 issue of
      Kellogg's magazine Science and Health had a short article on
      soymilk in Italy. His first??
In the early 1900s, Dr. Kellogg learned
      of the work of Metchnikoff and Tissier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris
      that seemed to show that Nature protects us by providing friendly flora,
      especially Lactobacillus acidophilus, to guard the intestines. Many
      intestinal problems seemed to respond to Acidophilus Therapy, whereby the
      culture was consumed regularly as a way of changing the intestinal flora.
      Although Dr. Kellogg was not the first to produce Acidophilus Milk, he was
      the first person in America to practice Acidophilus Therapy for combatting
      colitis and various forms of intestinal and digestive disorders, and he
      probably did more to advance this therapy than any other person. By 1909
      his food company was selling dairy yogurt and in 1911 he wrote an article
      about its use in the treatment of intestinal disorders. In 1912 he
      received samples of a special strain of L. acidophilus from Tissier,
      whom Kellogg credited with having devised a successful method for changing
      the intestinal flora. He began experiments using this in dairy milk.
By 1930 Dr. Kellogg was making his first
      soymilk at Battle Creek and serving it to some of his patients. Confirming
      earlier reports by Fischer (1914) in Germany on soymilk and other
      vegetable milks, he found that "It is digested more easily than cow's
      milk. The curds formed in the stomach are smaller, less gastric juice is
      required, and gastric digestion is completed sooner." He did not
      feel, however, that the product was of good enough quality to market it
      commercially. Dr. Kellogg, personally, drank soymilk regularly at
      mealtimes, often mixing it with a little cow's milk to improve the flavor.
      In 1937 he stated that his typical breakfast while he was living in
      Florida consisted of a glass of soymilk and a banana; he then ate only two
      meals a day.
By April 1933 Dr. Kellogg had discovered
      that L. acidophilus grew much better in soymilk than in cow's milk.
      He isolated a particular strain, which he called Soy Acidophilus; when
      grown in soymilk it produced 5 to 10 times as many organisms per unit
      volume as its counterpart grown in cow's milk--3,000 million to 5,000
      million per gram of cultured soymilk. Moreover the soy acidophilus
      organisms were more than twice as large, more hardy, and less easily
      damaged by temperature changes. The culture retained its potency for 3 to
      4 months, then slowly diminished. Armed with his exciting new discovery of
      an easy way to produce much larger quantities of very hardy L.
      acidophilus than had formerly been possible using cow's milk, Dr.
      Kellogg greatly expanded his research on using Acidophilus Therapy to
      change the intestinal flora; this soon became a key concept in his total
      therapeutic approach. When he examined the intestinal flora of infants, he
      found that the flora of healthy nursing infants was 90-100% L.
      acidophilus, whereas that of sick infants having dark and bad-smelling
      stools was only 10-20%. Changing the intestinal flora by simply feeding
      the sick infants Soy Acidophilus Milk seemed to cause the beneficial L.
      acidophilus to suppress putrefactive and pathogenic bacteria by
      producing lactic acid, which the undesirable bacteria could not tolerate,
      and also by crowding them out. Dr. Kellogg was soon stating that,
      "Every bottle fed baby should receive a teaspoonful of Soy
      Acidophilus Milk at each feeding as a protection against bowel
      troubles." Acidophilus therapy was also found to work well on adults
      in treating colitis (taken orally or by enema), toxemia, duodenal ulcers,
      gastric ulcers, constipation, and intestinal gas and infections.
In 1934 Dr. Kellogg was issued a patent
      on his Method for Making Acidophilus Soybean Milk (US Patent No.
      1,982,944, Dec. 4). He was issued a British patent on 22 January 1936.
On 28 May 1934 the famous Dionne
      quintuplets were born in Callander, Ontario, Canada. Four months later,
      Dr. Kellogg happened to read that Marie, the youngest of the quints, was
      suffering from a severe bowel infection. Immediately wiring the quints'
      physician, Dr. A.R. Dafoe, Kellogg announced that he was sending him a
      supply of soy acidophilus milk, which he was certain would cure the
      problem. About ten days later he received a letter from Dr. Dafoe
      indicating that the cultured soymilk had indeed corrected the infection
      almost immediately, and requesting that a continuous supply be sent for
      the five little girls. The quints began by taking 1 teaspoonful of the Soy
      Acidophilus Milk at each feeding. By 1937 they were each taking 1 pint a
      day and remaining in good health, although whenever the use of the Soy
      Acidophilus Milk was discontinued, the bowel trouble quickly returned. Dr.
      Kellogg theorized that one cause for the susceptibility to this infection
      was that, because they had never been breast fed, they had never received
      the protective bacteria on the surface of the nipple, which most infants
      normally ingest while nursing. Dr. Kellogg tried for several years to
      obtain permission to use a picture of the quints on his product to promote
      its sales, but with no success.
In 1934, delighted with the results he
      was finding in his soy acidophilus treatments, Dr. Kellogg wrote
      (where??):


We are making increasing use of soy
        acidophilus with splendid results. I am sure it is very much superior to
        ordinary acidophilus milk as a means of changing the intestinal flora.
        Soymilk seems to greatly stimulate the growth of acidophilus, whereas
        cow's milk is such an unfavorable medium that prolonged training is
        necessary . . . A slow growing, dying milk culture, when placed in
        soymilk, springs into rejuvenescence at once, producing a good quality
        of cultured milk in less than 24 hours. It seems evident that a medium
        which exercises such a stimulating effect on the growth of acidophilus
        in vitro ought to be equally superior in the intestines. We find it of
        special value in old cases of toxemia in which the conditions are so
        unfavorable that the intestinal acidophilus has entirely disappeared. In
        such cases the soy acidophilus will reimplant the normal acidophilus
        flora within a week or two after other measures employed for months or
        even years have utterly failed.

In 1935 Dr. Kellogg reported that between
      1912 and 1935 over 100,000 gallons of acidophilus milk (both soy and
      dairy) had been used in the treatment of patients at Battle Creek
      Sanitarium. From March to December 1936 The Battle Creek Food Co. ran a
      series of full-page ads in Good Health for Soy Acidophilus Milk. By
      April of that year the Sanitarium was using 200-250 gallons a week of the
      Soy Acidophilus Milk, and it was reported to be more popular with the
      patrons than cow's milk. In August 1936 Good Health published a
      recipe for Soy Acidophilus Ice Cream, made from the cultured soymilk. In
      October Dr. Kellogg began to make extensive use of ripe bananas with Soy
      Acidophilus Milk; the combination was found to be particularly effective
      in eliminating putrefactive bacteria from the intestinal tract. In late
      1936 Dr. Kellogg set out to develop a powdered soymilk, which people could
      order from him, together with his culture, to produce their own fresh Soy
      Acidophilus Milk at home. His fresh cultured milk, which he claimed
      resembled human milk more than cow's milk, contained 3.6% protein and 1.5%
      fat. Its biggest marketing drawback was its short shelf life, requiring
      that it be shipped direct to customers.
By February 1937 Dr. Kellogg had
      developed both a powdered soymilk and a Soy Acidophilus Cheese. Made from
      Soy Acidophilus Milk, the cheese resembled cottage cheese, but contained
      as much as 250,000 million L. acidophilus organisms per gram!
      Samples of both products were sent to Dr. Dafoe to give to the Dionne
      quints. By 1937 Soy Acidophilus Milk was being produced commercially by
      Kellogg's Battle Creek Food Company in Battle Creek, Michigan, and by Home
      Milk Producers Association in Miami, Florida, a group connected with the
      Miami-Battle Creek Sanitarium that Kellogg had established in 1930. An
      excellent 9-page brochure describing its nutritional composition and
      curative properties was published by Battle Creek Food Company in 1937. In
      March 1940 Dr. Kellogg patented Soy Acidophilus Concentrate (Ref??) and
      wrote a brochure describing its virtues. Although Dr. Kellogg never
      developed his Soy Acidophilus Milk to its full potential (he was too busy
      with a thousand other things), it nevertheless continued to sell well
      commercially until the mid-1950s; it was probably his most original
      contribution to soyfoods development.
Later Soyfoods Developments. From
      the mid-1930s, Dr. Kellogg exchanged numerous letters with William Morse
      in which he asked Morse to send him samples of soybeans that yielded good
      soymilk and asked for Morse's comments on a sample of condensed soymilk
      Kellogg had produced. In March 1936 he told Morse that he was using a ton
      of soybeans a week to make soymilk, was experimenting with a dry
      evaporated soymilk, and also planned to plant 150 acres of soybeans for
      canning. He commented: "I consider the soy bean one of the most
      remarkable of the world's food products and expect to make increasingly
      large use of it." Morse wrote Kellogg the same month that he had seen
      a nice sample of dry evaporated soymilk produced by Dr. Harry Miller in
      China.
A photograph taken in 1936 of soyfood
      samples in William Morse's office showed the following Battle Creek
      products in commercial form: Soy Acidophilus Milk (in a quart bottle with
      the subtitle "A New and Highly Efficient Means of Changing the
      Intestinal Flora"), canned Soy Bean Flour (Low in Starch), canned
      Wonder Soy Beans (Baked), and canned Soy Gluten Bread (For the Diabetic).
In 1937 The Battle Creek Food Company was
      marketing Soy Acidophilus Milk, Soy Beans, Fresh Green Soybeans, and a Soy
      Gluten Biscuit, consisting of equal parts soy flour and wheat gluten,
      probably for diabetic diets. With the push to use more soyfoods during
      World War II and with Dr. Kellogg's growing interest in diabetic diets,
      the number of soyfoods grew. On the 1940 price list were: Soy Acidophilus
      (1-pint bottle; note the new name; 6.25% soy solids), Soy Beans, cooked
      (10 oz. can), Soy Beans, green (19 oz. can), Soy Gluten Wafers (3 l/2 oz.;
      42% soy), Soy Flour (1 lb. or 4 lb. bag), Soy Gluten Bread (canned), Soy
      Kee (16 oz.; 100% soybean roasted coffee substitute), Soy Milk (condensed
      10-ounce can), and Soy Spread (8-oz. can). Dr. Kellogg also developed a
      Soy Meat, canned Protose with a soy filler, a product he hoped to be used
      in the rations of the US army guerrilla unit, because it needed no
      refrigeration.
In 1942 The Battle Creek Food Company
      began to market its first commercial soymilk, brand-named Soygal. It was
      said to be excellent for those allergic to cow's milk and to have a little
      beany flavor. Apparently it was not very successful, as it was soon
      dropped from the product catalog.
In 1943 Dr. Kellogg developed his first
      soy-based meat analog, Soy Protose, which contained 32% soy. Other
      Adventist soyfoods pioneers such as T.A. Van Gundy and Madison Foods had
      produced soy-based meat analogs in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1944 a malted
      product was added to the line. But after World War II, interest in
      soyfoods dwindled. The 1955 price list contains only three soy items; Soy
      Acidophilus (1-pint bottle), Soy Flour (2 lb. or 5 lb.) and Soy Flakes (5
      oz.). In 1959 Soy Beans were added back. The only soyfood in the 1960
      catalog was soy flour. In 1960 the entire assets of the Battle Creek Food
      Company, including the patents on various soy-based meat analogs, were
      acquired by Worthington Foods, which, in 1981, was the world's most
      important producer of soy protein-based meat analogs.
Will Keith Kellogg, of Corn Flakes fame,
      did some work with soy during the 1940s. In 1945 he developed Kellogg's
      Corn-Soya, a flaked breakfast cereal. It was being distributed nationwide
      by 1947.
Dr. Kellogg died of pneumonia on 14
      December 1943 at age 91. (His brother W.K. also died at age 91.) Yet over
      the years Dr. Kellogg's influence on the world of soyfoods continued to
      grow, especially as the meat analogs he had first developed grew in
      popularity. At an early date, his ideas and recipes were picked up and
      creatively adapted to new soy products by Dr. Harry Miller, Jethro Kloss,
      Madison Foods, Loma Linda Foods, Worthington Foods, and many Adventist
      sanitariums and small food companies in America and overseas. He was the
      grandfather of a host of prosperous soyfoods lineages, many of which are
      with us today.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
