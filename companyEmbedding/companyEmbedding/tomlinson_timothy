                           From the beginning of human civilization, people have depended on plants to cure disease, promote healing of injuries, and
                              alleviate pain. In many places that has changed very little. In the West, however, herbal and botanical cures have long been
                              ignored in favor of "scientific medicine." But the benefits of medicinal plants are being rediscovered in many developed countries,
                              where consumers are turning to such therapies in place of, and in addition to, Western medical treatments. And, all over the
                              world, the drive to lower the cost of health care has made herbals and botanicals an attractive alternative to more expensive
                              synthetic remedies. In 1978, the World Health Organization responded to increased interest in medicinal plants by convening
                              a series of international consultations, seminars, and symposia to explore and promote the use of medicinal plants. Medicinal
                              Plants presents the proceedings of the last of these symposia, held in 1993. It brings together an vast range of information
                              and presents an overview of the use of medicinal plants that includes a discussion of a variety of issues-scientific, economic,
                              regulatory, agricultural, cultural-focused on the importance of medicinal plants to primary health care and global health

How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Tennessee, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.
