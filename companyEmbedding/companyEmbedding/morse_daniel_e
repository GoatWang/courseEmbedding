BiographyDr. Morse received his B.A. in Biochemistry from Harvard, his Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and conducted postdoctoral research in molecular genetics at Stanford University. He was the Silas Arnold Houghton Associate Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Harvard Medical School before joining the faculty at UCSB. Honored by Scientific American as one of the top 50 technology innovators of 2006 for his development of bio-inspired, kinetically controlled routes to semiconductor thin films and nanoparticles, Morse was the 7th Kelly Lecturer in Materials and Chemistry at the University of Cambridge and the 3M Lecturer in Chemistry and Materials at the University of Vancouver. Elected a Fellow of the AAAS and the Smithsonian Institution, he received a Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health, a Faculty Research Award from the American Cancer Society, and honors as Visiting Professor of Bio-Nano-Electronics in Japan and as Visiting Professor at the University of Paris and universities in Singapore and the UK. His students have received international recognition and awards in numerous symposia and international research meetings.
Research DescriptionFrom our discoveries of the molecular mechanisms controlling biomineralization, we developed a novel bio-inspired method for the low-temperature, low-cost catalytic nanofabrication of a wide range of semiconductors and ferroelectrics. Because this method gives access to structures and activities not attainable by conventional methods, we are exploring the resulting nanostructured materials for improvements in high-power batteries, uncooled IR detectors and information storage. We are pursuing our discoveries of the remarkable molecular and cellular mechanisms of tunable photonic materials in squids, and applications of these findings for electro-optics, IR detectors and improvements in solar energy conversion. Our discovery of an unanticipated mechanism underlying the genetically encoded self-assembly of proteins and their resultant emergent properties guides our studies of KLH, a giant copper-containing protein used as a potent regulator of the immune system and a carrier for anti-cancer vaccines.

                           OBIECTIVE: To characterize the molecular mechanisms by which marine invertebrate larval chemosensory receptors and their associated
                              signal transducers regulate surface attachment and metamorphosis of the larvae in response to chemical signals from the environment;
                              and To characterize the molecular mechanisms regulating the activation of specific gene expression in the developmentally
                              arrested marine invertebrate larva, in response to chemical inducers of metamorphosis. We have found that metamorphosis in
                              larvae of the marine mollusc, Haliotis rufescens (red abalone), is controlled by exogenous chemical signals recognized and
                              transduced by two convergent chemosensory pathways: a morphogenetic pathway activated by a GABA mimetic peptide morphogen
                              encountered by the larvae on surfaces of recruiting (host) algae, and a regulatory pathway stimulated by lysine in seawater.
                              The system displays both habituation, acting at the level of the morphogenetic pathway receptors and facilitation, mediated

                           This study will develop a conceptual model of leadership based on an analysis of leadership functions. In broad outline, I
                              will argue that an essential function of a leader is to develop and maintain social bonds among group members. In fact, I
                              will conclude that this is a function of paramount importance, which has been neglected by most research. I will argue that
                              analysis of the bond-building function can provide significant insight into the nature of leadership, regardless of context.
                              The specific features of social bonds and how they are developed and maintained will vary in different groups and situations,
                              but an essential leadership function in every case will be their development and maintenance. Such a model would be readily
                              open to empirical confirmation, would provide theoretical insights into leadership processes within groups, and would have
                              useful practical consequences for leadership development and training as well

                           Although marine fouling is initiated, in several cases, by the accretion of a thin molecular and microbial layer (microfouling),
                              it is the attachment of larger organisms (macrofouling) that is responsible for the principal increase in drag on vessel hulls,
                              increase in fuel consumption, stress and deterioration of piers, pilings and cassions, and the reduced efficiency of heat-exchangers
                              in the marine environment. Virtually all marine organisms that contribute to macrofouling are recruited to immersed surfaces
                              as larvae (or propagules) setting from the plankton. The objectives of research supported by this contract have been: (1)
                              to identify and characterize the biochemical signals, receptors, and their mechanisms of action, that control the settlement,
                              metamorphosis, and recruitment of larvae of marine invertebrates onto surfaces, and thus control marine fouling; and (2) based
                              on these results, to identify new strategies for countermeasures that are specific, non-toxic, and environmentally safe. Keywords:

                              The worlds of biology and biotechnology have found their way into the development of vital technologies that will have a positive
                                 impact on Soldier performance. This is being accomplished through the basic and applied research efforts of investigators
                                 within the Army's Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies (ICB). The ICB was established in 2003 and operated on behalf
                                 of the Army at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                                 (MIT), the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and partners in industry. The ICB is one of only a few Congressionally
                                 chartered University Affiliated Research Centers designed to facilitate and accelerate the transition from discovery to development
                                 and implementation. Through its own research and its strategic collaborations and alliances with Army laboratories; research,
                                 development and engineering centers (RDECs); and industrial partners, the ICB provides the Army with a single conduit for
                                 developing, assessing and adapting new products and biotechnologies in direct support of Army missions. The Army needs addressed
                                 by the ICB include research and development (R & D) improvements in the fields of advanced sensors, materials synthesis, power
                                 and energy, information processing, network analysis and neuroscience. The ICB's mission is to use the tools of modern biotechnology
                                 to discover the mechanisms responsible for the remarkably high performance of complex biological systems and translate these

                              Biological systems fabricate multifunctional, high performance materials at low temperatures and near-neutral pH with a precision
                                 of three-dimensional nanostructural control that exceeds the capabilities of present human engineering. Using the tools of
                                 biotechnology and genetic engineering, we discovered the unanticipated mechanism of simultaneous catalysis and templating
                                 governing the nanofabrication of silica in a biological system. We then translated this mechanism to develop a new biologically
                                 inspired, low-temperature, low-cost route for the synthesis of silica and a wide range of silicones, organic polymers and
                                 nanostructured metal oxide, -hydroxide and -phosphate semiconductor thin films without the use of organic templates. This
                                 new synthesis method is generic, yielding more than 30 different inorganic thin films and nanostructured, bimetallic perovskite
                                 ferroelectrics. Because kinetic control is achieved at low temperature, thus circumventing the thermodynamic default, many
                                 of the inorganic materials made by this process exhibit morphologies and electronic properties not observable in the corresponding
                                 products made by conventional high temperature processes. The electronic properties of some of these novel materials suggest
                                 strong advantages for high-efficiency photovoltaics, lightweight high power-density 3-D batteries, improved battery safety,
                                 uncooled IR detectors and other energy and information storage applications. Because no organics are used, the resulting products
                                 exhibit very high purity, making the process fully integrable with MOCVD and other conventional manufacturing methods. Because
                                 synthesis occurs from solution, adaptation to roll-to-roll and other high throughput methods may be possible. Transitioning
                                 of these developments to Army applications is now beginning. Related efforts now in progress are focused on revolutionary,

                                 and optoelectronic semiconductor materials, to obtain control over structure and enhancement of properties never before achievable.

                              Many Army applications, such as driver vision enhancement (DVE), rifle sights, seekers, physical security, target acquisition,
                                 and fire control, would benefit from affordable, passive uncooled infrared (IR) sensor options. The main considerations for
                                 uncooled IR sensors are cost, weight, and power. We have begun a three-year effort to develop a novel approach to the fabrication
                                 of uncooled IR focal-plane array (FPA) detectors using bio-inspired, low-temperature, multimetallic perovskite nanoparticle
                                 deposition, direct-write digitally-scripted laser phase conversion, and MEMS fabrication and optimization techniques. Success
                                 is contingent on fully characterizing the perovskite films and resolving basic materials issues during the first year of this

                                 the cementing polychaete, Phragmatopoma Californica. Our results Show that the chemosensory mechanisms and the internal signal
                                 transducers mediating the induction of larval attachment and metamorphosis in both Phragmatopoma and Haliotis larvae are highly
                                 related at the molecular level, thus providing evidence from 2 phyla that the molecular mechanisms regulating the initial

                              We present atomic force microscopy observations of mature nacre, specifically the polygonal aragonite tablets which comprise
                                 the mineral portion of nacre, in two types of molluscs, a bivalve (Atrina serrate) and a gastropod (Haliotis rufescens). By
                                 imaging in liquids it was possible to dissolve away the nacre layer by layer to reveal both the structure of a single, tablet
                                 and its relationship to vertically adjacent tablets. Atrina tablets (inner face) had a concave appearance; the central depression
                                 was surrounded by elongate rings mimicking the orientation and aspect ratio of the unit cell rectangle. Unit cell orientations
                                 were generally aligned vertically and laterally between tablets of Atrina, although occasional twinning was also observed.
                                 Etching (with HCI) initially removed a top crust in bleached Atrina tablets, revealing a flatter base without the elongate
                                 rings. Further etching lifted off individual tablets to reveal underlying nacreous layers, showing no morphological registry
                                 between vertically adjacent tablets. The nacreous structure of Haliotis differed from Atrina in three ways: (1) the tablets
                                 were flatter and showed no top crust or elongate rings; (2) the positions of the central depressions approximately repeated
                                 between nacreous layers, showing that the (presumed) nucleation sites line up along a given stack; and (3) the unit cell orientations
                                 were not preserved between laterally adjacent tablets but were between vertically adjacent tablets-an observation which could
                                 not be made by X-my crystallography

                              The principal long term objective of this project was to identify and characterize those environmental, biological, and surface
                                 parameters that control the initial and rate-limiting processes of larval settlement, attachment, metamorphosis, growth and
                                 recruitment of macrofouling organisms on surface immersed in the ocean. Macrofouling of surfaces immersed in the ocean is
                                 initiated by the delivery and attachment of larvae or propagules from the plankton. Work in our laboratory conducted with
                                 support from an earlier contract from ONR revealed that settlement, attachment and metamorphosis of larvae of the mollusc,
                                 Haliotis rufescens, are controlled by the interaction between two chemosensory pathways. Receptors of the morphogentic pathway
                                 recognize a surface-associated biochemical morphogen, produced by certain marine algae and bacteria, that is required to induce
                                 larval settlement, attachment and metamorphosis

Biological and Biomimetic Low-Temperature Routes to Materials for Energy Applications



Morse, Daniel E.
August 2016


New materials are needed to significantly improve the efficiencies of energy harnessing, transduction and storage, yet the synthesis of advanced composites and multi-metallic semiconductors with nanostructures optimized for these functions remains poorly understood and even less well controlled. To help address this need, we proposed three goals: (1) to further investigate the hierarchical structure of the biologically synthesized silica comprising the skeletal spicules of sponges that we discovered, to better resolve the role and mechanism of templating by the hierarchically assembled silicatein protein filament; (2) to extend our molecular and genetic analyses and engineering of silicatein, the self-assembling, structure-directing, silica-synthesizingmore » enzyme we discovered and characterized, to better understand and manipulate the catalysis and templating of semiconductor synthesis,; and (3) to further investigate, scale up and harness the biologically inspired, low-temperature, kinetically controlled catalytic synthesis method we developed (based on the mechanism we discovered in silicatein) to investigate the kinetic control of the structure-function relationships in magnetic materials, and develop new materials for energy applications. The bio-inspired catalytic synthesis method we have developed is low-cost, low temperature, and operates without the use of polluting chemicals. In addition to direct applications for improvement of batteries and fuel cells, the broader impact of this research includes a deeper fundamental understanding of the factors governing kinetically controlled synthesis and its control of the emergent nanostructure and performance of a wide range of nanomaterials for energy applications.« less

A method for the fabrication of nanostructured semiconducting, photoconductive, photovoltaic, optoelectronic and electrical battery thin films and materials at low temperature, with no molecular template and no organic contaminants. High-quality metal oxide semiconductor, photovoltaic and optoelectronic materials can be fabricated with nanometer-scale dimensions and high dopant densities through the use of low-temperature biologically inspired synthesis routes, without the use of any biological or biochemical templates.

Evolutionary selection of enzymatically synthesized semiconductors from biomimetic mineralization vesicles



Bawazer, Lukmaan A.
						; Izumi, Michi
						; Kolodin, Dmitriy
						; ... October 2012 - Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA


The way nature evolves and sculpts materials using proteins inspires new approaches to materials engineering but is still not completely understood. Here, we present a cell-free synthetic biological platform to advance studies of biologically synthesized solid-state materials. This platform is capable of simultaneously exerting many of the hierarchical levels of control found in natural biomineralization, including genetic, chemical, spatial, structural, and morphological control, while supporting the evolutionary selection of new mineralizing proteins and the corresponding genetically encoded materials that they produce. DNA-directed protein expression and enzymatic mineralization occur on polystyrene microbeads in water-in-oil emulsions, yielding synthetic surrogates of biomineralizing cellsmore » that are then screened by flow sorting, with light-scattering signals used to sort the resulting mineralized composites differentially. We demonstrate the utility of this platform by evolutionarily selecting newly identified silicateins, biomineralizing enzymes previously identified from the silica skeleton of a marine sponge, for enzyme variants capable of synthesizing silicon dioxide (silica) or titanium dioxide (titania) composites. Mineral composites of intermediate strength are preferentially selected to remain intact for identification during cell sorting, and then to collapse postsorting to expose the encoding genes for enzymatic DNA amplification. Some of the newly selected silicatein variants catalyze the formation of crystalline silicates, whereas the parent silicateins lack this ability. The demonstrated bioengineered route to previously undescribed materials introduces in vitro enzyme selection as a viable strategy for mimicking genetic evolution of materials as it occurs in nature.« less
