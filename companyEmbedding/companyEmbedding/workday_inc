Workday, Inc. is an on‑demand (cloud-based) financial management and human capital management software vendor. It was founded by David Duffield, founder and former CEO of ERP company PeopleSoft, and former PeopleSoft chief strategist Aneel Bhusri following Oracle's hostile takeover of PeopleSoft in 2005. It targets the customers of rivals Oracle or SAP. In October 2012, it launched a successful initial public offering that valued the company at $9.5 billion.[7]

Early history[edit]
Workday was founded in March 2005 and launched in November 2006.[8] Initially, it was funded by Duffield and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In December 2008, Workday moved its headquarters from Walnut Creek, California to Pleasanton, California, where PeopleSoft, founder Duffield's prior company, was located. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.[9][10]
On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

Workday has released 27 updates to its product line as of September 2016. It releases a major update every 6 months.[citation needed]

Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

Early history[edit]
Workday was founded in March 2005 and launched in November 2006.[8] Initially, it was funded by Duffield and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In December 2008, Workday moved its headquarters from Walnut Creek, California to Pleasanton, California, where PeopleSoft, founder Duffield's prior company, was located. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.[9][10]
On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

Early history[edit]
Workday was founded in March 2005 and launched in November 2006.[8] Initially, it was funded by Duffield and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In December 2008, Workday moved its headquarters from Walnut Creek, California to Pleasanton, California, where PeopleSoft, founder Duffield's prior company, was located. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.[9][10]
On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

4 Reasons to Like Workday, Inc.
Workday stock appears overpriced at first glance, but it may just be getting started.











                Palbir Nijjar
            

                (CashRulez)



            
            Jun 24, 2017 at 3:09PM
            
            





It's been less than five years since cloud-based human capital management and financial management provider Workday, Inc. (NYSE:WDAY) went public. In that time, the stock has more than doubled, handily outpacing rivals Oracle and SAP, which are up around 50% during the same period.

WDAY data by YCharts
Workday's returns since its IPO have been impressive, but peeling back the onion a bit, half that increase has occurred since the beginning of this year as Wall Street appears optimistic about improved offerings and increasing market share. With its recent run, it's understandable that investors would be hesitant to invest in a company that is still seeking profitability. In fact, many investors may be thinking about cashing in their chips. However, the company still appears to have room to run. Here are four reasons I like the company and its stock, even at today's prices.
Accelerating growth
As Workday matures, it's only natural that growth at the company slows, which did happen for a time at Workday. The chart below shows Workday's quarterly revenue growth from its IPO until July 2016. 

WDAY Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
However, since then, growth has picked up in every quarter, accelerating the most in the most recent quarter ending in April.

WDAY Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Even more impressive is that Workday's bread-and-butter source of revenue, subscription fees, were up 42.7% in the last quarter, an increase from 39% during the same period last year. Over the last year, Workday has increased momentum with Workday Financial Management, the company's core finance and accounting management application, along with other add-on solutions. It has also succeeded in obtaining larger enterprise customers as the company said it had its highest growth in its annualized contract value in three years.  
Success outside of core product 
One of the reasons for the uptick in revenue growth is the momentum in Workday Financial Management.  In Q2, Workday added 29 new core financial management customers, including Nasdaq and and Nuffield Health, the U.K.'s largest not-for-profit healthcare provider. Workday also announced deals with 21st Century Fox and CNA Financial Corporation.
In addition to success in its financial management suite, Workday Planning, which offers the ability to collaborate on financial and workforce plans, now boasts over 140 customers, which CEO Aneel Bhusri called one its best new product launches. Workday Learning, its learning management system, is up to 165 customers. The company is not resting on the laurels of its past successes either, as the company looks to gain momentum in its new analytics offerings. Bhusri made the following comment in the company's latest earnings call [transcript via Seeking Alpha] :

On the [heels] of the success of Workday Planning and Workday Learning we are seeing increased levels of activity around Workday Financial Performance Management, a new SKU [stock keeping unit] we introduced at the start of the fiscal year and high levels of interests in Workday Prism Analytics, our advanced analytics offering that will become available with Workday 29 in the fall. And stay tuned for some other exciting offerings that we will discuss in the upcoming months.

The HCM [human capital management] field is where Workday has had most of its success. Although not all its sales are related to HCM, with trailing-12-month revenue of $1.7 billion and a total addressable market estimated by IDC at $13 billion, Workday still has ways to go in capturing more share. However, analytics and financials are estimated to be $19 billion and $27 billion markets, respectively. If Workday can capture meaningful market share in these areas, its growth may prove to be in the early innings.





Capturing mid-size and large customers
As a pure SaaS [software as a service] provider, Workday is more attractive to smaller budgets that may put on-premise solutions out of reach. Therefore, it's a natural fit for the mid-size market where it has seen a lot of success.

With Nasdaq and 21st Century Fox, Workday has shown it can succeed with larger enterprises, too. However, the company had even bigger wins in the HCM space. This year, the company has added Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Target as customers. Qantas Airways also signed up, covering 45,000 employees in 26 countries. Human capital management is Workday's strength. Now that it has its foot in the door with heavy hitters, expect the company to make inroads in the much larger financial management market.
Valuation
Workday stock currently trades at over 12 times sales. Salesforce, which has a business model comparable to Workday, is trading at 7 times sales. Despite Salesforce being a more mature company, Workday still appears richly valued at first glance. However, I believe it may still have room to run.
Last summer, Oracle purchased cloud enterprise resource planning provider Netsuite for $9.3 billion, a valuation of 11 times NetSuite's previous 12 months revenue, which could provide insight into what Workday is worth. This acquisition provides a good yardstick for Workday as Netsuite exhibited 15 straight quarters of revenue growth over 30% prior to the acquisition -- a feat accomplished by Workday over a longer time frame.  With the overall market trading at higher levels than last summer, especially among tech companies, paying 12 times sales for a company with Workday's growth is not far off from what Oracle paid for NetSuite.
Additionally, Workday boasts a market capitalization of $21 billion. Salesforce was a $21 billion company in July 2011. At that time, similar to Workday, it also traded around 12 times sales with revenue just under $2 billion. Not too many analysts or investors would have called the company undervalued. Today, Salesforce sports a market capitalization just under $65 billion, triple its value from 2011. Whether Workday can execute as well as Salesforce remains to be seen, but between human capital management, financial management, and analytics, Workday's total addressable market is estimated to be over $65 billion. According to Gartner,  the customer relationship market in which Salesforce specializes is estimated to be $36.5 billion in 2017. Although there are no guarantees that Workday can become as successful as Salesforce, I see many similarities between the two companies. 
Between accelerating revenue growth, the addition of successful product lines, and signing up big customers, Workday has a lot going for it. This has been reflected in the stock price. However, the market may just be underestimating how large Workday may become.

We are thinking about implementing the recruiting function and utilizing the analytics for recruiting purposes (past employers, universities, outside organization affiliations...) but have not purchased that function as of yet. Right now we use it for tracking when I think it could be used for so much more.ProsWorkday is visually appealing. I enjoy working in Workday.Workday is intuitive and guides you through the process.The administrators are able to fix problems quickly.ConsWorkday can be slow at times and will just shut down when overused.The permissions are not easily fixed manually.The trainers are not knowledgeable about the product and are not very helpful.Likelihood to Recommend7.0Well suited in an environment that embraces intuitive technology. from Authenticated Review (3 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerManager in Human Resources | Retail | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday makes my day easier, every day,"10 of 10  |  4/13/2017Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is used across our organization. Employees use it for "self-service" such as entering their hours works, requesting vacation days, making benefit elections and viewing paystubs. Managers use it to view their teams, approve compensation and job changes, and hire and terminate employees. Human Resources uses it as our system of record for all employee data- personal information, job information, location, compensation, benefits. And we use it to run reports based on all of that data.ProsReporting- this is a huge aspect for me. I can customize reports and create my own "calculated fields" to quickly pull out any information from the system that I need. The reports can then be automated to run on a set schedule so they are there waiting for you when you need them.User friendly interface- our employees are using this system on a daily basis so it is important for it to be user friendly. I think Workday does a good job making their setup very intuitive and easy to useCommunity- Workday has a "community" website where other users post questions and answers. I have found it to be very helpful to get feedback from the Workday experts and other users.ConsThis is very specific, but I wish there was a way to search by a field and see which reports are using that field. For example, if I want to see how many direct reports each of our managers have. I know I have a field called "Number of Direct Reports" but I can't remember which reports I have used that field in, so I end up having to create a brand new report.I do wish some of the larger reports would run faster. I sometimes end up having to come back later to get the results.The formatting of email notifications could be better. They come in plain text emails which are hard to read.Likelihood to Recommend10.0I always recommend Workday to others, mainly because the reporting makes my life so much easier. I think any large company with a significant amount of HR data to track would benefit from Workday. The implementation process is a significant time commitment so it may not be worth it for smaller companies who have other ways of tracking information.from Authenticated Review Authenticated ReviewerConsultant in Professional Services | Information Technology and Services | 10,001+ employeesWorkday HCM Review: "The next generation of cloud-based HCM platform is here, now!"9 of 10  |  3/28/2017Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeMy organization implements Workday HCM for clients, ranging from mid-size to large enterprises (as Workday defined as "LDP" and "LE", respectively). It is almost always used across the client's entire organization. As an HCM platform, it is cloud based so there is no infrastructure required on the client side, and is widely considered user-friendly and intuitive. My main role is to design and build integrations for Workday to integrate with legacy systems that clients currently use or need to replace. In that aspect, Workday is fairly rigid in the sense that a lot of the integrations are pre-packaged for vendors. There are additional tools that allow more customization but Workday tries to focus on templates to accelerate implementation times.ProsUser-friendly, intuitive user interface - Most in the industry would agree it is one of the best user interfaces for HCM platforms.Integration Cloud - Pre-packaged, template-based, integrations are very efficient to implement with certain vendors, compared to traditional customized integrations that are built over and over for the same vendor.Integration Studio - A custom eclipsed-based tool that allows drag-and-drop components to build custom solutions for certain systems. Flexible, adaptable, and scalable.ConsPlatform Modules - Still a work in progress in areas outside of HCM. For example, the financial module was being pushed by Workday recently but not all modules are available compared to traditional platforms such as PeopleSoft.Integration Cloud - There is still much to be desired on the templates. Not all vendors have specific templates and there are some bugs associated with certain templates.Integration Studio - The tool is very time consuming and has a steep learning curve. It's not necessarily a Workday's problem as the tool has to compromise between simplicity to use and flexibility/adaptability.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Any customer that wants to focus on its people and have a cloud-based platform that can pretty much manage anything HR related should consider Workday, as long as it's a mid-sized company because it can be cost-prohibitive for smaller companies.  Companies that cannot adapt to changes should think twice before implementing Workday as well because it is really a different concept than what traditional HR people are used to.from Authenticated Review Jason Fisher, PHR/SHRM-CPDirector, Human Resources - US Retail / North American Talent Acquisition | Financial Services | 1001-5000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday Works!"9 of 10  |  3/16/2017Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use all the basic functions of Workday Human Capital Management and just recently added the payroll module. This replaced ADP. We are looking to also use the onboarding module and link to our SmartRecruiters ATS.ProsEmployee self-serve was hard culturally to get going but has reduced some of the tasks done by our payroll and admin groups.Not hard to train. Our users were able to grasp and use Workday fairly quickly.Time and attendance are much easier to track and maintain with Workday. Plus we are much more compliant.ConsUpdates to the system don't come as frequently as one would want.Although training is easy, the system is not intuitive, meaning you can't just turn it on and let folks learn on their own. There is a learning curve.Likelihood to Recommend9.0It is not a perfect system but certainly is a very good one. Implementation took sometime and we used a third party vendor (TPV) to assist us. Lots of work up front but it is worth it to make system work for you.from Jason Fisher, PHR/SHRM-CP's Full Review Mudassir MalikBusiness Technology Analyst | Consumer Services | 10,001+ employeesReview: "Workday HCM - When it's the best choice, when it's not."7 of 10  |  10/27/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe used Workday HCM in our previous organization for HR, benefits, absence and time management and performance management. One of the best core problems it addressed was that Workday HCM acted as a unified interface to access all these different functions. Besides, automated self-service is nothing but bliss for employees as well as an HR team as it decreased the turn around time for employee requests and freed up the HR staff to focus on more important stuff.ProsA lot of our HR staff needed to access the system on the move and since it is on the cloud, we can access it from anywhere. It increased the mobility of staff.Straight forward no-nonsense system that is intuitive enough for your non-tech savvy employees to grasp.Business Intelligence and reporting is pretty good. Not only does it offer a lot of detailed analysis but it also allows you to configure dashboards which are great for executive and managers to quickly check the status of subject areas.ConsWhile the system is quite easy to use as an end user of most modules, even the most basic configuration and change would need expert help as there is very little documentation available to help you. The dependency on the implementation consultant is too much.New updates in system are not always thoroughly tested and it has at times broken our system. Although the fix provided was fast, it is advised to not directly jump when they provide the updates.If recruiting and onboarding is crucial to your organisation, it's better to look at an Oracle HCM implementation as there are a lot of integration issues with Workday Recruiting.Likelihood to Recommend7.0If you are relatively large organisation with a lot of departments, employees, job families and a lot more things under one company, Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) could be a good choice for you. Not to mention, if you are operating out of multiple countries like we used to, some of the Workday features can be life saving. However, if you are a smaller company or/and do not need much self service for employees and managers, it might not be the best suited solution for you. from Mudassir Malik's Full Review Sarah TrumanUS Payroll Manager | Management Consulting | 10,001+ employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday - a winning solution for your HCM needs!"10 of 10  |  8/3/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday HCM is being utilized by virtually everyone in the firm. It has been implemented for dashboards, tracking, reporting, and increased business use function. However, all employees will be on-boarded through Workday. Their reviews will occur within Workday. Job changes as well as salary changes will occur within Workday. One time payments will be entered and approved in Workday. Benefit selections will be made by employees in Workday. Workflows (business processes) have been built to route to the appropriate team for approvals for each specific task. Several integrations are coming out of Workday, as this has become our record of source for the company. It integrates seamlessly with ADP Vantage, and I have also used it with ADP Enterprise version 5 (Ev5). The company has been able to gather additional information to make better informed business decisions, to thereby steer the company into the future.ProsThe reporting analytics are truly fantastic! I have been able to gather any information I can dream up from its reporting capabilities. I currently have several reports running for new hires, terminations, LOAs, retro pay changes, a report that pulls specific documents in upload categories (terrific!), all employee payroll info for auditing payroll data, and so on. The only thing to remember is to pull reports based on effective dates and approval dates, which are considered two different options in Workday. If not, transactions can be missed.Working with my auditors is easier than ever! I just print off the new hire or termination business process flow. This documents each step of the process with a date, time stamp, as well as comments of the approver. I have had no push back on the information provided from Workday in an audit.The back button! In most data systems, there is a home key, or search button that has to be hit after clicking within an employee's file. In Workday, the back button can be hit in any screen to take you to the previous screen. It is wonderful!Workday allows the capability to drill down to the most minute detail. Simply by clicking on the item, with security permission permitting, it allows drilling down to each item within the system. This allows for truly learning the system, and learning the values of the selections being processed.ConsWorkday HCM does not have the functionality to hold state tax elections unless the payroll module is purchased. A workaround at my last company was to create a document category, and then have the employee upload the tax documents. A report was ran at payroll submission to pull these documents. The down side was that they then had to be manually processed into payroll. At my current company, the tax elections, both state and federal, are made in ADP - a business process is programmed within on-boarding that takes the employees outside of Workday to make these elections and then brings them back in to finish the on-boarding process. I'm sure Workday does this as a way to up-sell their product. However, it has resulted into a drawback and hindrance instead.At my last company, there were 13 US pay groups, with several hundred locations, cost centers, and so on. It would be great if Workday had the ability to limit the selection of cost centers and locations based on pay group. For example, for one company/pay group, there are only a certain number of valid locations and cost centers. However, Workday allowed any cost center or location to be chosen for the employee. This caused integration failures into ADP US and ADP Canada when invalid locations and cost centers were chosen.As Workday is the record of source, all allowances should be entered and approved in this system. In theory, it should flow to payroll from here, with the charge number, and then on to the GL. In my current company, many types of allowances are used with many different charge numbers. The charge numbers may not match the home department for the employee as the employees work on many different projects, and the allowances are subject to change based on the project. The charge numbers on the allowances could conceivably change each month for some employees. For one-time payments, a work around with work tags were able to be utilized in a customization field with the charge numbers so that the integrations from Workday would bring over both the one-time payment with the charge number. Allowances do not have that capability. This was a big problem for my current company, and one we are still working thru. It appears that a report will be downloaded from Workday from our data management team, and then input into FileMaker with the charge numbers from there. Then, an output will be sent to payroll. It is taking quite a bit of maneuvering and extra work. No one is very happy with our work around or the fact charge numbers could not be entered.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Workday is well suited for reporting, auditing, integrations, and reviewing worker history. It is less appropriate for tracking state taxes without the payroll module. It is also less appropriate if a company pays several allowances with different project costing.from Sarah Truman's Full Review (2 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerConsultant in Information Technology | Human Resources | 10,001+ employeesReview: "Workday Human Capital Management from the Implementer's Side."9 of 10  |  7/22/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday Human Capital Management is being implemented by my organization, so we don't use it, just implement it. Since it is cloud-based, it makes it easier for our customers to stay up to date with the latest versions without being negatively impacted by the updates. Workday's friendly UI also helps customers navigate and configure their system more easily.ProsCloud-based updates. Easier for companies to stay up to date with latest technologies.Friendly and user intuitive UI.No local servers needed by the companies. Everything is hosted by Workday.ConsIt is not 100% fleshed out for companies with a large user-base (but it is getting there).On the expensive side.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Well-suited when a company is doing well and wants to modernize its processes. It is on the expensive side and time consuming to deploy so some companies might opt to stay with their old systems due to the employee training that will be required when switching to Workday.from Authenticated Review Isaac Dixon, PhD., SPHRAssociate Vice President and Director Human Resources | Higher Education | 501-1000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday Year One!"7 of 10  |  7/20/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe implemented Workday just over a year ago. We went from a largely paper based system and a old legacy system that was not really designed to support HR processes. Our implementation lasted approximately 8 months as the result of a great team from LC and our implementation partners at Meteorix. Workday is used to manage human capital transactions related to employee onboarding, benefit enrollment, time and attendance tracking and payroll. Moving from paper has helped us clean up and refine our reporting as well as our work processes too! Employing Workday is as much about organizational change as it is anything else. Workday is best done in organizations where executive support and sponsorship are high. This also means that HR teams must develop better skills around project planning and management, data analysis as well as process improvement. This are not skills native to many HR professionals but there are lots of smart people with these skills who will be great assets to your HR team as they move to Workday. It is also most important that your organization understand that Workday is where the world outside of your institution has already gone. At home, your employees are used to information being "pushed" to their mobile devices or desktops. They do not expect to have to call Amazon, file a request for information and wait to hear back. When they come to work and human capital management and other solutions work at glacial speed they find it frustrating. The old "pull" model for getting information on longer fits the speed of organizational life. Workday increased our capacity to get things that really matter done by automating "transactional activity" so that my staff can spend time with faculty, staff and student employees helping them do things that are of greater value to them and the college. This is what Workday is about, making HR more strategically relevant both today and tomorrow.ProsOnboarding: Putting everything related to an employee coming on board into one place makes it much easier for people to understand what is expected of them and for us to see what they have done and need to do.Benefits management: We did our first online enrollment a year ago and for the most part it went exceptionally well. Most of our employees had complained for sometime about the amount of paper they had to fill out for benefits enrollment each year and the previous system required navigating 10 screens to make a benefit change for one employee.Time Reporting and Attendance Tracking: This makes managing employee time and attendance much more accurate and likely to be reviewed by submitting managers. It also eliminated several hundred paper timesheets each month!ConsThe training modules have greatly improved these were the weakest items when we went live a year agoGreater assistance on the need for culture change in organizations. Many organizations think they are buying an appliance and they're not prepared for the amount of organizational change that will ensue.Getting Workday financials might have made the implementation of the payroll piece a bit easier. We are still writing interfaces with our GL because that is on the old system.Likelihood to Recommend7.0Is your team tech savvy enough to manage their end of the project? Do you have a project manager in your organization to keep things on time/track?How well documented are your processes? If they are like most HR teams this is where you need to do quite a bit of work prior to getting into to Workday.As I stated earlier change leading organizations will do well with the product. Change resistant environments will struggle as this product forces you to move more quickly than you are comfortable with.Key question: When do we want to go live and what resources are we willing to put into the project?from Isaac Dixon, PhD., SPHR's Full Review (5 More Sections)Raghavendran ParthasarathyPrincipal Consultant & Delivery Head ,Workday Practice | Computer Software | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday Vs On premises /Outdated HCM ERP"9 of 10  |  7/18/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday provides advanced capabilities for the HCM community by unmatched modern facilities like complete digitalization of HR documents, latest analytics, embedded analytics, exceptional system audit functionality, and complete system in the cloud with no restrictions on data storage and integrating the cloud system with other HR systems as well.It addresses the following problems1.

It is used for the following areas; benefits, payroll, organization hierarchy, employee performance (review/goals), and employee talent (work history/education/certification). From an end user stand point it is a platform that bridges the company to the employee. It aids in direct communication and visibility of critical information for both the organization/employee that drives openness, development, and full engagement through the use of an advanced user oriented program interface. Although I do not currently use or require additional functionality within Workday it is also a tool that can perform all analytical calculations and charting required across multiple business roles (executive/finance/human resources).ProsUser friendly interface - Simple and clean user interface. Includes a home screen with high level functionality to each available area (benefits, payroll, organization hierarchy, employee performance (review/goals), and employee talent (work history/education/certification). It is easy to navigate and find any/all information.Notification/workflow - When the organization or employee is required to perform a task Workday has the required workflows for each action/individual and directly communicates with your company's email system to provide an automated notification. These then direct you to their prompts/tutorials (see below).Included user prompt/tutorials - When an employee is required to enter information within the program (i.e. change of address/goals/etc..) an installed sub prompt directs the individual through all of the required steps. This is very similar and as user friendly as online tax programs (i.e. TurboTax).ConsFull buy in/support - The program by itself is great. However, it is only great if there is support and acceptance from both the organization and employee where it is used. I feel fortunate that I have experienced both of these within my current company, but the transition from our previous system to Workday lacked the proper training documents for immediate acceptance. I know the software is customized for each end use, but I believe better end use documentation and/or instructions between the software provider and the organization could smooth this process.Workday/End User Communication - More visibility/communication for certain functionality between workday and the end users (employee). For example, a highlight of best practices or hidden functionality. My best example would be the web portal access outside of your organizations network. It is a great feature to access information anywhere, but goes unnoticed by many users because they do not know it exists. This can be provided from Workday to the Employee or form Workday to Organization to Employee.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Workday is well suited for medium/large organizations that have a decent amount of employees. A smaller organization could make great use of the functionally of the software, but I believe the justification of use could be less advantageous.from Matt Gill's Full Review Melissa CypherSr. Consultant - Payroll Tax & HRIS | Education Management | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM: "Workday Review - Great for HR, good for mid-sized/small organizations!"7 of 10  |  7/14/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeIt is being used across the organization, to streamline business efforts with HR, Benefits, Payroll, and integrations with our student systems and other vendors, but provides us with a more flexible and modern system to manage our information among those systems.ProsThe flexibility of being a cloud-based system that users can log on from anywhere (including administrators) to use with a simple sign-in screen - no special downloads or certificates needed to access your data.The ability to customize (within the structure of the system) what users see and access, as well as the self-service capabilities for employees.Most actions and activities in Workday can be tracked as a "to-do", so you can follow up on something at a later time without forgetting about it.Finding employee data is fairly easy, the search tool is a great feature of Workday.ConsThe Payroll module is lacking some major reports "out of the box". For example, coming to Workday from a payroll service provider, we realized Workday doesn't have a clean Payroll Register or Payroll Summary report that can be used for audits or top-level reconciliation. We had to build custom reports to manage that, but most reports only output to Excel, so Workday lacks some clean PDF versions that satisfy Auditors needs when looking to compare top-level payroll information.The Payroll module does not come with in-house training. The realization is that the consultants your organization uses, are also going to be your trainers, leaves many facing challenges of information not being passed to the end-users properly. Workday needs to provide more web-based training, at no extra cost, to users of the system. Payroll is an important module within Workday, and users need to understand the "how's" and "why's" of the system - because it is quite different from other in-house and SaaS payroll systems.The Payroll Module is still very young, so there are many developments needed to make it more effective for large organizations. From reports, to tax configurations, to exports and imports of data from 3rd parties, Workday needs to put more focus on listening to its users and making things available more quickly than years down the road. We have had issues with tax calcs and had to identify necessary changes Workday needed to make, which are things other payroll systems have already tackled. In some ways, it can feel like you are redesigning the wheel as you move forward with Workday Payroll.Likelihood to Recommend7.0Workday seems to be more suited to the Employee management and high-level data aspects of an organization. The financial structure of Worktags to mirror an accounting GL, create confusion among users new to Workday. The HR Information tracking and employee data capture and data management seem to be the most developed within Workday.Key Questions to ask as an organization: What is broken in your current organization that you want to fix? What modules would you benefit most from? Are you currently in-house or outsourced for payroll? If you are considering Workday as a full solution to HR, Finance, and Payroll needs, you may require additional heads to support the system depending on how large or detailed your organization is. This is not a system that will reduce your admin headcount if you currently outsource HR/Payroll needs to service providers such as ADP, Ceridian, etc.from Melissa Cypher's Full Review (2 More Sections)Tom GlasscockPrincipal | Human Resources | 1001-5000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday works for me!"10 of 10  |  7/14/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI helped a client company select and implement Workday for all of its 5,000 employees in 40 countries. Until that point, my client did not have a global, integrated HR system of record in place.ProsHighly configurable; makes it easy to conform to business requirementsGreat end user experience; intuitive interface is easy to navigateConsistent, transparent and inclusive cycle of innovation and improvementConsNo LMSSince it is easy to configure, a high level of discipline is required to keep workflow streamlined and simple. This is not as easy as it sounds.Likelihood to Recommend10.0System as a whole needs to mature further, particularly around recruiting.from Tom Glasscock's Full Review (12 More Sections)Linda BuckleyAssociate Director, Financial Applications | Higher Education | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM: "Workday offers unmatched, secure and integrated HR and Financials Management Capabilities for Higher Ed"10 of 10  |  7/14/2016Invited By: TrustRadiusUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is used across Georgetown University for Human Capital Management, Payroll, Benefits, Time Tracking, Academic Appointments. It provides an auditable workflow, electronic onboarding, and paperless benefits/payroll election. It also provides secure document and data storage. Workday replaced a highly customized main frame product (Genesys) that required alot of outside-system paper approvals and processing which result in delays, lost documentation and a specialized IT staff for maintenance.ProsThe Single User Version philosophy, while a challenge for change management due to the frequent upgrade cycle, allows for our unique higher education requirements to be incorporated rapidly. Because of this, Product support is responsive and timely.Georgetown is a design partner and this close relationship allows us to provide feedback for constant product improvement. This design partner philosophy and willingness to take feedback and adapt has been a huge selling point for user acceptance at Georgetown.Workday provides a very secure storage platform that experiences very infrequent outages. When outages occur they are typically resolved in under an hour.Even for non-design partners, Workday provides options to join User Groups to preview planned functionality. Also Workday encourages users to create Brainstorms for new ideas that the community votes upon. The ability to provide feedback prior to releases is also key to change management and user acceptance. Workday has a good track record in terms of adopting customer brainstorms.Workday maintains and facilitates a Community of Users to ensure self-sufficiency, sharing lessons learned and knowledge sharing.ConsAny ideas for improvement are considered by Workday and the company provides multiple avenues for feedback (see above). Any issues we have experienced in the past have been addressed or are in the process of being addressed.One source of frustration is the lack of documentation; however, with the rapid rate of improvement that Workday has been able to sustain, documentation is a reasonable trade-off for their responsiveness.Not an area for improvement, but a factor for consideration is that use of Workday does require some technical IT experience. A big selling point is that organizations don't need to keep teams of dbas and technical experts on hand to maintain the system, as with a Main-frame. But Workday does require some technical IT support. This is particularly true for integrations and reporting.Likelihood to Recommend10.0As with anything, the choice of product is dependent upon the needs of the organization. However if an organization wants an easy-to-use, intuitive, configurable system that improves constantly and is focused more on the business user than the technologist, Workday is ideal. If an organization is change-averse and wants a more traditional platform that is customizable, and stable for long periods of time with lots of documentation, this may not be the best fit. The difference between Workday and a more traditional ERP can be thought of as the difference between an iphone and a central switchboard.from Linda Buckley's Full Review (33 More Sections)Dale TolleySr. HR Generalist | Computer Software | 501-1000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday Reduces Cost, Reduces Risk and Increases Productivity at LANDesk Software, Inc."10 of 10  |  7/14/2016Invited By: TrustRadiusUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is our new HRIS that has replaced SAP company-wide. We are using Workday as our system of record and strategic platform for performance management, hiring and onboarding, expense management and human capital management. With Workday, we streamlined our open enrollment process from last year, we've reduced the time it takes for HR business partners to support their customers, and we've reduced data entry errors significantly. Automating employee self service tasks has also freed up our HR team to address more strategic issues and perform fewer transactional tasks.ProsIntuitive system: employees who are even minimally tech savvy can find more than one way to complete the task they are trying to do by themselves.Customizable and flexible business processes: Workday has the ability to adapt to a changing workforce and changing processes and policies very easily.Cloud based: Employees can access Workday from any computer and complete processes we need them to in a timely manner, without having to be logged into our company network.ConsUser Experience/Layout: Many screens in Workday have several scroll bars that can make navigating Workday difficult.Creating and merging custom security groups is not an easy task from the client side of Workday. Having a diagnostic walkthrough solution for creating custom security would be helpful.While onboarding is beginning to function in Workday, there is not yet a seamless integration to bridge services from an Applicant Tracking System into Workday.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Workday is well suited for a company seeking to manage a large number of employees more efficiently. Ideally, an HR team will be large enough proportionately to the employee base, as Workday can be leveraged to manage more employees, but having a larger staff to support a larger group of employees is still essential.from Dale Tolley's Full Review Susan DaviesPayroll Manager | Computer Software | 1001-5000 employeesUser Review: "Workday HCM - The right choice"10 of 10  |  6/17/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe are using Workday HCM across our organization for Onboarding, Benefits, Payroll, Absence Management and Time Tracking. We will soon be rolling out the manager self service functionality.ProsAssociate Self Service allows for the employee to manage their personal information and gives them the ability to set up and assign by pay type their direct deposit, Federal and State withholding. They also have varying views of their payslips - very detailed to just the basics.Accountability and visibility for absence management. Managers can view time off for their entire team, balances for their team.Our first experience was Open Enrollment last year. Users found Workday to be very intuitive and user friendly.ConsUnderstanding how the business processes drive the different components. Some components are very detailed. It really takes a designated person to be the subject matter expert of the "back of house" maintenance and trouble shooting.Out of the box we didn't know what we didn't know. It's taken us about 4 months to iron out some of the idiosyncrasies and connect the dots.Likelihood to Recommend10.0We absolutely love the ease of navigation and features of the modules we've initiated with Workday. I previously have used PeopleSoft, UltiPro and ADP systems and I consider Workday to be the Cadillac of these systems. We've only been on Workday 6 months and we continue to validate we made the right system choice for HCM, Benefits and Payroll.from Susan Davies's Full Review (6 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerDirector in Information Technology | E-Learning | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday -  A Platform to Consolidate your HR Applications"9 of 10  |  3/16/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is our global HRMS solution and it is used by all departments across the organization to manage employee information and to integrate this information into other HR and business systems. In times past we would use best of breed products but never really get to the point where leveraging the extra feature set of a best of breed product. With this portfolio of applications our employees would have a different application for services like Performance and Compensation. We have standardized on Workday for HRMS, Performance and Compensation management and will be implementing Workday Onboarding. This provides our employees with a single user interface for these functions and we expect to Workday to continually enhance these products in the semi-annual update cycle. ProsUser Interface - Workday is ERP software but presents information that aligns with the experience you get on good consumer sites. Workday started with a superior UI to other ERP software and was recently revamped to leverage HTML 5.Innovation Cycle - Enhancements are introduced twice a year and extends the product offering.Single Tenant - All customers are on the same version of the software. This is what has enabled Workday to drive the innovation cycle. From a customer perspective it means that documentation on the Workday Community site is current and applicable to the version of the software that you are running. This also extends opportunities to share information between customers.ConsWorkday Community - The community site should be a great place for information and to get questions answered. I feel that that the documentation on the site is missing specific examples and that Workday does not adequately manage the site. On the community sites for other business systems I see that the Help & Support team respond to unanswered questions. I don't see the same management of the site by Workday.User Interface - It may seem odd that I have User Interface as one of the things done well and as one of the things that need improvement. Because of the modern look and feel of Workday we went live with little user training and found that some processes like certain aspects of the performance review that were hard to understand. Also we recently modified one of our Business Processes to include the distribution of a report. Updating this configuration was not well documented on the community site and tricky to find out how to manage it in the User Interface.Reports and Data Sources - It's easy to build simple reports but the Workday Data Sources and available objects can be hard to understand.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Workday is very well suited for any company with 500+ employees especially for a company interested in implementing the HRMS as a SaaS. The HCM subscription includes Global HRMS, Payroll, Beneffits Administration, Onboarding, Performance and Compensation Management. If you use Workday to administrate these services you will get more value for your subscription. from Authenticated Review (3 More Sections)Carlino CecilioSr. Mgr, HR Operations and Systems | Computer & Network Security | 1001-5000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday can be used for any size company"10 of 10  |  2/19/2016Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI have used Workday for HCM, Payroll, Expense, Time tracking and performance. We have used it to deliver employee and manager capabilities that are easy to use and provide actionable data access. I have used it in all cases in hypergrowth companies. This means we are looking for efficiency gains and looking for a scalable solution that is flexible to meet our changing business needsProsThe user experience is superior to all others. It is built like all the consumer tools out there, so employees are familiar with the icons and navigationFinally a solution that really has reporting that is already built in. There is no need to buy a data warehouse or anythingConfiguring really is simple. you dont need to hire technical people to learn how to configure business processesConsThey can improve their performance solutions. performance reviews are done in a very traditional fashion and dont offer some of the new functionalityThe goals module is limited and needs to have more flexibility to be able to align goals and cascade them down the organizationLikelihood to Recommend10.0It is well suited for all types of companies especially complex companies. It is suited for companies that have a lot of changes in the way they do business, companies that change in headcount or acquire companies, and companies that change business rules.

We have implemented Core HCM, Performance Review and we are in the middle of implementing our new merit process in Workday. We have connectors from Workday to Oracle HR, to Active Directory, to benefit vendors, to Stock Administrators, etc.ProsOne of my favorite features of Workday is the actionable items and the fact that you can run a report and after auditing the data you can correct it from within the report.Workday is a complex system that allows great flexibility. It comes with predefined business processes that can be fully customized.Workday self service features for managers and employees are great and particularly those features that are mobile enabled.Dashboards and reporting are spectacular.ConsDocumentation. This is the first system I have ever worked that has such a lack of documentation.Creating advance reports and specifically creating calculated fields is very cumbersome.Payroll in general is still a very immature product. Most mature payroll systems handle taxation much better than Workday.Likelihood to Recommend6.0Workday is very well suited for small to medium size companies that are looking to be independent from IT.Ask specific questions about delivered reports, delivered connectors, out of the box business processes, etc. Make sure you understand how technical support works and also find out about how easy/difficult it would be to implement new modules in the future and ask how other companies usually deal with this issue.from Enrique Piovani's Full Review (7 More Sections)Jeff GreeningEngagement Manager, Workday Implementations | Information Technology and Services | 51-200 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Runs like well-oiled machine."10 of 10  |  10/22/2015Invited By: TrustRadiusUse Cases and Deployment ScopeN/AProsThe application runs fast and the design make the application intuitive; very similar to your favorite consumer website. If you can use Google, Amazon, or Zappos; you can use Workday. The End User Experience is the best that I have seen in any HRMS or Financials software. There are several visual dashboards that have graphs/charts that you can even take action on by drilling into the data. The user interface is very simple, even for those not technical savvy. The ability to make a change (Related Action) of almost any data object on one screen is very impressive.Mobile - The mobile experience for iPad and iPhone is amazing. Development is done with the mantra, "mobile first" to give end users the best experience.Integrations - Workday has made it possible to leverage out-of-the-box integrations for many third party vendors using Cloud Connect technology. This makes it more of an exercise of mapping the data and making configurations as opposed to full blown development efforts. Workday also supports Big Data which is very attractive to companies.Audit Trail Functionality: A very intuitive audit trail feature that does not require setup. Every single transaction is tracked.The Community: The Workday Community listens to its customers - whether it is a customer asking for advice or a "how-to" question or it is submitting a new idea to be added in one of the two major feature releases (updates) a year. Workday also allows customers to post solutions (integration builds, how-to guides, reports, creative solutions) to the Solution Catalog that other customers can leverage. Through the Community Q&A Forums, customers can interact with other end users and even partner consultants to help with an issue.Two updates a year with minimal downtime. The updates take place during a weekend and with the last update, there was only about 4 hours and 7 minutes of downtime. Workday is continuously adding new features that can be turned on by the customer discretion and over the last few updates, Workday has added over 250 new features based on customer input alone from the Community Brainstorms.And finally, a single version across all customers is key in a real SaaS solution. Long gone are the days of asking another company what version they are on.ConsOne of the opportunities that I see as an Implementation Partner is to offer additional training for reporting. While the reporting tool, with proper knowledge transfer and training, can be easy to use - most customers do not have the time to focus on this during the original implementation. I would recommend that your implementation partner spend time with the Subject Matter Expert showing the basics of Reporting and assisting on writing a few key and critical reports to give adequate knowledge transfer. Take advantage of the BIRT Reporting tool. In addition, enable the various Dashboards for your management team and executives. .With the SaaS implementation, since everything is "documented" in the tenant; customers sometimes cannot adjust to less documentation. The documentation is typically no where close to traditional ERP Implementations that includes things like As-Is and To-Be process flows and the "implementation binder."Workday has moved to 2 updates a year, with that being said, customers have to update their internal training documents to adopt changes every 6 months that can be burdensome for some customers. Workday does provide customers an updated tenant 5 weeks in advance of the Update weekend in order to have adequate time to test and make any necessary changes to documentation.Security: Workday Security setup and configuration can be very complex. I would recommend that Security Administrators attend Workday Training during the initial deployment.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Please note that this review was written by an Implementation Partner of Workday. The views and opinions expressed here are my own only and in no way represent the views, positions or opinions - expressed or implied - of my employer (present and past). from Jeff Greening's Full Review (44 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerProfessional in Human Resources | Financial Services | 1001-5000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday. Will it be like a fine wine and get better over time?"4 of 10  |  5/6/2015Invited By: TrustRadiusUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is utilized by the company as a whole. Human Resources utilizes it for employee information such as basic data, compensation, benefits, etc and reporting. Finance utilizes it for expenses request, for determining cost allocations and such. Employees are using it to request days off and for self service transactions such as name and address changes.ProsEmployees basic data is easily accessed.Easy for employees to request time off and update their personal information.Benefits open enrollment has been made easier.ConsReporting is not user friendly.The expense system is confusing to most users. If you accidently hit one wrong button, you lose all your data and are required to redo it all. If the AP team denies a request you also have to reenter everything if you're correcting and trying to resubmit.Some of the tabs are confusing too. You have Job History, Worker History, etc. Some of the info overlaps, other info doesn't and then you can never remember what you clicked on if you ever need to get back to it. I'm fairly technically savvy, so it definitely isn't "operator error."Likelihood to Recommend4.0I think it's user friendly for keeping track of basic employee data. I also like the ease of use during our open enrollment period for benefits. It's easy to use and understand. I think they need to work on updating their expense side so that it isn't so complicated for users to utilize. If you are a potential client, be sure to have them delve deep into how it all works, it is possible that ours isn't customized appropriatly for our use. For a potential client, I'd want them to go step-by-step on the various user tabs so that you have a better understanding how they can and should be utilized. Again, maybe our customization is off.from Authenticated Review (2 More Sections)Robert GoodmanDirector, Business Intelligence & Analytics | 5001-10,000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday - a nice cloud-based alternative to Genesys"8 of 10  |  3/3/2015Invited By: TrustRadiusProsWorkday has a robust reporting engine and handles workflow very well. Business processes can be established to handle virtually any scenario. Their Worktag model offers an effective means of hierarchical reporting.ConsWorkday has a Big Data initiative. They extend the capability to mash data from various sources into the Workday platform. While it is possible to extract data from the Workday platform, their is a governor on the API in terms of volume that can be exported. We find this limiting and creates complex processing for our business intelligence team. We have been able to use custom reports to extract large volumes of data, but this still remains slower than a traditional fat-client ERP database connection.We have found that Workday did not thoroughly test deprecated functionality during new releases. This has caused some functionality to 'break' unexpectedly when upgrading tenants. That being said, they have been quick to collaboratively work with us to resolve the issue(s). I suspect this process will ever improve as the company continues to grow.Likelihood to Recommend8.0N/Afrom Robert Goodman's Full Review (9 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerAnalyst in Information Technology | Information Technology and Services | 10,001+ employeesWorkday HCM Review: "onboarding with workday"9 of 10  |  3/3/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWorkday is being implemented to integrate platforms for performance management, compensation management, and general people management. Today we use multiple systems for position management and are retiring old systems for each of these processes in order to consolidate and expedite.ProsWorkday is enabling consistent, streamlined reporting across HR and the businessWorkday will allow managers access to worker history that we have never been able to package and put online before.ConsWe are working to integrate with SAP payroll and there are challenges in mapping things like action/reasons and infotypes. This is in the details and it's where we are spending most of our time.The product / methodology is light on documentation and this is difficult when it comes to communicating the changes to the business.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Workday is great for mid-size companies and it's important for a user to document priorities prior to starting the project, but also to be flexible during the implementation. I think our major difficulties are encountered when we are unable to agree to a global process, which is absolutely critical in a global implementation. from Authenticated Review (2 More Sections)Amanda EastonAssociate Director, Human Resources | Financial Services | 1001-5000 employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday helps us work smarter."10 of 10  |  1/23/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use Workday across the whole organization, for 3100+ employees in 12 countries, for employee data management, time and absence management, expenses, talent management, data analysis and more. Workday is a unified global solution that provides increased transparency and consistency in HR processes ,and enables our HR team to spend more time focused on higher value-add contributions to the organization. Our managers and leaders can make better business decisions with more information at their fingertips.ProsThe user experience is very intuitive and is in line with what people want to see and do with an online application these days. We don't have to spend much time on training employees and managers because they can generally figure out how to do what they need to do on their own. The ease of use and look & feel are some of the reasons we chose Workday to begin with, and it's getting better with age.Security. It's flexible so you can allow access to what you want and block what you don't. And it's solid. And you don't have to remember who has access to what when building and delivering reports and chance exposing confidential or sensitive information. If they don't have permission to see it, they don't see it.Reporting capabilities are amazing. We're several years in and still feel like we're just scratching the surface. Our executives love the dashboard views and have set them as the standard for other internal dashboard-like reporting.ConsTime Tracking in countries with complex work-week and shift schedules is a challenge. I expect we'll continue to see improvements with Workday planned global expansion.I would love for Workday to provide in-depth training at no cost for system administrators. We are able to manage the system and our needs independently. Depending on the project, it may take us longer and we may not really be optimizing the process or system if we're missing knowledge and experience that would help us do so.Likelihood to Recommend10.0Workday is doing a great job of meeting the needs of all different types and sizes of organizations. The most important questions to ask during the selection process are the areas where your organization does something in a very specific way and change is not an option. The answer (with many vendors) will be "yes, we can do that" but will you really be happy with what it looks like? Or do limitations exist that don't in your current process? Whenever we find ourselves bending and breaking things to make our process fit, we re-evaluate what we're trying to do and how we're trying to do it, and usually we're able to approach it differently for the same or better result. from Amanda Easton's Full Review (8 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerProfessional in Human Resources | Non-Profit Organization Management | 10,001+ employeesWorkday HCM Review: "Workday - HRIS product of now and the future!"9 of 10  |  1/23/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe are using Workday as a self-service tool organization-wide. Our HR department uses Workday as the system of record and the information integrates to our payroll department. We also use Workday for our performance review process and benefits enrollment. It addresses a previous business problem of inconsistency of stored data (we are an international organization and needed a system that would work for all locations). Workday also helps us with personnel data integrity by its report writing capabilities.ProsWorkday has excellent report writing capability. It provides hundreds of standard reports and also enables you to create custom reports. These reports can be shared with staff or kept restricted to certain departments.Workday offers a comprehensive way of managing position information through the use of position management, job profiles, job families, and job family groups. This is particularly helpful for market analysis and EEO and Affirmative Action reporting.High level security - highly customizable.Great opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions; there is a Workday Community for all users and this input is taken into account for future version updates.ConsWorkday users will need training - not all areas of the system are intuitive (report writing, for example).Version updates can be too frequent; although they reduced updates from four times per year to two, it can be challenging to our staff to reacquaint themselves with a newer version, particularly if it includes a redesign.Unless really customized, there are sometimes too many clicks to get through a process.Likelihood to Recommend9.0One question to ask is: What is the number of employees? Workday is ideal for larger organizations and is capable of accommodating many departments, unions, special job groups, etc. within one company profile. What regions will it be used in? Since it's a robust product, connectivity and bandwidth may be an issue for more remote areas of the world (something to keep in mind for international organizations). It is well suited for employee self-service and provides a comprehensive company directory.from Authenticated Review (2 More Sections)Workday HCM Rating SummaryOverall Rating (128)7.7Likelihood to Recommend (34)9.0Likelihood to Renew (15)9.4Usability (10)7.6Availability (8)7.0Performance (7)7.5Support (8)8.1In-Person Training (6)9.1Online Training (7)7.0Implementation (11)7.9Product scalability (1)8.0Feature Rating SummaryHuman Resource Management (26)8.6Employee demographic data (26)8.8Employment history (24)8.4Job profiles and administration (24)8.5Workflow for transfers, promotions, pay raises, etc. (25)8.5Organizational charting (25)8.9Organization and location management (25)8.7Compliance data (COBRA, OSHA, etc.) (21)8.5Payroll Management (20)8.9Pay calculation (18)9.1Support for external payroll vendors (17)8.0Benefit plan administration (16)8.8Direct deposit files (17)9.1Salary revision and increment management (18)8.9Reimbursement management (12)9.3Leave and Attendance Management (20)9.1Approval workflow (20)9.4Balance details (20)9.2Annual carry-forward and encashment (18)8.6Employee Self Service (25)8.7View and generate pay and benefit information (22)8.9Update personal information (25)9.2View company policy documentation (17)8.3Employee recognition (14)8.5View job history (16)8.7Asset Management (8)9.0Tracking of all physical assets (8)9.0HR Reporting (25)8.2Report builder (25)8.0Pre-built reports (25)8.3Ability to combine HR data with external data (18)8.3Onboarding (12)6.8New hire portal (11)7.1Manager tracking tools (11)6.5Performance and Goals (8)7.9Corporate goal setting (8)8.1Individual goal setting (8)7.8Line-of sight-visibility (7)7.9Performance tracking (8)7.6Performance Management (10)7.9Performance plans (10)8.0Performance improvement plans (8)7.8Review status tracking (8)7.7Review reminders (9)7.5Multiple review frequency (8)8.6Succession Planning (5)8.5Create succession plans/pools (5)8.7Candidate ranking (4)9.4Candidate search (5)7.9Candidate development (5)8.0Recruiting / ATS (9)6.8Job Requisition Management (9)7.0Company Website Posting (7)7.0Publish to Social Media (7)7.2Job Search Site Posting (8)6.0Duplicate Candidate Prevention (8)6.6Applicant Tracking (7)6.2Notifications and Alerts (8)7.6Workday HCM DescriptionWorkday Human Capital Management offers intuitive, self-service

What is HRMS?Core Human Resource (HR) Software, or Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), encompasses benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. These systems are also referred to as back-end HR systems since they help manage key administrative HR tasks, and are essentially the employee system of record. These core tasks are distinct from strategic HR tasks like performance management, recruiting, talent management, and learning management. 
HR Software and the Emergence of HCM Suites
The dividing line between various HR software categories is blurring. Many core HR vendors are offering adjacent capabilities in order to capture the attention being given to categories that are seen as more strategic vs. administrative. Talent management software, for example, is focused on helping companies hire, train and keep the highest quality staff. A number of core HR vendors are adding talent management capabilities, just as some talent management vendors are adding in back-end core HR capabilities. Ultimate Software, Oracle, ADP, and SilkRoad all offer some combination of core HR and talent management features. Few Human Capital Management Suites provide equally strong capabilities across all areas, but convergence is an important trend.
Core HR Software Features & CapabilitiesThe Core HR features common to most products
in this category are as follows:
Human Resource Management

The primary function of Core HR
software is to provide a central database containing records for all employees
past and present, along with contractors. These records contain data on
employee personal information, employment history, job profiles, workflow for
transfers, promotions, pay raises, benefits information, etc.
Payroll Management

Payroll management capabilities
provide for calculation of employee pay and benefits, in addition to managing
direct deposit, salary revisions and payroll tracking.
Leave and Attendance Management

Leave and attendance management streamlines communication between HR and employees, and
facilitates efficient management of employee leave including requisitions,
approvals, balance calculation, and annual carry-forward
Employee Self-Service

Provision of an
employee portal allowing employees to view and update their personal
information. This removes considerable administrative burden from HR staff.
Asset Management

Some Core HR systems
have the ability to keep a record of assets such as laptops, pagers, cell
phones, etc. issued to employees. The record typically includes asset type,
number, serial number and date of issuance.
Reporting

HR
reporting has come to be seen as more important than ever as HR data is not
seen as strategic to the running of any business. Some vendors build their own
reporting capabilities, while others partner with BI vendors to embed 3rd-party
functionality.Core HR Listings Listings   All Types   ListingsSearchListings (1-25 of 112)Sort by: Reviews | Highest Rated | Lowest Rated | Alphabetical | Product | Service(590) 8.3UltiProUltimate Software delivers cloud-based HCM solutions that help businesses accelerate talent acquisition, simplify payroll computations, manage time and attendance, and support proactive, strategic talent management.Reviews (460)AlternativesUltiPro Product Tour(328) 7.0ADP Workforce NowADP Workforce Now is an cloud-based HR platform for mid-sized businesses.Reviews (158)AlternativesCompare ADP Workforce Now(160) 8.1TriNetTriNet is an HR solution designed for small and midsized businesses.

Workday, Inc. is an on‑demand (cloud-based) financial management and human capital management software vendor. It was founded by David Duffield, founder and former CEO of ERP company PeopleSoft, and former PeopleSoft chief strategist Aneel Bhusri following Oracle's hostile takeover of PeopleSoft in 2005. It targets the customers of rivals Oracle or SAP. In October 2012, it launched a successful initial public offering that valued the company at $9.5 billion.[7]

Early history[edit]
Workday was founded in March 2005 and launched in November 2006.[8] Initially, it was funded by Duffield and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In December 2008, Workday moved its headquarters from Walnut Creek, California to Pleasanton, California, where PeopleSoft, founder Duffield's prior company, was located. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.[9][10]
On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]
Product[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2015)


Workday has released 27 updates to its product line as of September 2016. It releases a major update every 6 months.[citation needed]
Workday adopted the IBM Cloud as its primary development and testing platform in order to accelerate its worldwide expansion.[23]

On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

Workday, Inc. is an on‑demand (cloud-based) financial management and human capital management software vendor. It was founded by David Duffield, founder and former CEO of ERP company PeopleSoft, and former PeopleSoft chief strategist Aneel Bhusri following Oracle's hostile takeover of PeopleSoft in 2005. It targets the customers of rivals Oracle or SAP. In October 2012, it launched a successful initial public offering that valued the company at $9.5 billion.[7]

Early history[edit]
Workday was founded in March 2005 and launched in November 2006.[8] Initially, it was funded by Duffield and venture capital firm Greylock Partners. In December 2008, Workday moved its headquarters from Walnut Creek, California to Pleasanton, California, where PeopleSoft, founder Duffield's prior company, was located. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.[9][10]
On February 6, 2008, Workday announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase Cape Clear Software[11] In May 2008, Workday signed a large contract with Flextronics to provide human capital management software services.[12] Other large, multinational companies that have publicly disclosed contracts or deployments of Workday include Aviva,[13] Chiquita Brands,[14] CAE Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor,[15] Rentokil Initial,[16] Thomson Reuters,[17] and Time Warner.[18]
On April 29, 2009, Workday announced that it secured $75 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Existing investors Greylock Partners and Workday CEO and co‑founder Dave Duffield also participated in the round.[19] On October 24, 2011, Workday announced $85 million in new funding, bringing total capital raised to $250 million. Investors in the latest round included T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Janus, and Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment entity of Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.[20]
The current CEO and Chairman of Workday is Aneel Bhusri, who is a partner with Greylock Partners and handled senior leadership positions earlier in his career at PeopleSoft.
Initial public offering[edit]
As of spring 2012, Workday had 310 customers, ranging from mid-sized businesses to Fortune 500 companies.[21] In October 2012, Workday launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol WDAY. Its shares were priced at $28 and ended trading Friday, October 12, at $48.69, "propelled the start-up to a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion including unexercised stock options." It sold 22.75 million Class A shares, raising $637 million. The IPO raised more cash than any launch in the U.S. technology sector since Facebook's $16 billion IPO in May 2012. Its shares surged 74% in their IPO, underscoring investor interest in cloud computing.[7]
Business model[edit]
Workday makes money by selling subscriptions to its services rather than selling the software outright. Expenses are booked up front when it signs on a new customer but the associated revenue is recognized over the life of multiyear agreements. In first quarter 2016, Workday announced annual revenue in excess of $1 billion for the first time ever in fiscal year 2016.[22]
Corporate governance[edit]
Duffield holds voting rights to Workday shares that were worth $3.4 billion and Bhusri held rights to shares valued at $1.3 billion. Collectively, they hold 67% of the company's voting shares. This voting structure makes the event of a hostile takeover much more unlikely.[7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
