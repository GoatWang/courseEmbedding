      	Gilbert M. Grosvenor  2010


      	National Geographic Society      
      Gilbert M. Grosvenor, chairman of the National Geographic Society Board of Trustees, has been chosen by the board of the National Press Foundation to receive the W.M. Kiplinger Award for Distinguished Contributions to Journalism. The award carries a $1,000 honorarium and an engraved crystal vase. All of NPF’s major awards are presented at our annual awards dinner, which this year takes place on March 1, 2011, from 6:30 – 9:30 pm, at the Hilton Washington.

The selection committee said in its unanimous report to the board: “Mr. Grosvenor has steered a venerable print institution into the digital age, achieving great distinction through its websites, television programs, films and educational efforts. He has helped shape how we view our world, a rare accomplishment.”

The award is named in honor of W.M. Kiplinger, the founder and editor of the Kiplinger family of financial publications. The judges for the Kiplinger award this year were Austin Kiplinger, Chairman of Kiplinger Washington Editors; Knight Kiplinger, Editor-in-Chief and President, Kiplinger Washington Letter; Susan Swain, co-president of C-SPAN; Stephen G. Smith, editor of The Examiner and Mike Tackett, Washington Bureau Chief, Bloomberg News.

Previous winners of the Kiplinger Award include Bill Kovach, founding chairman of the Committee of Concerned Journalists; Tom Friedman of The New York Times; and Linda Johnson Rice, among many others. You can find more information about the Kiplinger award here.

The National Press Foundation is a 501-c-3 which conducts educational programs for journalists and issues awards for accomplishments. We conduct about 45-50 days of programming around the U.S., and internationally. All of our programs are on-the-record, free to selected journalists and all expenses are paid. The foundation accepts contributions from non-profits, for-profits and individuals. The annual awards dinner is our largest source of unrestricted revenue.

Other winners to be honored on March 1, 2011 include Andrea Mitchell, chief foreign affairs correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC; Mark Silverman, editor of the Tennessean; and Matt Wuerker, editorial cartoonist for POLITICO.

Interview with Gilbert Melville Grosvenor
                        Chairman, National Geographic Education Foundation
                        Member, National Geographic Board of Trustees

Introduction:
From an early age, Gil Grosvenor met, with interest, the explorers who were visiting his father and grandfather in Washington D.C., in their work at the National Geographic Society.  Although he was meeting interesting people and respected what his family was up to at the Geographic, it was not his early intent to follow in their footsteps, as they had in those of his great-grandfather, Alexander Graham Bell, and great-great grandfather, and Society founder, Gardiner Greene Hubbard.  What changed the mind of the man who eventually served as editor of National Geographic Magazine from 1970 to 1980, then as the National Geographic Society president from 1980 to 1996.
Vernon Holleman sat down with Gil at the end of 2010 to discuss his succession story in an organization known as well as any on the planet.  This interview series is about hearing real stories first hand and learning the lessons our guests have learned from their experiences.  Gil helps the listener understand what brought him to the Society and the family dynamic issues he dealt with while there.

Among other topics, Gil discusses the following issues with Vernon Holleman III, CLU:

Family Influence to Enter
Following Legends - a Firsthand Look

Background:
Gilbert M. Grosvenor as a childGilbert M. Grosvenor is chairman of the National Geographic Society's Education Foundation and is a member of the Society's board of trustees. He retired on Dec. 31, 2010, as chairman of the board, a position he had held since 1987. Grosvenor was president of National Geographic from 1980 to 1996, the fifth generation of his family to serve in that position.
                    Grosvenor was born on May 5, 1931, in Washington, D.C. He graduated from Yale University in 1954 and joined the Society staff that year as a picture editor. He was editor of National Geographic magazine from 1970 to 1980, when he became the Society's 14th president. He has served as a member of the board of trustees since 1966.
In 1975, concerned about the lack of geographic knowledge among students, Grosvenor created National Geographic World (now National Geographic Kids), a monthly magazine for children. In 1985 he launched an effort to improve geography education in the nation's classrooms. The Society's Geography Education Outreach division and its local partners have invested more than $110 million in improving geography in America's K-12 schools.
In June 2004 Grosvenor received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is a director or trustee of several foundations and corporations, including Chevy Chase Trust and Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. He is a member emeritus of the Board of Visitors of Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment; former vice chairman of the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors; and former member of the President's Commission on Environmental Quality.
