Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

 "I ordered the Coach HC6013 Eyeglasses Julayne. I received them exactly one week after ordering them. They are PERFECT! They came with the original case, original lenses, and cloth wipe. I couldnt be more pleased with the service and my glasses. I have referred several friends and Im sure this will not be my last order."

 "I got the delivery today. It took 7-8 days for shipment after placing the order.. But the wait was worth.. This is same as available in stores, but yes with low price" 













 Roshana  (California)






 "I purchased these for half the retail price. I am so happy with my purchase. It took 15 days for me to get it, but the price and the great communication I received from Diana made it all worth the wait."
