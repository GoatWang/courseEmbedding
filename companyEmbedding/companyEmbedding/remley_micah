EnerNOC Vice President of Product Strategy and Technology, Micah Remley, Named to Boston Business Journal's 2013 "40 Under 40"

BOSTON, Sept. 13, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EnerNOC, Inc. (Nasdaq:ENOC), a leading provider of energy intelligence software, today announced that Micah Remley, EnerNOC's Vice President of Product Strategy and Technology, has been named to Boston Business Journal's 2013 "40 Under 40" List, an honor that recognizes "Boston's best and brightest young professionals." This year's honorees were chosen by a panel of editors based on their influence on local business and 
industry, driving the overall health of the Boston economy. Volunteer work and other forms of philanthropy were also factored into the selection process.


 "EnerNOC is helping to change the way the world uses energy through software-based tools and analytics, and it is exciting to be a part of that transformation. This award is really more of a recognition of our team's collective efforts to change the status quo of energy management than it is an individual honor," said Remley.


 "Micah truly embodies EnerNOC's culture of hiring 'bright, relentless, and good' people. He is committed to everything he does inside and outside of work, bringing an energy and passion that is hard to rival," said Tim Healy, Chairman and CEO of EnerNOC.


 Prior to his role as VP of Product Strategy and Technology, Micah served as EnerNOC's Vice President of Operations where he managed an operations team of over 200 people responsible for executing thousands of megawatts of demand response dispatches every year. He was also a key driver in setting the strategic course for EnerNOC's big data initiative, based on the collection of billions of energy data points to enable better energy management decision making by commercial, institutional, and industrial energy users.


 Outside of work, Remley is an avid endurance sports participant and dedicated bike commuter. He is a past member of the Board of Directors of the Washington Trails Association, which protects hiking trails and wild lands, and promotes hiking as a healthy way to connect to the outdoors. He currently volunteers for Lincoln Youth Soccer, and coaches two youth soccer teams.
