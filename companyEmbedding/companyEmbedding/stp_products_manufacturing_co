Engine Deposits Explained | STP® Fuel Treatment and Maintenance














 











THANK YOU!



Thank for registering with STP®
Please check your email for news and offers from us soon.

See the Difference


SEE THE DIFFERENCE
 
An inside look at an engine treated with STP® Complete Fuel System Cleaner.
 
The Problem
In both old and new engines, impurities in gasoline can cause harmful deposits to form in fuel injectors, intake valves, and combustion chambers – in less than 3,000 miles – and cause:

Lower gas mileage
Poor acceleration and lost power
Hard starts
Auto ignition (knock and ping)
Increased exhaust emissions

 
The Solution
STP® Complete Fuel System Cleaner – our strongest formula – contains powerful detergents to help remove harmful deposits. One tank treatment helps clean the entire fuel system – including fuel injectors, intake valves and even hard-to-reach combustion chambers – to help optimize engine performance.
Scientific Proof
Step inside a test facility as we compare two engines. Both were run for the same amount of miles with the same gasoline. Then one engine was treated with STP® Complete Fuel System Cleaner. See for yourself how it can help fight harmful engine deposits to maintain optimum performance.

Product QuickStart Services
We are here to provide as much, or as little support as you need.








Strategic Advisory Session


$250 +
Can your product be manufactured?  What can be improved?  If you're not sure what the next step is on the path toward a product launch, or if you just want to bounce some ideas off experienced product launchers, a strategic advisory session might be the best first step.  We can spend as little, or as much time with you as you need to determine how or if to proceed.  In many cases, we can help clients streamline their project plans in just a few hours.
 






Idea Audit / Analysis


$1,500 +
A Product QuickStart audit package starts with an analysis of your product idea, concept, or prototype.  Our team will evaluate your program based on technical feasibility, development challenges, aesthetics, industrial design, and manufacturing options.  The report we create helps clients make an informed go/no-go decision about their program.
 












Product Success Plan


$2,000 +
Don't be surprised by downstream development costs or timelines.  Let Product QuickStart develop a custom project plan for your program, identifying significant milestones, stage-gates, and long lead time items and activities.  Project plans we develop serve as invaluable road maps for developing and manufacturing your product, and help keep you on track toward your product launch goals.
 






Product Visualization


$2,000 +
Product QuickStart adds substance, excitement, and depth to our clients' crowdfunding campaign and investor presentations. We provide CAD-based photo-realistic renderings to help you build the vision of what your product will achieve.  In this engagement, we also provide a strong framework of understanding of development costs, manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and development schedule so you know how much capital you need to raise, and how long before you will be shipping product.
 















Product Animation


$3,000 +
Sometimes a static image just isn't enough to communicate the full functionality or uniqueness of a new product.  That's why Product QuickStart offers a variety of product animation options.  Show your prospective customers and investors your product from every angle.  Demonstrate how your product works or how it assembles.  An animation can add a whole new depth of reality to your product concept.
 






Prototypes


Priced by Project
Many projects need a robust, demonstrable working prototype in order to attain funding for development and manufacturing ramp up.  Some crowdfunding portals, like Kickstarter, require product or technology based projects to have a working prototype to be eligible to raise funds.  Product QuickStart provides high quality prototype design, development, fabrication, and testing.  With our prototypes, clients have the opportunity to demonstrate their innovations in a very real, very powerful way.
 












Industrial Design


Priced by Project
Our Industrial Designers have worked on a broad range of projects, from medical equipment to cars.  We start with rapid hand visualization concepts and move quickly to 3D CAD models.  Our designers work closely with the engineers and manufacturing team to make sure what they develop is well thought out and has future manufacturing possibilities.
 






Engineering


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart engineers have experience developing products for many industries. They all have years of experience in the product development industry and are masters of working hand in hand with designers.  Our engineers well help bridge the gap between design and manufacturing to make the product development process as smooth as possible for you.
 












Manufacturing & Fulfillment


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart builds robust supply chains for our clients through a network of hundreds of vetted, audited suppliers.  We manufacture product both domestically and offshore, and we are not tied to any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.  Being supplier-independent gives us the freedom to design your product and your supply chain around your needs, instead of steering you toward a factory that we need to fill to capacity.  We are masters of quality control and supply chain reliability.

Product QuickStart Services
We are here to provide as much, or as little support as you need.








Strategic Advisory Session


$250 +
Can your product be manufactured?  What can be improved?  If you're not sure what the next step is on the path toward a product launch, or if you just want to bounce some ideas off experienced product launchers, a strategic advisory session might be the best first step.  We can spend as little, or as much time with you as you need to determine how or if to proceed.  In many cases, we can help clients streamline their project plans in just a few hours.
 






Idea Audit / Analysis


$1,500 +
A Product QuickStart audit package starts with an analysis of your product idea, concept, or prototype.  Our team will evaluate your program based on technical feasibility, development challenges, aesthetics, industrial design, and manufacturing options.  The report we create helps clients make an informed go/no-go decision about their program.
 












Product Success Plan


$2,000 +
Don't be surprised by downstream development costs or timelines.  Let Product QuickStart develop a custom project plan for your program, identifying significant milestones, stage-gates, and long lead time items and activities.  Project plans we develop serve as invaluable road maps for developing and manufacturing your product, and help keep you on track toward your product launch goals.
 






Product Visualization


$2,000 +
Product QuickStart adds substance, excitement, and depth to our clients' crowdfunding campaign and investor presentations. We provide CAD-based photo-realistic renderings to help you build the vision of what your product will achieve.  In this engagement, we also provide a strong framework of understanding of development costs, manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and development schedule so you know how much capital you need to raise, and how long before you will be shipping product.
 















Product Animation


$3,000 +
Sometimes a static image just isn't enough to communicate the full functionality or uniqueness of a new product.  That's why Product QuickStart offers a variety of product animation options.  Show your prospective customers and investors your product from every angle.  Demonstrate how your product works or how it assembles.  An animation can add a whole new depth of reality to your product concept.
 






Prototypes


Priced by Project
Many projects need a robust, demonstrable working prototype in order to attain funding for development and manufacturing ramp up.  Some crowdfunding portals, like Kickstarter, require product or technology based projects to have a working prototype to be eligible to raise funds.  Product QuickStart provides high quality prototype design, development, fabrication, and testing.  With our prototypes, clients have the opportunity to demonstrate their innovations in a very real, very powerful way.
 












Industrial Design


Priced by Project
Our Industrial Designers have worked on a broad range of projects, from medical equipment to cars.  We start with rapid hand visualization concepts and move quickly to 3D CAD models.  Our designers work closely with the engineers and manufacturing team to make sure what they develop is well thought out and has future manufacturing possibilities.
 






Engineering


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart engineers have experience developing products for many industries. They all have years of experience in the product development industry and are masters of working hand in hand with designers.  Our engineers well help bridge the gap between design and manufacturing to make the product development process as smooth as possible for you.
 












Manufacturing & Fulfillment


Priced by Project
Product QuickStart builds robust supply chains for our clients through a network of hundreds of vetted, audited suppliers.  We manufacture product both domestically and offshore, and we are not tied to any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.  Being supplier-independent gives us the freedom to design your product and your supply chain around your needs, instead of steering you toward a factory that we need to fill to capacity.  We are masters of quality control and supply chain reliability.
