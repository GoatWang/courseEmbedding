SCUBA Diving





The Cayman Islands are world-famous for spectacular scuba diving - warm
water, light current, outstanding visibility, beautiful marine life, and
first-class dive operators. Dive operators are located on or near our
properties and discounted diving packages are offered. Please call our
reservations office at 1-800-999-1338 for info. You can also book a
Dive/Condo Package online for a stay at Sunset Cove directly through DNS
Diving by visiting their website http://dnsdiving.com/dive-stay-packages/.

If you are not a certified diver, you can still experience scuba diving by signing up for a "discover diving" class ("resort course"). After an equipment and safety orientation, you learn some basic skills in a pool. Then board the dive boat and accompany your instructor on a guided dive to one of the offshore coral reefs. All equipment is included. If you get hooked, full certification courses are available. Or complete the classroom and pool work at home, then come to the Cayman Islands for your open water dives!






Snorkeling





Some of the best snorkeling on the island can be found along Seven Mile Beach. Tropical fish are abundant just offshore as well as at the coral reefs located a short swim into the sparkling waters of the Caribbean Sea. If you need equipment, it can be rented.

Don't miss going on a North Sound snorkel trip. Dive for conch, eat your catch and enjoy a fresh seafood lunch, snorkel the reef, and play with the rays at famous "Stingray City." Our staff can steer you towards the best boats.






Beaches





Enjoy the warmth of the Caribbean sun and the relaxation and serenity of world famous Seven Mile Beach. After a few days of fun on Seven Mile Beach, take a drive to Rum Point and relax and enjoy the quiet north side of the island. All beaches in the Cayman Islands are public up to the high water mark.






Golf





You can play a round or two of golf at the North Sound Golf Club which is the only public 18-hole championship course on Grand Cayman.  Visitors can take advantage of all-inclusive memberships, seasonal packages, golf instruction from PGA professionals, full-service practice facility, and golf club rentals on this 71, 6605 yard course.  Signature hole #11 is a long par-3 playing into the wind with the North Sound waters as the majestic backdrop....a must for photo enthusiasts! 







Water Sports





Grand Cayman is famous for crystal clear water, light currents, and awesome reefs and sea life – making it one of the top SCUBA diving and snorkeling spots in the world. But there are many other exciting water sports available on the island. 

Water Toys
Waverunners, sailboats, sea kayaks, sailboards, parasailing, glass-bottom boats, and sunset cruises are available from several water sports operators on Seven Mile Beach.

Fishing
You can catch an unbelievable variety of reef fish on a snorkel trip with a Caymanian captain. Those who are really serious can arrange deep sea fishing.

North Sound Trip
The highlight of many Grand Cayman vacations is a boat trip into the North Sound. Dive for conch (in season), eat your catch, enjoy a seafood lunch prepared by the crew, snorkel the reef and "Coral Gardens." All trips, including half-day, stop at famous Stingray City where you can play with and feed the Stringrays in shallow water. Our staff can steer you towards the best boats.






Sunsets




Sunsets off Seven Mile Beach are spectacular!








Dining




There are many excellent restaurants on Grand Cayman. Dining runs the entire spectrum – from fine dining (many have outdoor seating available), to island food, to fast food. One thing they all have in common: dress is almost uniformly "island casual." Also, most restaurants are good – the bad ones don’t last more than a year. As restaurants change, we send a list of our current recommendations with your confirmation package.





Other Island Attractions





Seven Mile Beach — Rated as one of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean. 7 Mile Beach is a long stretch of white sand located on Grand Cayman.
Boatswains Beach — A park that houses Grand Cayman’s famous Turtle Farm. Get up close and personal with the Green Sea Turtles. Other attractions include snorkeling lagoons, bird watching, and scheduled shark feedings. Also check out Cayman Street, a “living museum” pathway with traditional buildings where local artisans demonstrate Caymanian crafts, gardening, and cooking.
Stingray City — Take a boat tour to the world famous snorkel and dive site in the North Sound that allows visitors to feed and pet the curious and friendly Southern Stingrays that inhabit these waters.
Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park — A 65-acre nature preserve where you can observe the beautiful flowers and plants of the Cayman Islands, a butterfly farm, and the endangered Grand Cayman Blue Iguana.
Cayman Islands National Museum — Observe the history and culture of the Cayman Islands which has been preserved in the heart of the capital, Georgetown.
Pedro St. James Historic Site — A restored 18th century colonial “castle” by the sea.
Hell — View these interesting rock formations that resemble flames frozen in place, and even send a postcard from the Hell post office.
Blowholes in East End — Visit the shoreline formations that send the waves shooting skyward along the more rugged and unspoiled coastline of the East End.
Rum Point — The atmosphere at this beach on the North Sound is truly relaxed. Sip your favorite island concoction from a hammock on this tree shaded beach.
