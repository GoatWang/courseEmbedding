The L.S. Starrett Company, founded in 1880, manufactures more than 5,000 variations of Precision Tools, Gages, Measuring Instruments and Saw Blades for industrial, professional and consumer markets worldwide.
Starrett, a leader who has set the standard for fine precision tools in industry for over 130 years, has rightfully earned the title, "World's Greatest Toolmakers".
"Like all businesses, however large or complex, this one started with a man and an idea. The man was Laroy S. Starrett; his idea was 'to invent something useful that people would want.' Countless others have had a similar idea, the difference here was in the quality of the man. L.S. Starrett’s outstanding characteristic was confidence in himself; he was a man who in spite of one setback after another refused to admit defeat. He had unusual ability, vision and enterprise, but without his high courage this story of the foundation and growth of 'the world’s greatest toolmakers' could never have been written..."

Wall and Main: Athol’s Starrett struggles







Sunday
Sep 18, 2016 at 3:00 PM
Sep 25, 2016 at 3:00 PM






				By Peter S. CohanWALL & MAIN
			
As Starrett goes, so goes Athol.
And things are not great at this family-run maker of hand tools, saw blades, gauges, measuring systems, and other construction-related tools.
The L.S. Starrett Co.’s stock has dropped, it has cut employees, and that has nicked Athol’s civic pride.
The company has a proud history. Its founder, Laroy S. Starrett, was a Maine native who grew up on a farm and excelled at inventing tools. According to the company’s latest annual report, he founded the company in 1880, and incorporated it in 1929. Starrett now makes “over 5,000 measuring and cutting products for industrial markets — concentrating in metalworking, construction, machinery, equipment, aerospace and automotive, as well as professional and consumer markets which are sold throughout North America and in over 100 other countries. It operates in Athol, (starting in 1880); Mt. Airy, North Carolina (1985); Itu, Brazil (1956); Jedburgh, Scotland (1958) and Suzhou, China (1997).”
Starrett’s stock started well, but has had a choppy 21st century. Company shares rose at a 10.3 percent annual rate between January 1978, at $5.75 a share, and April 1998, peaking at $40.81 apiece. The company had its Initial Public Offering in 1929.
Since then, things have not been as great for shareholders. The company’s stock fell to $11.65 in June 2003 — a low from which it more than doubled to $26.25 in August 2008 — before plunging to $5.60 in March 2009 at the bottom of the financial crisis.
In retrospect, that would have been a good time to buy the stock, since its shares more than tripled to $21.72 by February 2015. Sadly, the shares have gone downhill since then, suffering a blow after the company announced its latest earnings in August, bringing them down by half to $10.51 as of Sept. 12.
The drop in Starrett's stock price appears to be a consequence of investors’ disappointment with its most recent earnings results. For the year ending June 30, 2016, Starrett reported a roughly 13 percent drop in revenues, to about $210 million, and a $14.1 million net loss after earning $5.2 million in the previous year.
Starrett blamed forces outside its control for the decline. According to its latest annual report, Starrett, "as a global company, was negatively impacted by political, economic and currency issues during fiscal 2016. The recession, corruption and currency problems in Brazil significantly reduced the sales and profits of our largest international subsidiary compared to fiscal 2015. The slowdown in China and stagnation in Europe resulted in lower sales compared to fiscal 2015 in both regions, while North America suffered from the cost reductions implemented in the oil industry.”
Starrett also fingered financial markets for its woes, arguing that lower interest rates and accounting rules forced it take a charge against the value of its pension fund. “The financial markets, including the timing of Brexit, also reduced earnings in fiscal 2016, as the flight to safety increased the demand for bonds and the associated decrease in interest rates, which significantly contributed to a $17.5 million non-cash pension expense due to higher liabilities. This generally accepted accounting principle, coupled with the volatility of interest rates results in fourth quarter financial variations which management cannot control,” according to its annual report.
Starrett is falling behind its rivals. According to financial information provider Morningstar, over the last three years the company’s revenues have declined an average of 4.9 percent, while the industry has suffered a 0.3 percent decline. Starrett’s net profit margin is negative 6.7 percent — far worse than the positive 6.7 percent earned by the industry.
In January 2015, one analyst argued that Starrett is hampered by family control, and too much loyalty to its workers. According to Janek Boski’s Seeking Alpha column, “The company continues to be run by generational family members of the founder. The family continues to maintain control given the 10-1 voting rights that the family owns through its Class B shares (Class B shares outstanding were at 787,109 and Class A were at 6,182,016 outstanding on Sept. 30, 2014). Douglas A. Starrett, the current CEO, is destroying shareholder value by refusing to cut labor in the US. It appears that the family may be continuing to uphold Laroy Starrett's legacy by keeping its U.S. employees as part of the family business, resulting in a poor performance by the company over the last decade.”
And in Starrett’s latest fiscal year, it appears to have heeded Mr. Boski’s call, reducing the number of people it employs by 56 U.S. workers and 54 international ones, ending the fiscal year with 1,694 employees, which was 6.1 percent below the year before.
Despite the weak financial performance, Starrett rewarded its CEO, giving Mr. Starrett a hefty 16.9 percent raise in fiscal 2016, according to the company’s 2016 proxy. His total compensation of $1.02 million included a 5.7 percent salary increase to $425,000 and a 36 percent pop to $480,315 in the value of his pension, both slightly offset by a 3.4 percent cut in his stock awards to $109,830.
Starrett reduced headcount to rid itself of excess saw products capacity and believes its stock is undervalued. As chief financial officer, Frank O’Brien explained in a September 15 interview, “We reduced headcount at our saw products plants in Scotland, North Carolina, Brazil, and China. Athol was not affected because we make precision hand tools here. We increased Mr. Starrett’s salary on the basis of a recommendation from a compensation consultant based on last year’s performance and neither Doug nor I are taking raises in fiscal 2017. It’s hard to tell if our revenues will increase in the coming year – a big part of it has to do with the strong dollar relative to currencies in Brazil, Canada, Mexico China, and Europe. And our stock is under-valued – it trades below $10 while our book value is $13 or $14 and we pay a 4 percent dividend yield. Where else can you get that?”
It seems to me that blaming outside forces for its revenue decline – a problem that job cuts won’t solve - does not bode well for Athol or Starrett shareholders.
