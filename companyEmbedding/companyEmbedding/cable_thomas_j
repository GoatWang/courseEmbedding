Thomas J. Wlodkowski Joins Comcast Cable as Vice President of 
      Accessibility






July 16, 2012 09:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast 
      Cable, one of the nation's leading providers of entertainment, 
      information and communications products and services, announced today 
      that Thomas J. Wlodkowski has joined the company as Vice President of 
      Accessibility. In this newly created role, Mr. Wlodkowski will develop a 
      strategic plan focused on the usability of Comcast’s products and 
      services by people with disabilities and pursue opportunities to further 
      enrich the customer experience for the disability community. He reports 
      to Charlie Herrin, Senior Vice President, Product Design and 
      Development, Comcast Cable.
    


      “Comcast is developing new and innovative communication technologies at 
      a rate that is faster than ever before. It is extremely important that 
      our products and services are easily available and functional for 
      everyone to be able to use these technologies that have become essential 
      for communication, education and entertainment,” said Mr. Herrin. “We 
      are thrilled to have Tom join our team as he brings a wealth of 
      knowledge that will help us to better serve our customers with 
      disabilities through our new and current products.”
    

      Mr. Wlodkowski joins Comcast from AOL, Inc. where he led accessibility 
      for the past decade. Among his many accomplishments there, he oversaw 
      the launch of AIM Relay, which allows people who are deaf, hard of 
      hearing or speech disabled to place phone calls to their friends and 
      family through telecommunication relay services.
    

      Mr. Wlodkowski holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston College. He 
      currently sits on the Board of Trustees for the American Foundation for 
      the Blind and is a member of the Loudoun County Disability Services 
      Board. He previously served on the FCC Consumer Advisory Committee and 
      the Board of Trustees for the National Braille Press. Mr. Wlodkowski 
      will be relocating to the Philadelphia area with his wife and son.
