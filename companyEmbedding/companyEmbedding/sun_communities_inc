            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

COMPANY NEWS

                    SUN COMMUNITIES IN $93 MILLION DEAL WITH PARK REALTY                
Sun Communities Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy nine manufactured housing communities from partnerships managed by Park Realty Inc. for about $93 million. The properties are in the Southwest, Indiana and Florida. Sun, which is based in Farmington Hills, Mich., did not provide details about the agreement or about the properties. Sun Communities is among the biggest renters of property to owners of manufactured and mobile homes. It owns and operates 85 communities with about 30,000 developed sites.











                    Sun Is Willing to Offer Cash for Chateau Properties                
Sun Communities Inc., one of the three publicly traded mobile home park operators currently wooing shareholders of Chateau Properties Inc., said yesterday that it was willing to offer cash for Chateau shares. Gary A. Shiffman, president of Sun, said the company indicated a willingness to pay cash in its original letter to Chateau's board on Aug. 20, but that investors were not privy to that offer. ''That was the purpose of this new letter, to reiterate our positions,'' he said, referring to a second letter to Chateau's board that Sun released yesterday. ''One of the alternatives that Sun would consider would be a cash alternative to Chateau's common shareholders.''










Market Place

                    Zell, in a Bid To Buy REIT, Says Managers Have a Conflict                
Mobile-home parks have become the unlikely stage for the latest tussle over corporate governance, and the outcome could have a big impact on the stock price of many of the largest publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Sam Zell, the Chicago financier who has made a fortune buying property and companies that no one else wanted until after he bought them, is complaining that a quirk in the capital structure of many real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, creates a schism between the interests of management and those of their shareholders.











                    Sun Communities Bid Creates a Battle for Chateau Properties                
Sun Communities Inc. offered yesterday to buy rival Chateau Properties Inc. for $370 million in stock, setting the stage for a showdown among the largest owners of mobile-home parks. Sun's offer of $24.75 a share came two days after Manufactured Home Communities Inc., which is controlled by Sam Zell, the Chicago investor, offered to buy Chateau for $26 a share, or $387 million, in cash.










COMPANY NEWS

                    SUN COMMUNITIES TO BUY MANUFACTURED HOUSING GROUPS                
Sun Communities Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire 25 manufactured housing communities, mostly in Michigan and Florida, from Aspen Enterprises Ltd. for $226 million. Sun Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Farmington Hills, Mich., plans to raise funds for the transaction by issuing common stock, debt and partnership stakes. The funds will also be used to retire $64 million of debt and to convert the company's secured line of credit to an unsecured facility. Sun Communities stock was unchanged yesterday at $26.625, but the deal was announced after the close of trading.
