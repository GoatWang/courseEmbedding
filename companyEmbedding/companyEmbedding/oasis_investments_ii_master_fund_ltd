It's time to take your life back Get Oasis Express Cash now.











 How it Works The accident wasn't your fault, but...


You're struggling 
to pay your bills.




You're afraid 
you may have to 
settle too soon.








How Oasis Financial can be your lifeline:


Get legal funding before your lawsuit settles—from $500 to $500,000.




Get it within hours to pay ongoing bills and keep life as normal and stress-free as possible.




With no risk: You owe nothing unless you're successful with your claim (no application or upfront out-of-pocket fees). 
If you lose your case, you don't pay us back.








  What type of case do you have? The most common cases are listed below. Call toll-free 877.333.6675 to confirm that you qualify.







Auto Accident


Workers Comp


Civil Rights


Construction Negligence


FELA (Railroad)


General Negligence 


Jones Act (Maritime)


Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury


Pedestrian Injury


Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)


Workplace Negligence


Wrongful Death













Auto Accident
Many auto accident claims do not settle quickly. Being injured is bad enough, but if you’re unable to work, life becomes that much harder. As bills pile up, people often feel pressure to settle their cases early for less than the fair value. An Oasis Financial cash lifeline gives you and your attorney breathing room, so you’re not forced to take the defendant’s first offer. 




Workers Comp
Almost half of all work place injuries are serious enough to cause the employee to miss work or require ongoing medical care. Worker’s Compensation laws were created to protect injured workers by providing for medical care, compensation for lost wages related to the injury and rehabilitation and/or retraining if necessary. 

Because paying these claims can be costly, employers don’t always believe they are legitimate, creating undue delays in resolving them. In addition, defendants often don’t even make an initial offer. They want to pay zero—more reason than ever to give your attorney time to win a fair settlement.*

 
*Oasis does not work with Workers Compensation cases in Alaska, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, or Wyoming.




Civil Rights
These claims can result from a wide variety of discriminatory misconduct, including misconduct regarding age, disability, pregnancy, race and religious discrimination—as well as different types of harassment charges. While the actions prompting these claims may not leave a person with a physical injury, they can cause significant stress for the claimant and their family—negatively impacting the family’s financial situation. Civil rights cases often take years to settle.




Construction Negligence
The reality of construction litigation is that even with an experienced lawyer and a well-documented case, the legal process can move slowly. Defendants aren’t likely to step up and provide a quick resolution with a fair award. More commonly, the defendant will offer a small amount, hoping the claimant is financially needy enough to take it.




FELA (Railroad)
Similar to Workers Comp, the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA) provides compensation for railroad workers injured on the job. Almost any worker employed by a railroad company, even those whose primary responsibilities are not performed in or around trains, is protected under the FELA. 

The degree of negligence the plaintiff must show under the FELA (usually due to the railroad, its employees or an equipment manufacturer) is actually less than “no fault” Workers Comp. However, FELA requires a higher burden of proof by the courts than Workers Comp, so FELA litigation can last much longer.




General Negligence 
Negligence lawsuits cover a broad range of specific complaints including: animal bites, amusement park injuries, bicycle and pedestrian accidents, plus homeowner and nursing home negligence. Since these cases are expensive and time-consuming to defend, the defendant will probably want to settle quickly, but that rarely means the amount offered will be fair.




Jones Act (Maritime)
Like FELA described above, the Jones Act was signed into law to protect maritime workers involved in accidents while at work. As you would expect, claimants must prove that their employers were negligent or “at fault.” 

However, “comparative fault” is involved here. if the employer can prove that the plaintiff’s actions contributed to or caused the accident, the amount of the award can be reduced accordingly. This clause is why nearly all employers will immediately blame plaintiffs for their own accidents—and why these cases can take so long to settle.




Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury
See Auto Accident




Pedestrian Injury
Did you know that, on average, a pedestrian is injured every seven minutes?** Collisions with motor vehicle or bicycles, or injuries due to unsafe conditions, can happen anytime. If you’ve sustained injuries through another party’s negligence, you may already know that the legal process moves slowly, even with a strong case.
 
**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2012, Pedestrian Safety, “How big is the problem.”





Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)
If you were injured on another’s property and the property owner failed to warn you of the possible hazard, the owner may be found negligent and liable. Premise liability lawsuits encompass a wide range of accidents, but “slip and fall” cases are the most common. 

This type of injury can occur on private or public property and can be caused by uneven or cracked sidewalks, poorly lit pathways, slippery or unbalanced floors, potholes, ripped carpet or rugs, and even bad weather.




Workplace Negligence
A job-related injury is typically covered by Workers Comp insurance. However, if the injury involved negligence on the part of the employer, a fellow employee or a product, tool or machine produced by a third party, a workplace negligence lawsuit may be filed. These are often handled outside of the state-specific Workers Comp “no-fault” claims process.

Since these cases are not considered “no fault,” it is the claimant’s burden to prove that the other party is liable. This can lead to a long, contentious fight.




Wrongful Death
There are no words to describe the loss of a loved one, especially due to a senseless accident caused by the actions or negligence of someone else. In addition to taking a terrible emotional toll on those left behind, the wrongful death of a loved one can also create significant financial hardships.













 If you lose, you don’t have to pay us back.
 Our share of the case's potential proceeds varies according to several factors. Pay nothing out of pocket—payment comes out of the award or settlement amount. Owe nothing if you don't win your case. 













  How to Qualify Checklist Say “yes” to the 2 statements below and you’ve met the initial requirements. Final approval is subject to our underwriting standards. We tend to fund 5-10% of the value of your claim (this is part part of the approval process).

Mark/Buford GA

Joyce/Palm Bay FL


“Oasis was very kind. I told them about my ordeal 
and they were very sympathetic to me.”
Rosaline/Union NJ

saved their business and their marriage!"

Tulsa/OK Attorney


“Mary lost her job from the accident, but was able to get a job interview. To get there, she needed money to fix a flat tire. As a single mom, she also needed school supplies. Now she can provide for her children in all ways with the funds."
Holiday/FL Attorney


“Oasis is the most upfront company. They made sure I understood everything.”
Richard/Vidalia LA

Fort Pierce/FL Attorney


"After approval, Teneka was very excited and said, "Are you kidding me?" She was happy she could finally pay her bills."
Cedar Hills/TX Attorney


"Ashlee was involved in an auto accident with a drunken driver. Since then, she’s been struggling physically and financially—with numerous surgeries and being homeless. She needed funds before the weekend, and we were able to get her the money in less than two hours. She was so grateful and impressed at how quickly it happened."
Beckly/WV Attorney


"James desperately needed to pay his light bill and his mortgage. He was very happy when I told him he was approved. With the money left over he was going to take his ‘little ones’ to McDonald's as a treat. He said it'd been a long time."
Tampa/FL Attorney


"When Oasis sent me the money, I was jumping up and down inside.  My wife and I were relieved inside that we didn’t have the creditors breathing down our neck."
William/Chicago IL

Focus on Companies: Oasis Investment Limited


Written on November 13, 2012 by Tom Sanderson in Company Focus



Despite what some observers see as a slow-down in the Asian investments sector, there are several hedge funds that have proven these observers to be too pessimistic. Take for example the recently launched Oasis Investments Limited fund, which had an extraordinary beginning.
During the first 14 months of investing with its internal funds the global market-neutral, multi-strategy, multi-asset fund returned at a 100 percent annualized rate, setting the stage for much excitement when the fund finally opened its doors to outside investors in the late summer of 2011.
The goal of Oasis Investments Limited, whose Oasis Investments Master Fund II will continued the investment strategies of its first 14 months is to reach total assets under management of $1 billion.
The interest expressed in Oasis Investments Limited is part of a more general trend of increased interest in the Asian marketplace. Hedge funds have added $93.9 billion to the industry from investors during the first four months of the year, topping the previous year’s increase of only $28 billion during the corresponding four months.
It is true that hedge funds are still behind the $192 billion where they were at the end of December, 2007 when the international financial crisis first reared its head. However the past year has shown net positive flows into the industry, according to AsiaHedge, an important tracker of hedge fund trends.

Auto Accident
Many auto accident claims do not settle quickly. Being injured is bad enough, but if you’re unable to work, life becomes that much harder. As bills pile up, people often feel pressure to settle their cases early for less than the fair value. An Oasis Financial cash lifeline gives you and your attorney breathing room, so you’re not forced to take the defendant’s first offer. 




Workers Comp
Almost half of all work place injuries are serious enough to cause the employee to miss work or require ongoing medical care. Worker’s Compensation laws were created to protect injured workers by providing for medical care, compensation for lost wages related to the injury and rehabilitation and/or retraining if necessary. 

Because paying these claims can be costly, employers don’t always believe they are legitimate, creating undue delays in resolving them. In addition, defendants often don’t even make an initial offer. They want to pay zero—more reason than ever to give your attorney time to win a fair settlement.*

 
*Oasis does not work with Workers Compensation cases in Alaska, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, or Wyoming.




Civil Rights
These claims can result from a wide variety of discriminatory misconduct, including misconduct regarding age, disability, pregnancy, race and religious discrimination—as well as different types of harassment charges. While the actions prompting these claims may not leave a person with a physical injury, they can cause significant stress for the claimant and their family—negatively impacting the family’s financial situation. Civil rights cases often take years to settle.




Construction Negligence
The reality of construction litigation is that even with an experienced lawyer and a well-documented case, the legal process can move slowly. Defendants aren’t likely to step up and provide a quick resolution with a fair award. More commonly, the defendant will offer a small amount, hoping the claimant is financially needy enough to take it.




FELA (Railroad)
Similar to Workers Comp, the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA) provides compensation for railroad workers injured on the job. Almost any worker employed by a railroad company, even those whose primary responsibilities are not performed in or around trains, is protected under the FELA. 

The degree of negligence the plaintiff must show under the FELA (usually due to the railroad, its employees or an equipment manufacturer) is actually less than “no fault” Workers Comp. However, FELA requires a higher burden of proof by the courts than Workers Comp, so FELA litigation can last much longer.




General Negligence 
Negligence lawsuits cover a broad range of specific complaints including: animal bites, amusement park injuries, bicycle and pedestrian accidents, plus homeowner and nursing home negligence. Since these cases are expensive and time-consuming to defend, the defendant will probably want to settle quickly, but that rarely means the amount offered will be fair.




Jones Act (Maritime)
Like FELA described above, the Jones Act was signed into law to protect maritime workers involved in accidents while at work. As you would expect, claimants must prove that their employers were negligent or “at fault.” 

However, “comparative fault” is involved here. if the employer can prove that the plaintiff’s actions contributed to or caused the accident, the amount of the award can be reduced accordingly. This clause is why nearly all employers will immediately blame plaintiffs for their own accidents—and why these cases can take so long to settle.




Motor Vehicle and  Passenger Injury
See Auto Accident




Pedestrian Injury
Did you know that, on average, a pedestrian is injured every seven minutes?** Collisions with motor vehicle or bicycles, or injuries due to unsafe conditions, can happen anytime. If you’ve sustained injuries through another party’s negligence, you may already know that the legal process moves slowly, even with a strong case.
 
**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2012, Pedestrian Safety, “How big is the problem.”





Premises Negligence  (Slip and Fall)
If you were injured on another’s property and the property owner failed to warn you of the possible hazard, the owner may be found negligent and liable. Premise liability lawsuits encompass a wide range of accidents, but “slip and fall” cases are the most common. 

This type of injury can occur on private or public property and can be caused by uneven or cracked sidewalks, poorly lit pathways, slippery or unbalanced floors, potholes, ripped carpet or rugs, and even bad weather.




Workplace Negligence
A job-related injury is typically covered by Workers Comp insurance. However, if the injury involved negligence on the part of the employer, a fellow employee or a product, tool or machine produced by a third party, a workplace negligence lawsuit may be filed. These are often handled outside of the state-specific Workers Comp “no-fault” claims process.

Since these cases are not considered “no fault,” it is the claimant’s burden to prove that the other party is liable. This can lead to a long, contentious fight.




Wrongful Death
There are no words to describe the loss of a loved one, especially due to a senseless accident caused by the actions or negligence of someone else. In addition to taking a terrible emotional toll on those left behind, the wrongful death of a loved one can also create significant financial hardships.













 If you lose, you don’t have to pay us back.
 Our share of the case's potential proceeds varies according to several factors. Pay nothing out of pocket—payment comes out of the award or settlement amount. Owe nothing if you don't win your case. 













  How to Qualify Checklist Say “yes” to the 2 statements below and you’ve met the initial requirements. Final approval is subject to our underwriting standards. We tend to fund 5-10% of the value of your claim (this is part part of the approval process).
