Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat

How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
