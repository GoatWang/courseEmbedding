What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

These companies spent over $1 billion buying back shares while their CEOs were dumping them

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar spins wheels ahead of GDP report expected to show faster clip of growth
              
              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.

Vanguard bond funds


94% of our low-cost bond funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Find income and stability with bond funds
Get higher potential for income



Bond mutual funds give your portfolio the opportunity to earn income, unlike money market funds (which focus on protecting your cash) and stock funds (which aim for long-term growth).

Add stability to your portfolio



When included in a well-balanced portfolio, bond funds can help balance the risks associated with stock funds.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds in a single fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds.

Get broad exposure to the bond markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the bond portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of bonds in a single, diversified fund.






Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund holds more than 5,000 domestic investment-grade bonds.

Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund holds about 3,000 non-U.S. bonds.

How to choose a bond fund



There are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right bond fund for your portfolio:

Am I investing outside of an IRA or other retirement account?



If you're in one of the highest tax brackets and investing outside of your retirement account, you may be able to reduce your tax exposure with a tax-exempt bond fund.
Find out if tax-exempt mutual funds are right for you
Cut your federal tax bill with a national tax-exempt fund. Get added state-tax savings if you live in:

				California

				Massachusetts

				New Jersey

				New York

				Ohio

				Pennsylvania


See a list of Vanguard tax-exempt bond funds


Do I want domestic or international bonds?



Investing in both U.S. and international bond funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

How much risk am I comfortable with?



Knowing the general traits used to identify the different bonds within a bond fund can help you determine your overall tolerance for risk.

Average maturity. Bond funds come with short-, intermediate-, or long-term maturities. The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the fund is to changes in interest rates.

Credit quality. Bonds that are backed by the government or one of its agencies have the best "creditworthiness" and a lower chance of default than most corporate bonds. Corporate bonds with high credit quality are considered investment-grade bonds, and those below investment-grade are considered high-yield ("junk") bonds.



Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While this gives you the chance to beat the benchmark, any actively managed fund could just as easily miss the mark.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Do I want to keep pace with inflation?



Inflation-protected bond funds invest in government bonds and are routinely adjusted for inflation.

	Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates, and credit risk, which is the chance a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Notes & Disclosures
 For share classes offered after the fund's inception date, the total returns quoted reflect the performance of the fund's initial share class(es), adjusted to reflect applicable non-recurring sales charges. Performance for these share classes has not been adjusted to reflect any class-specific distribution or servicing fees or any differences in operating expenses. Had such fees and expenses been reflected, returns for these share class returns during such periods would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return, yield, and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Source: Morningstar, Inc.
