Starter Years[edit]
Arthur Ryan was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on Long Island. He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School. He went on to attend Providence College in 1963, where he received his BA[2] in mathematics. During college, Ryan sold magazines to earn extra money; this was Ryan's first sales experience job.[3] Ryan also served in the U.S. Army and was stationed outside of Washington D.C. While being in D.C., Ryan decided to take extra classes at American University. In 1965, Ryan was discharged from the Army and went to work as a computer system designer at Control Data Corporation.
Early career[edit]
From 1972 to December 1994, Ryan worked with Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1976, Ryan became head of the entire securities processing business for Chase. In 1978, Ryan hit his big break when Thomas G. Labrecque saw potential in Ryan and gave him the responsibility to oversee the bank's domestic wholesale operations like check processing, wire transfers and securities services.[4] By 1984, Ryan was appointed to an executive vice president for Chase and received a chairman position on the board. In the same year, Labrecque succeeded the former CEO and Ryan realized that his career at Chase hit a plateau.
Prudential Insurance[edit]
At 52 years in old, Ryan was offered CEO and chairman position at Prudential Insurance, a life insurance agency.[5] He was the first outsider to become CEO of the company. He changed the whole system that Prudential operated on and the environment the Prudential grew a reputation for. In the news, Prudential was covered with scandals, so he asked New Jersey to launch a full investigation against the company. New Jersey came up with $35 million in fines and $410 million to $1 billion for victimized policy holders. During this time, Prudential slowly slipped down to 5th in assets. Ryan had no political agenda, he was there solely to create a better company.[6] Ryan also launched a $800 million cost cutting program. He fired hundreds of agents and managers. He improved the technology keeping Prudential competitive. Ryan’s greatest success was bringing the company from a mutual to a stock company (a private company to public). The new company, Prudential Financial, took control of Prudential Insurance’s assets while Ryan remained CEO.
He retired from Prudential in 2008 and now lives in Florida but remains on the Board of biopharmaceutical company Regeneron.
Philanthropy[edit]
[7] Arthur Ryan has been a loyal and generous supporter of his alma mater, Providence College, from which he earned a mathematics degree in 1963. In January 2015, the college announced that the new home of its School of Business will be called The Arthur and Patricia Ryan Center for Business Studies, thanks to a generous naming gift. The Ryan Concert Hall in the college's Smith Center for the Arts already bears the Ryan name, and the Arthur F. Ryan Family Scholarship Fund supports PC business students from Suffolk County, where he grew up. Ryan has also donated back to his high school. He and his wife have always valued the educational system and support it. He is also involved with New Jersey United to help public schools stay on top of the standards and better the community.
Ryan is a trustee of Prudential Foundation and the Board of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital.
Ryan is married to his wife Patricia and has four grown children. He retired from Prudential in 2008 and now lives in Florida. He is the grandfather of seven.

      ■ As the first outsider to be named chief executive officer (CEO)
      and chairman of Prudential Insurance Company of America, Arthur F. Ryan
      took charge at a time of turmoil. He oversaw the conversion of the company
      from a mutual form of ownership, in which policyholders owned the insurer,
      to stock ownership, resulting in the publicly traded Prudential Financial,
      which gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. Although
      regarded as unpretentious and possessing a warm and friendly manner, Ryan
      was also known for his tough management style. While serving as president
      of Chase Manhattan Bank he earned the nickname "the
      gorilla." His technology background (he began in Chase's
      data-processing department) was also seemingly at odds with his
      people-oriented approach to business. Ryan devoted a good deal of time to
      charitable works while at Prudential, as the company donated millions of
      dollars to support the arts and educational activities in its home state
      of New Jersey. Ryan regarded many of these public works as simply good
      business, thereby demonstrating his ability to balance the hard-nosed and
      amiable sides of his personality. If he had not become a chief executive
      at a major corporation, Ryan claimed he would have become a teacher.
    

      BROOKLYN BORN, LONG ISLAND RAISED
    

      Ryan was born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised on Long Island. He
      graduated from Providence College in 1963, earning a BA in mathematics. It
      was during his college
       days that he gained his only sales experience: selling magazines during
      one summer. He then served a two-year stint as a lieutenant in the U.S.
      Army, serving in Washington, D.C., with the Army Security Agency. During
      his time in Washington he furthered his education by taking classes at
      American University. Following his discharge in 1965, Ryan went to work as
      a computer-systems designer for Control Data Corporation and later gained
      managerial experience when he was appointed area manager. He would put
      this combination of experience to use at Chase when he joined the bank in
      1972.
    

      THOMAS LABRECQUE: A CAREER CATALYST
    

      Ryan began his career at Chase as a project manager in the data-processing
      division and soon began ascending the ranks of the institution. In 1975 he
      was put in charge of securities processing, and a year later became head
      of the entire securities processing business. Ryan received a major career
      break in 1978 when a treasury department executive, Thomas G. Labrecque,
      recognized his potential and promoted the relatively obscure Ryan to
      oversee all of the bank's domestic wholesale operations, including
      check processing, wire transfers, and trust and securities services. More
      importantly, Ryan formed a close bond with Labrecque, who in 1980 became a
      surprise choice for president at Chase. Ryan reported directly to
      Labrecque for the rest of his tenure at the bank. The two men formed a
      good team, possessing complimentary abilities. Labrecque was described as
      aloof and "pedigreed," a far cry from the rolled-up-sleeves,
      straight-talking approach of Ryan.
    

      In 1979 Ryan was appointed to the bank's policy and planning
      committee, which was composed of 17 top executives who met on a quarterly
      basis to determine bank policy. In 1982 Labrecque expanded Ryan's
      job, giving him overview responsibilities for all of the bank's
      systems worldwide, including those employed by retail operations. The
      experience he gained on the retail side would be put to good use two years
      later. In 1984 Chase's consumer-banking business was reorganized,
      and Ryan was installed as its head with the title of executive vice
      president, responsible for retail-banking operations around the world. A
      year later he became a vice chairman. For the personable and down-to-earth
      Ryan, the move into the consumer area was a welcome change, allowing him
      to put his own experience as a consumer to good use in determining new
      product lines. "It's always nice to be in a business where
      you're one of them," he told 
      
        American Banker
      
       in a 1990 profile. The consumer bank performed well under his leadership,
      enjoying a compound growth rate of 24 percent over the next four years.
      Ryan gave much of the credit for the operation's success to the
      decision of Labrecque and chairman Willard C. Butcher in the late 1970s to
      aggressively pursue the retail business, at a time "when it
      wasn't a very popular choice to make." Ryan went on to tell 
      
        American Banker
      
      , "I had the opportunity to demonstrate that if we had the
      resources and spent them wisely, we could really do something."
    

      "THE GORILLA"
    

      Labrecque succeeded Butcher as chairman in 1990 and named Ryan as his
      replacement as president and to serve as his second in command. The two
      faced some major challenges. Along with Butcher they had been instrumental
      in taking Chase public in October 1989, offering such a promising picture
      of earnings that Chase was able to raise $625 million rather than the $500
      million envisioned. Investors were not pleased, however, when the bank
      soon developed problems with some real-estate loans and the
      corporate-financing market went soft, resulting in Chase falling short of
      its projections. Labrecque and Ryan responded by ruthlessly slashing
      costs, streamlining the operation by eliminating layers of management, and
      focusing the bank's resources on its strongest businesses. As a
      result, they restored Chase to profitability, and Ryan earned his
      reputation as "the gorilla." He may have been informal and
      warm, but according to one colleague, "At the end of the day, you
      deliver or you are history" (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , August 5, 1996).
    

      Ryan, at 52 years of age, had reached a plateau in his career at Chase.
      With Labrecque only four years older, there appeared little chance that he
      would ever take the next step and become chairman of the bank. Thus, when
      presented with the opportunity to become CEO and chairman at Prudential
      Insurance, Ryan accepted. His appointment marked the first time in the
      insurer's 120-year history that it had turned to an outsider, and
      someone without experience in the industry. But given the difficult
      straits in which Prudential found itself, there was good reason to look
      outside the company, even if the move risked demoralizing the executive
      ranks.
    

      CHALLENGES AT PRUDENTIAL
    

      For decades Prudential had traded on a solid reputation, portraying itself
      as "The Rock." But the mutual company, which came into
      existence to provide industrial insurance to the working class, paying for
      funeral and burial costs, expanded in the 1980s into financial products
      and landed in trouble. By the early 1990s the company was beset by a
      number of scandals as well as other endemic problems. The insurer had to
      admit that its securities unit had sold partnerships fraudulently, a
      mistake that would cost $1.5 billion to correct. Prudential also faced
      scrutiny on its life-insurance-sales practices, leading to a multistate
      regulatory investigation. In addition, the company posted a string of
      disappointing earnings and endured high restructuring costs
      that—along with $1.6 billion in losses from Hurricane Andrew in
      1992 and a drop in the value of its real-estate and bond
      holdings—hurt profitability. Ryan also faced the difficult
      challenge of fundamentally changing a staid corporate culture that could
      in its own way warrant being called "The Rock." 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
       offered one insider's take of the situation in a 1996 article:
      "This has been a company
       where the CEO could make a decision and some guy four layers down could
      derail it" (August 5, 1996).
    

      REBUILDING "THE ROCK"
    

      To address the problems at Prudential, Ryan had to use both the personable
      and the tough sides of his character, as well as rely on his technical
      background. To resolve the company's life-insurance-sales problem,
      Ryan encouraged New Jersey's insurance commissioner to launch an
      investigation, even though Prudential's home state was not one of
      the six looking into allegations that Prudential agents had deceived
      customers into buying new, expensive life-insurance policies as a way to
      pocket commissions without regard for the needs of the policyholders.
      Thus, New Jersey examiners led the multistate probe that resulted in
      Prudential being fined $35 million, the largest fine ever levied against
      an insurer, and agreeing to a settlement package that would pay $410
      million to $1 billion to victimized policyholders. Although on the surface
      the punishment appeared stiff, critics claimed that Ryan had in fact
      engineered a sweetheart deal. Given that Prudential held assets worth $219
      billion, the $35 million fine was not especially significant, and the
      terms of the settlement placed the burden of proof on policyholders to
      show they had been wronged. The day after the settlement was announced,
      Ryan began the process of repairing Prudential's tarnished image,
      taking out full-page newspaper ads to apologize for the company's
      "intolerable" sales practices (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , August 5, 1996). He fired hundreds of agents and managers, restructured
      the sales system, and established strong internal controls.
    

      Ryan took other steps to improve the financials, both for the short- and
      long-term. He launched an $800 million annual cost-savings program and
      sold off more than $1.4 billion in businesses that were not considered
      core to the company's future. As he had done at Chase, Ryan also
      streamlined Prudential's management. Although he placed a great
      deal of emphasis on saving money, Ryan was not averse to making
      investments that would benefit Prudential over the long haul. He may have
      been an out-of-date technologist, but he still recognized the need to
      improve the company's information technology (IT). He spent large
      sums to upgrade Prudential's IT infrastructure, and under his
      leadership the company was in the vanguard of providing laptops, and later
      wireless handheld computers, to sales agents. In 1995 Ryan first began
      discussing the programming problems associated with the change to the year
      2000. According to his chief information officer, Bill Friel, "He
      recognized all the metrics, the code, the function points and understood
      the issues associated with that, and how to plan and manage the
      program" (
      
        Insurance and Technology
      
      , September 1998). As a result, Prudential was able to get started on the
      conversion well before its rivals. Ryan's understanding of the role
      technology could play in business was also evident in the way he
      incorporated IT functions throughout the company to employ technology for
      even greater effect. He also looked to technology to help Prudential deal
      with compliance issues, especially important in light of the sales
      scandals the company had endured in recent years.
    

      A HANDS-ON APPROACH
    

      Just as Ryan was making progress on some fronts, his momentum in turning
      around Prudential would be stunted by fresh problems. The company's
      health-insurance business, for instance, was losing hundreds of millions
      of dollars. Prudential had been one of the pioneers in health care,
      establishing a health-maintenance organization in the early 1970s, but
      with increased competition in the managed-care sector in the 1990s
      Prudential was unable to keep expenses in line with revenues. As a result
      the company underperformed the market, leading to the resignations of the
      division's top two executives. Always the hands-on leader, Ryan
      stepped in to run the division himself until replacements could be hired.
      He ultimately decided Prudential needed to leave the health-care industry,
      aside from providing long-term coverage. Ryan and Prudential also faced
      continued problems with state regulators, dissatisfied with the
      life-insurance settlement. The Florida insurance commissioner, in
      particular, threatened to suspend the company's license to do
      business in Florida.
    

      CHARITY A PRIORITY
    

      From the start of his tenure at Prudential, Ryan attempted to treat the
      insurer as a public company in preparation of one day demutualizing it
      (converting the company from a mutual form of ownership, in which
      policyholders owned the insurer, to stock ownership). Part of that effort
      involved good corporate citizenship and involving Prudential in charitable
      works. For Ryan, whose wife Patricia was a community activist, public work
      was a personal value as well. Much of Prudential's financial
      support was devoted to Newark, New Jersey, where the company was
      headquartered. It spent $6.5 million to have the main concert hall of the
      New Jersey Performing Arts Center named after it, and coendowed a
      foundation that would buy and provide master plans for properties
      surrounding the arts center. Ryan and his wife supplemented the donation
      to the arts center with personal contributions. Prudential also
      established a $1 million challenge grant for the city's public
      schools and donated $200,000 of the $500,000 needed to subsidize the
      fee-based buses that circled downtown Newark in a further effort to
      revitalize the city. In addition, Ryan made a personal commitment to
      educational activities. He served as a trustee to Providence College,
      where he also established the Arthur Ryan Family Scholarship. In New
      Jersey, Ryan agreed to help lead New Jersey United, an organization
      established to improve public education by supporting a standards-based
      educational approach to public schools. Ryan also procured funding
       from Prudential for New Jersey United and donated staff time of two
      Prudential employees.
    

      LEADS PRUDENTIAL'S CONVERSION TO STOCK OWNERSHIP
    

      In the late 1990s Ryan began the formal process of converting Prudential
      from a mutual to a stock company, following on the heels of other mutual
      insurers who had taken the step earlier in the decade. An initial bill
      authorizing the change was passed by the New Jersey legislature in 1998,
      but it was not until 2001 that the process was completed. A new company,
      Prudential Financial, was incorporated and taken public to acquire the
      assets of Prudential Insurance. Ryan retained the CEO post and
      chairmanship of the new stock company, which on December 13, 2001 began
      trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With stock at his disposal Ryan
      was better positioned to move the company forward in a highly competitive
      environment where insurance and financial products were sold by insurers
      and bankers alike. Prudential could now supplement pay packages with stock
      options, an increasingly key element in attracting top-notch executive
      talent. Moreover, Prudential had the capacity to use stock to fuel growth.
      After the conversion, Ryan engineered a number of acquisitions, including
      the purchase of American Skandia, which was the largest distributor of
      variable annuities through independent financial planners in the United
      States. Prudential was able to create a retail-brokerage business with
      Wachovia Corporation. The resulting Wachovia Securities, was one of the
      largest retail financial-advisory organizations in the United States. In
      2004 Prudential paid $2.1 billion for the retirement business of Cigna
      Corporation, making it the largest manager of stable-value and
      funding-agreement assets, serving more than 3.3 million active workers and
      retirees. Prudential also looked overseas, acquiring two South Korean
      asset-management companies. Ryan, who had come to Prudential Insurance
      with no experience in insurance, was now taking Prudential Financial into
      many of the retail-banking areas he had nurtured during his tenure at
      Chase. At the same time, he continued to repair Prudential's
      tarnished image.

Phelan ’66 & ’15Hon., as he rings a bell to symbolize the opening of the business school building.  ​​1/24/2017 - The soft opening of the Arthur & 
Patricia Ryan Center for Business Studies was attended by many.  Fr. 
Brian Shanley, President, Dr. Hugh Lena, Provost and Dr. Sylvia 
Maxfield, Dean of ​​​​School of Business led the event. A formal Grand 
Opening and Dedication ceremony is scheduled for April 29, 2017. 1/17/2017 - It's

its state-of-the-art classrooms, the Ryan Center for Business Studies is
 spectacular.   ​ 12/21/2016 - Hard at work outfitting, classrooms, offices and last minute touches on interior spaces for classes set to begin on January 17, 2017.Complete with site Christmas tree this classroom is finished awaiting final furniture.  Monitors are up in our data labs. With monitors and floor to ceiling white boards these classrooms allow for easy group collaboration. New offices are being outfitted with new furniture.  The atrium shows off the wood accented Dore Hall windows and ceiling panels. – Looking west, the new steel arch is accented by the College’s eternal flame. From different angles the flame has orange, red, and blue hues to mimic that of a real torch. 12/06/2016 - Large lecture hall is taking shape and almost ready for a coat of paint while second floor classroom is the first to be carpeted.​​​​​​​11/22/2016 - Gothic Arch Installed The “gothic arch” installed at the west entrance of the new Arthur and Patricia Ryan School for Business Studies was designed with a couple of different purposes in mind.  The architects at SMMA, while designing the building, were looking for a way to link the traditional  gothic architecture of Harkins Hall with the more contemporary design of what will become the signature building of the newly integrated  east campus.  The Ryan School of Business’ tower at the west entry along with the newly installed gothic arch, continues the design rhythm of Harkins Hall that the architects in 1917 used to inspire the most iconic building on the campus. ​​The arch at the Ryan Center is a free standing 18 foot wide structure standing 30 feet high and weighing approximately 5 tons.  It will serve as the location for the building name​​ which will be installed within the coming week.  The arch outline will be lit with “LED”  lighting concealed in the steel flange facing west.  ​11/03/16 - ​Mill work panels are being ins​talled along the addition's second floor.  The curtain wall for the finance lab and mesa continues.​9/30/2016 - Fr.

8/25/2016 - ​Exciting changes happening on east campus. The glass wall is in place on the back side of the Center for Business Studies.  An outside patio area will also be constructed here, complete with access to take-out window from cafe.  Second floor bridge photos show all the amazing light that will be in the building from the many sky lights.  You can see the rounded portion of the building when looking up from the second floor.  ​8/5/2016 - Standing on second floor bridge looking north you feel dwarfed by the side of the halo skylights.  This space will be flooded with natural light.  Looking south from the bridge, framing of classrooms is coming together.

■ As the first outsider to be named chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of Prudential Insurance Company of America, Arthur F. Ryan took charge at a time of turmoil. He oversaw the conversion of the company from a mutual form of ownership, in which policyholders owned the insurer, to stock ownership, resulting in the publicly traded Prudential Financial, which gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001. Although regarded as unpretentious and possessing a warm and friendly manner, Ryan was also known for his tough management style. While serving as president of Chase Manhattan Bank he earned the nickname "the gorilla." His technology background (he began in Chase's data-processing department) was also seemingly at odds with his people-oriented approach to business. Ryan devoted a good deal of time to charitable works while at Prudential, as the company donated millions of dollars to support the arts and educational activities in its home state of New Jersey. Ryan regarded many of these public works as simply good business, thereby demonstrating his ability to balance the hard-nosed and amiable sides of his personality. If he had not become a chief executive at a major corporation, Ryan claimed he would have become a teacher.
BROOKLYN BORN, LONG ISLAND RAISED


Ryan was born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised on Long Island. He graduated from Providence College in 1963, earning a BA in mathematics. It was during his college days that he gained his only sales experience: selling magazines during one summer. He then served a two-year stint as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, serving in Washington, D.C., with the Army Security Agency. During his time in Washington he furthered his education by taking classes at American University. Following his discharge in 1965, Ryan went to work as a computer-systems designer for Control Data Corporation and later gained managerial experience when he was appointed area manager. He would put this combination of experience to use at Chase when he joined the bank in 1972.
THOMAS LABRECQUE: A CAREER CATALYST
Ryan began his career at Chase as a project manager in the data-processing division and soon began ascending the ranks of the institution. In 1975 he was put in charge of securities processing, and a year later became head of the entire securities processing business. Ryan received a major career break in 1978 when a treasury department executive, Thomas G. Labrecque, recognized his potential and promoted the relatively obscure Ryan to oversee all of the bank's domestic wholesale operations, including check processing, wire transfers, and trust and securities services. More importantly, Ryan formed a close bond with Labrecque, who in 1980 became a surprise choice for president at Chase. Ryan reported directly to Labrecque for the rest of his tenure at the bank. The two men formed a good team, possessing complimentary abilities. Labrecque was described as aloof and "pedigreed," a far cry from the rolled-up-sleeves, straight-talking approach of Ryan.
In 1979 Ryan was appointed to the bank's policy and planning committee, which was composed of 17 top executives who met on a quarterly basis to determine bank policy. In 1982 Labrecque expanded Ryan's job, giving him overview responsibilities for all of the bank's systems worldwide, including those employed by retail operations. The experience he gained on the retail side would be put to good use two years later. In 1984 Chase's consumer-banking business was reorganized, and Ryan was installed as its head with the title of executive vice president, responsible for retail-banking operations around the world. A year later he became a vice chairman. For the personable and down-to-earth Ryan, the move into the consumer area was a welcome change, allowing him to put his own experience as a consumer to good use in determining new product lines. "It's always nice to be in a business where you're one of them," he told American Banker in a 1990 profile. The consumer bank performed well under his leadership, enjoying a compound growth rate of 24 percent over the next four years. Ryan gave much of the credit for the operation's success to the decision of Labrecque and chairman Willard C. Butcher in the late 1970s to aggressively pursue the retail business, at a time "when it wasn't a very popular choice to make." Ryan went on to tell American Banker, "I had the opportunity to demonstrate that if we had the resources and spent them wisely, we could really do something."
"THE GORILLA"
Labrecque succeeded Butcher as chairman in 1990 and named Ryan as his replacement as president and to serve as his second in command. The two faced some major challenges. Along with Butcher they had been instrumental in taking Chase public in October 1989, offering such a promising picture of earnings that Chase was able to raise $625 million rather than the $500 million envisioned. Investors were not pleased, however, when the bank soon developed problems with some real-estate loans and the corporate-financing market went soft, resulting in Chase falling short of its projections. Labrecque and Ryan responded by ruthlessly slashing costs, streamlining the operation by eliminating layers of management, and focusing the bank's resources on its strongest businesses. As a result, they restored Chase to profitability, and Ryan earned his reputation as "the gorilla." He may have been informal and warm, but according to one colleague, "At the end of the day, you deliver or you are history" (BusinessWeek, August 5, 1996).
Ryan, at 52 years of age, had reached a plateau in his career at Chase. With Labrecque only four years older, there appeared little chance that he would ever take the next step and become chairman of the bank. Thus, when presented with the opportunity to become CEO and chairman at Prudential Insurance, Ryan accepted. His appointment marked the first time in the insurer's 120-year history that it had turned to an outsider, and someone without experience in the industry. But given the difficult straits in which Prudential found itself, there was good reason to look outside the company, even if the move risked demoralizing the executive ranks.
CHALLENGES AT PRUDENTIAL
For decades Prudential had traded on a solid reputation, portraying itself as "The Rock." But the mutual company, which came into existence to provide industrial insurance to the working class, paying for funeral and burial costs, expanded in the 1980s into financial products and landed in trouble. By the early 1990s the company was beset by a number of scandals as well as other endemic problems. The insurer had to admit that its securities unit had sold partnerships fraudulently, a mistake that would cost $1.5 billion to correct. Prudential also faced scrutiny on its life-insurance-sales practices, leading to a multistate regulatory investigation. In addition, the company posted a string of disappointing earnings and endured high restructuring costs that—along with $1.6 billion in losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and a drop in the value of its real-estate and bond holdings—hurt profitability. Ryan also faced the difficult challenge of fundamentally changing a staid corporate culture that could in its own way warrant being called "The Rock." BusinessWeek offered one insider's take of the situation in a 1996 article: "This has been a company where the CEO could make a decision and some guy four layers down could derail it" (August 5, 1996).
REBUILDING "THE ROCK"
To address the problems at Prudential, Ryan had to use both the personable and the tough sides of his character, as well as rely on his technical background. To resolve the company's life-insurance-sales problem, Ryan encouraged New Jersey's insurance commissioner to launch an investigation, even though Prudential's home state was not one of the six looking into allegations that Prudential agents had deceived customers into buying new, expensive life-insurance policies as a way to pocket commissions without regard for the needs of the policyholders. Thus, New Jersey examiners led the multistate probe that resulted in Prudential being fined $35 million, the largest fine ever levied against an insurer, and agreeing to a settlement package that would pay $410 million to $1 billion to victimized policyholders. Although on the surface the punishment appeared stiff, critics claimed that Ryan had in fact engineered a sweetheart deal. Given that Prudential held assets worth $219 billion, the $35 million fine was not especially significant, and the terms of the settlement placed the burden of proof on policyholders to show they had been wronged. The day after the settlement was announced, Ryan began the process of repairing Prudential's tarnished image, taking out full-page newspaper ads to apologize for the company's "intolerable" sales practices (BusinessWeek, August 5, 1996). He fired hundreds of agents and managers, restructured the sales system, and established strong internal controls.
Ryan took other steps to improve the financials, both for the short- and long-term. He launched an $800 million annual cost-savings program and sold off more than $1.4 billion in businesses that were not considered core to the company's future. As he had done at Chase, Ryan also streamlined Prudential's management. Although he placed a great deal of emphasis on saving money, Ryan was not averse to making investments that would benefit Prudential over the long haul. He may have been an out-of-date technologist, but he still recognized the need to improve the company's information technology (IT). He spent large sums to upgrade Prudential's IT infrastructure, and under his leadership the company was in the vanguard of providing laptops, and later wireless handheld computers, to sales agents. In 1995 Ryan first began discussing the programming problems associated with the change to the year 2000. According to his chief information officer, Bill Friel, "He recognized all the metrics, the code, the function points and understood the issues associated with that, and how to plan and manage the program" (Insurance and Technology, September 1998). As a result, Prudential was able to get started on the conversion well before its rivals. Ryan's understanding of the role technology could play in business was also evident in the way he incorporated IT functions throughout the company to employ technology for even greater effect. He also looked to technology to help Prudential deal with compliance issues, especially important in light of the sales scandals the company had endured in recent years.
A HANDS-ON APPROACH
Just as Ryan was making progress on some fronts, his momentum in turning around Prudential would be stunted by fresh problems. The company's health-insurance business, for instance, was losing hundreds of millions of dollars. Prudential had been one of the pioneers in health care, establishing a health-maintenance organization in the early 1970s, but with increased competition in the managed-care sector in the 1990s Prudential was unable to keep expenses in line with revenues. As a result the company underperformed the market, leading to the resignations of the division's top two executives. Always the hands-on leader, Ryan stepped in to run the division himself until replacements could be hired. He ultimately decided Prudential needed to leave the health-care industry, aside from providing long-term coverage. Ryan and Prudential also faced continued problems with state regulators, dissatisfied with the life-insurance settlement. The Florida insurance commissioner, in particular, threatened to suspend the company's license to do business in Florida.
CHARITY A PRIORITY


From the start of his tenure at Prudential, Ryan attempted to treat the insurer as a public company in preparation of one day demutualizing it (converting the company from a mutual form of ownership, in which policyholders owned the insurer, to stock ownership). Part of that effort involved good corporate citizenship and involving Prudential in charitable works. For Ryan, whose wife Patricia was a community activist, public work was a personal value as well. Much of Prudential's financial support was devoted to Newark, New Jersey, where the company was headquartered. It spent $6.5 million to have the main concert hall of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center named after it, and coendowed a foundation that would buy and provide master plans for properties surrounding the arts center. Ryan and his wife supplemented the donation to the arts center with personal contributions. Prudential also established a $1 million challenge grant for the city's public schools and donated $200,000 of the $500,000 needed to subsidize the fee-based buses that circled downtown Newark in a further effort to revitalize the city. In addition, Ryan made a personal commitment to educational activities. He served as a trustee to Providence College, where he also established the Arthur Ryan Family Scholarship. In New Jersey, Ryan agreed to help lead New Jersey United, an organization established to improve public education by supporting a standards-based educational approach to public schools. Ryan also procured funding from Prudential for New Jersey United and donated staff time of two Prudential employees.
LEADS PRUDENTIAL'S CONVERSION TO STOCK OWNERSHIP
In the late 1990s Ryan began the formal process of converting Prudential from a mutual to a stock company, following on the heels of other mutual insurers who had taken the step earlier in the decade. An initial bill authorizing the change was passed by the New Jersey legislature in 1998, but it was not until 2001 that the process was completed. A new company, Prudential Financial, was incorporated and taken public to acquire the assets of Prudential Insurance. Ryan retained the CEO post and chairmanship of the new stock company, which on December 13, 2001 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. With stock at his disposal Ryan was better positioned to move the company forward in a highly competitive environment where insurance and financial products were sold by insurers and bankers alike. Prudential could now supplement pay packages with stock options, an increasingly key element in attracting top-notch executive talent. Moreover, Prudential had the capacity to use stock to fuel growth. After the conversion, Ryan engineered a number of acquisitions, including the purchase of American Skandia, which was the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the United States. Prudential was able to create a retail-brokerage business with Wachovia Corporation. The resulting Wachovia Securities, was one of the largest retail financial-advisory organizations in the United States. In 2004 Prudential paid $2.1 billion for the retirement business of Cigna Corporation, making it the largest manager of stable-value and funding-agreement assets, serving more than 3.3 million active workers and retirees. Prudential also looked overseas, acquiring two South Korean asset-management companies. Ryan, who had come to Prudential Insurance with no experience in insurance, was now taking Prudential Financial into many of the retail-banking areas he had nurtured during his tenure at Chase. At the same time, he continued to repair Prudential's tarnished image.
