(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of our results of operations and our present financial condition. The consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contain additional detailed information that should be referred to when reviewing this material. Statements in this discussion may be forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed. See "FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS" preceding Item 1. Business.  OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS  Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. was incorporated in 1993 and, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Golden Road Motor Inn, Inc. ("Golden Road"), owns and operates the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, a hotel/casino facility in Reno, Nevada (the "Atlantis"). Monarch's wholly owned subsidiaries, High Desert Sunshine, Inc. ("High Desert"), Golden East, Inc. ("Golden East") and Golden North, Inc. ("Golden North"), each own separate parcels of land located proximate to the Atlantis.  Monarch's wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Growth Inc. ("Monarch Growth"), formed in 2011, acquired Riviera Black Hawk, Inc., owner of the Riviera Black Hawk Casino on April 26, 2012. Riviera Black Hawk, Inc. was renamed Monarch Casino Black Hawk, Inc. and Riviera Black Hawk Casino was renamed Monarch Casino Black Hawk in October 2013. Monarch Growth also owns a parcel of land in Black Hawk, Colorado contiguous to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk. In addition to owning the Monarch Casino Black Hawk, Monarch Black Hawk, Inc. also wholly owns Chicago Dogs Eatery, Inc. and Monarch Promotional Association, both of which were formed related to extended licensure for extended hours of liquor operation in Black Hawk. The Company has included the results of Monarch Black Hawk, Inc. in its consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.  Our operating assets are the Atlantis and the Monarch Casino Black Hawk. Our business strategy is to maximize revenues, operating income and cash flow primarily through our casino, food and beverage operations and, at the Atlantis, our hotel operations. The Monarch Casino Black Hawk does not have a hotel; however, we are in the process of renovations and construction that will include a hotel. See Item 1, "BUSINESS - THE MONARCH CASINO BLACK HAWK." We focus on delivering exceptional service and value to our guests. Our hands-on management style focuses on customer service and cost efficiencies.  Unless otherwise indicated, "Monarch," "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  OPERATING RESULTS SUMMARY  Our operating results may be affected by, among other things, competitive factors, gaming tax increases, the commencement of new gaming operations, construction at our facilities, general public sentiment regarding travel, overall economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties, as well as those matters discussed in Item 1A. "RISK FACTORS" above.  The following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance:  Atlantis: Our business strategy is to maximize revenues, operating income and cash flow primarily through our casino, food and beverage operations and hotel operations. We continuously upgrade our property. With quality gaming, hotel and dining products, we believe the Atlantis is well positioned to benefit from future macro and local economic growth. Several national businesses have relocated or have announced plans to expand or relocate operations to Northern Nevada. While such economic activity could ultimately drive additional revenue and profit at Atlantis, we are experiencing the more immediate effect of increased labor costs, which, combined with continued aggressive marketing programs by our competitors, have applied upward pressure on Atlantis operating costs.  Table of Contents  Monarch Casino Black Hawk: Since the acquisition of Monarch Casino Black Hawk in April 2012, our focus has been to maximize casino and food and beverage revenues while upgrading the existing facility and laying the groundwork for the major expansion that we plan. There is currently no hotel on the property. In October 2012, we began a project to redesign and upgrade the existing Monarch Casino Black Hawk facility. In September 2013, we opened a new buffet. In August 2015, we completed the redesign and upgrade of the existing Monarch Casino Black Hawk, bringing to the facility's interior the same quality, ambiance and finishes of the ongoing master planned expansion that will transform Monarch Casino Black Hawk into a full-scale casino resort. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we began work on a multi-phased expansion of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk, which we refer to herein as the "Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan." The first phase of the Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan is completed. In November 2016, we opened for guest use our elegant nine-story parking facility with about 1,350 spaces. Construction of a new hotel tower and casino expansion on the site where the old parking structure was sitting is under way. (see CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEVELOPMENT - Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan). Once completed, the Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan will nearly double the casino space and will add a 23-story hotel tower with approximately 500 guest rooms and suites, an upscale spa and pool facility, three additional restaurants (increasing the total to four), additional bars and associated support facilities. We currently expect completion of the entire expansion in the second quarter of 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income totaled $24.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $20.7 million, or $1.19 per diluted share for the same period of 2015, reflecting a 19.0% increase in net income and a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $217.0 million and $202.2 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $14.8 million, or 7.3%. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $38.5 million compared to $32.6 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $6.0 million or 18.4%.  Casino revenues increased 7.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. Casino revenues increased at both the Monarch Casino Black Hawk and at the Atlantis. Atlantis benefited from the region's market strength and the increase in local patrons' visits. Monarch Black Hawk casino revenue increased despite the disruptions related to the property's expansion. Casino operating expenses as a percentage of casino revenue decreased to 41.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared to 42.1% in 2015 due to the effect of higher casino revenues partially offset by higher complimentary expense.  Food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased 6.7% over the same period in 2015, due to a 6.4% increase in average revenue per cover. Covers served were flat. Food and beverage operating expenses as a percentage of food and beverage revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were 40.9% compared to 39.4% over the same period in 2015. The increase in expense margin is due primarily to the costs, related to the redesign and upgrade of Toucan Charlie's Buffet at Atlantis, which costs were expensed during the first quarter of 2016.  Hotel revenues increased 3.3% due to a higher ADR of $79.52 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $76.92 for the same period in 2015, partially offset by slightly lower hotel occupancy of 88.2% in 2016 compared to 89.7% in 2015. REVPAR was $77.50 and $75.24 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Hotel operating expenses as a percent of hotel revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was 30.9% compared to 30.0% for the same period in 2015. The increase is due primarily to higher payroll and related benefits expense and expense related to the implementation of advanced analytical tools.  Other revenues increased 3.9% in 2016 compared to 2015 driven primarily by increased Atlantis arcade revenue, Atlantis spa and salon revenue and retail revenue.  Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross revenues declined to 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 18.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to higher revenues and more efficient utilization of complimentaries.  Table of Contents  Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A Expense") expense increased to $57.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 from $54.8 million in the same period of 2015 primarily due to: i) $1.8 million increase in salaries, wages and related benefits expense; ii) $0.7 million increase in marketing expense; iii) $0.5 million increase in rental expense from the parking lot lease at Atlantis (see Note 12. Related Party Transactions); iv) $0.2 million increase in property tax expense, resulting from the new parking structure at Monarch Casino Black Hawk and the addition of the leased parking lot at Atlantis; and v) $0.2 million increase in legal fees expense, all offset by a decrease in utility expense by $0.5 million.  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $15.9 million for the same period in 2015 as a result of: i) a $1.1 million decrease in depreciation expense on the parking structure at Monarch Casino Black Hawk; ii) a $0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense at Atlantis due to assets having become fully depreciated, all partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense from new assets related to the remodel and upgrade project at Monarch Casino Black Hawk.  In 2016, the Company incurred a $677 thousand loss from disposal of assets, primarily as a result of the write off of the remaining net book value of the hotel towers doors at the Atlantis, that were replaced with new doors in the second quarter on 2016.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company paid down the principal balance on its Credit Facility by $14.7 million, which decreased the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility to $26.2 million at December 31, 2016 from $40.9 million at December 31, 2015. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased to $0.6 million in 2016 from $0.7 million in 2015 primarily as a result of lower borrowings in 2016 compared to 2015, offset by an increase in commitment fees in relation to the Amended Credit Facility we entered into in July 2016. See further discussion of our Credit Facility in the LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES section below.  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014  For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net income totaled $20.7 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.2 million, or $0.83 per diluted share for the same period of 2014, reflecting a 45.6% increase in net income and a 43.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $202.2 million and $187.8 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $14.5 million, or 7.7%. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $32.5 million compared to $22.2 million for the same period in 2014, representing an increase of $10.3 million or 46.5%.  Casino revenues increased 8.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. Casino revenues increased at both the Monarch Casino Black Hawk and at the Atlantis. The increase in Monarch Casino Black Hawk revenues was primarily due to the completion of the casino floor upgrade and remodel which attracted more gaming customers. The increase in casino revenues at the Atlantis was driven primarily by the increased local patrons' visitation. Casino operating expenses as a percentage of casino revenue decreased to 42.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, compared to 42.4% in 2014 due to the effect of higher casino revenues partially offset by higher casino expense.  Food and beverage revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased 8.1% over the same period in 2014 due to a 5.4% increase in average revenue per cover, combined with a 2.5% increase in total covers served. Food and beverage operating expenses as a percentage of food and beverage revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were 39.4% compared to 40.9% over the same period in 2014 due primarily to an increase in revenues related to menu price increases in anticipation of commodity price increases.  Hotel revenues increased 4.1% due to higher ADR of $76.92 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $73.66 for the same period in 2014 and slightly higher hotel occupancy of 89.7% in 2015 compared to 89.1% in 2014. REVPAR was $75.24 and $72.26 for years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Hotel operating expenses as a percent of hotel revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 30.0% compared to 27.6% for the same period in 2014. The increase is due primarily to higher payroll and related benefits expense, operating supplies expense and repair and maintenance expense.  Table of Contents  Other revenues increased 7.7% in 2015 compared to 2014 driven primarily by increased Atlantis arcade revenue, Atlantis spa and salon revenue and commission revenue.  Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross revenues was flat at 18.2% for both years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  SG&A expense increased to $54.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 from $53.0 million in the same period of 2014 primarily due to: i) higher salaries, wages and related benefits expenses by $0.9 million; ii) higher repair and maintenance expense by $0.6 million; iii) higher software maintenance expense by $0.4 million; and iv) higher bad debt expense by $0.2 million, all offset by a decrease in sales and marketing expense.  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $17.8 million for the same period in 2014 as a result of: i) lower depreciation expense on the parking structure at the Monarch Casino Black Hawk by $1.2 million; ii) lower depreciation expense at Atlantis by $1.1 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated, all partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense from new assets related to the remodel and upgrade project at the Monarch Casino Black Hawk.  The Company incurred $9 thousand and $343 thousand net loss on disposal of slot machines and other equipment in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2014, the Company incurred $1.9 million of expense related to the campaign against the proposed 2014 ballot initiatives to expand gaming in Colorado. The Company had no such expense in 2015.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company paid down the principal balance on its Credit Facility by $5.4 million, which decreased the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility to $40.9 million at December 31, 2015 from $46.3 million at December 31, 2014. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased to $0.7 million for the year 2015 from $1.1 million for the year 2014 primarily as a result of a lower interest rate driven by our lower leverage ratio combined with lower average outstanding borrowings in 2015 compared to 2014.  CAPITAL SPENDING AND DEVELOPMENT  We seek to continuously upgrade and maintain our facilities in order to present a fresh, high quality product to our guests. Capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):  Capital Expenditures: 2016 2015 Atlantis $ 7,894 $ 7,382 Monarch Casino Black Hawk 17,029 30,677 $ 24,923 $ 38,059  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, capital expenditures related primarily to the redesign and upgrade of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk property and work on the new parking structure, as well as acquisition of gaming equipment to upgrade and replace existing equipment at the Monarch Casino Black Hawk and the Atlantis.  Since the acquisition of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk, we have upgraded the property's food and beverage operations (including an all-new buffet) and completed the redesign and upgrade of the existing casino floor. Our plans also call for the exterior of the existing facility to be refinished to match the master planned expansion. The exterior refinishing is expected to cost approximately $14-$16 million and is anticipated to be funded primarily from operating cash flow or the Amended Credit Facility.  Table of Contents  Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan  The Company has commenced its Monarch Black Hawk Expansion Plan, which will convert the Monarch Casino Black Hawk into a full-scale casino resort.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, we began work on a multi-phased expansion of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk which involves construction of a new parking structure, demolition of the existing parking structure followed by the construction of a new hotel tower and casino expansion. In November 2016, the new nine-story parking structure, offering approximately 1,350 parking spaces, was completed and became available for use by Monarch Casino Black Hawk guests. Immediately following the new garage opening, we began work on demolition and removal of the old parking structure. This work, which included a controlled implosion of the old garage, was completed in the first quarter of 2017.  On February 8, 2017 the Company broke ground on the hotel tower and casino expansion. The new 23-story tower will nearly double the existing casino space and will include approximately 500 hotel rooms, an upscale spa and pool facility, three additional restaurants and additional bars. Tower floors will be opened as they are finished beginning with the casino expansion and additional restaurants. We currently expect completion of the entire tower in the second quarter of 2019 at a total cost of approximately $229-$234 million. The cost is expected to be financed through a combination of operating cash flow and the Amended Credit Facility. We can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on schedule, if at all, or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and, for capital expansion projects, borrowings available under our credit facilities.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $43.7 million, an increase of approximately $5.5 million, or 14.3%, compared to the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of an increase of $3.9 million in net income and an increase in loss on disposal of assets by $0.7 million, combined with changes in ordinary working capital accounts, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $24.9 million and $38.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used for the garage structure at Monarch Casino Black Hawk, the redesign and upgrade of the Toucan Charlie's Buffet at Atlantis and for the acquisition of gaming equipment at both properties. Net cash used in investing activities during 2015 consisted primarily of net cash used for the redesign and upgrade of the Monarch Casino Black Hawk, work on the garage foundation and for the acquisition of gaming equipment and general upgrades at the Atlantis property.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities of $13.6 million resulted from $14.7 million in payments made on our credit facility and $2.6 million in deferred loan cost related to the Amended Credit Facility, partially offset by $3.7 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities of $0.6 million represented $5.4 million in payments made on our credit facility, partially offset by $4.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related tax benefits.  On July 20, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement (the "Amended Credit Facility"), under which our former $100 million credit facility (which as of June 30, 2016 had borrowing capacity reduced to $45.5 million as a result of $19.5 million in mandatory reductions pursuant to the agreement and $35 million in voluntary reductions, as allowed by the agreement) was increased to $250.0 million, and the maturity date was extended from November 15, 2016 to July 20, 2021.  As of December 31, 2016, we had $26.2 million borrowed and $223.8 million remaining in available borrowings of the $250.0 million maximum principal available under the Amended Credit Facility.  Table of Contents  The total revolving loan commitment under the Amended Credit Facility will be automatically and permanently reduced to $50 million in the first full quarter after completion of the expansion project at the Monarch Casino Black Hawk and all then outstanding revolving loans up to $200 million under the Amended Credit Facility will be converted to a term loan at such time. We may be required to prepay borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility using excess cash flows depending on our leverage ratio no later than December 31, 2019. We have an option to permanently reduce the maximum revolving available credit at any time so long as the amount of such reduction is at least $0.5 million and in multiples of $50,000.  Borrowings are secured by liens on substantially all of our real and personal property.  In addition to other customary covenants for a facility of this nature, as of December 31, 2016, we are required to maintain a leverage ratio, defined as consolidated debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA, of no more than 3.5:1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges, as defined) of at least 1.15:1. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratios were 0.5:1 and 47.1:1, respectively.  The interest rate under the Amended Credit Facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.50%, or a base rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.50%, or the Prime Rate. The applicable margins will vary depending on our leverage ratio. Commitment fees are equal to the daily average unused revolving commitment multiplied by the commitment fee percentage, ranging from 0.175% to 0.45%, based on our leverage ratio.  At December 31, 2016, our interest rate was based on LIBOR and our leverage ratio was such that pricing for borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.00%. At December 31, 2016, the one-month LIBOR interest rate was 0.77%. The carrying value of the debt outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility approximates fair value because the interest fluctuates with the lender's prime rate or other market rates of interest.  We may prepay borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility without penalty (subject to certain charges applicable to the prepayment of LIBOR borrowings prior to the end of the applicable interest period). Amounts prepaid may be re-borrowed so long as the total borrowings outstanding do not exceed the maximum principal available.  We believe that our existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the Amended Credit Facility will provide us with sufficient resources to fund our operations, meet our debt obligations, and fulfill our capital expenditure plans over the next twelve months; however, our operations are subject to financial, economic, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or if our cash needs exceed our borrowing capacity under the Amended Credit Facility, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing, delaying or eliminating planned capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  The shopping center adjacent to the Atlantis (the "Shopping Center") is owned by Biggest Little Investments, L.P. ("BLI"). John Farahi and Bob Farahi, Co-Chairmen of the Board and executive officers of the Company, and Ben Farahi are the three largest stockholders (the "Farahi Family Stockholders") of Monarch and each also beneficially owns limited partnership interests in BLI. Maxum LLC is the sole general partner of BLI, and Ben Farahi is the sole managing member of Maxum LLC. Neither John Farahi nor Bob Farahi has any management or operational control over BLI or the Shopping Center. Until May 2006, Ben Farahi held the positions of Co-Chairman of the Board, Secretary, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.  Table of Contents  In response to customer demand for more convenient surface parking at the Atlantis, and after detailed analysis, on August 28, 2015, the Company, through its subsidiary Golden Road, entered into a 20-year lease (the "Parking Lot Lease") with BLI with respect to a portion of the Shopping Center. This lease gives the Atlantis the right to use a parcel, approximately 4.15 acres, comprised of a commercial building and surrounding land adjacent to the Atlantis (the "Leased Property"). The primary purpose of the Parking Lot Lease is to provide additional, convenient, Atlantis surface parking. We demolished the commercial building on the Leased Property and converted the land into approximately 300 additional surface parking spaces for the Atlantis. The minimum annual rent under the Parking Lot Lease is $695 thousand commencing November 17, 2015. The minimum annual rent is subject to a cost of living adjustment increase on each five year anniversary. In addition, we are responsible for payment of property taxes, utilities and maintenance expenses related to the Leased Property. We have an option to renew the Parking Lot Lease for an additional 10-year term. If we elect not to exercise our renewal option, we will be obligated to pay BLI $1.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company paid approximately $695 thousand and $85 thousand in parking lot rent, respectively.  A driveway (the "Driveway Project") that is being shared between the Atlantis and the Shopping Center was completed and opened on September 30, 2004. The Shopping Center is controlled by BLI. As part of the Driveway Project, in January 2004, we leased (the "Driveway Lease") approximately 37,400 square-foot corner section of the Shopping Center, for a minimum lease term of 15 years at . . .

Top Hotel Deals





































Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.


Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel DealsYou may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:
That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science. 
Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time: 
Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples.  Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts.  Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site.  Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% through their "Name Your Own Price" program. Priceline's "Name Your Own Price" reservation system is different from most other online travel sites.

Over the last year, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have yielded savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates for the same itinerary on other leading online travel sites. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates, or prices will be available, and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are subject to change.

                    Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!                

                    You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms on sites such as Hotels.com, Hilton Hotels, and Travelocity, among countless others. But what does... Read More






 




Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms on sites such as Hotels.com, Hilton Hotels, and Travelocity, among countless others. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. 
Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:
The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.
But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises.
For example:  
Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it. 
So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips: 

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination. 
Keep in mind seasonality. 
Search, and search often.

Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.
