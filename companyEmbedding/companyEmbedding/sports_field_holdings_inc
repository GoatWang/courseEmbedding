Sports Field Holdings, Inc. Awarded New Crimson High School Athletic Field In St. George, Utah






GlobeNewswire



Jul 5, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































 WARRENVILLE, Ill., July 05, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sports Field Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Sports Field") (OTCQB:SFHI), through its wholly owned subsidiary FIRSTFORM®, Inc. ("FirstForm"), announced today it was awarded a contract to construct the first athletic field to be installed at the new Crimson High School in St. George, Utah. The new Crimson High School is part of the Washington County School District, the largest school district in St George, Utah. The Company's Direct of Sales Kort Wickenheiser commented, "We are excited to see such a rapid impact from the newest member of our sales team, Jay Schroeder." The former quarterback for the Washington Redskins and the LA Raiders has become a strong advocate for the Company's advanced turf field system, a technology that did not exist when he played in the NFL. The new field represents $864,892.00 in sales to the Company. Sports Field's CEO Jeromy Olson was quoted as saying, "The project at Crimson High School highlights our continued expansion throughout the nation. The opportunity in Utah is a milestone for our Company as we move across the Mississippi and into the western region of the United States. We believe this field will offer a safer, better performing, cooler and more durable surface for the athletes at Crimson High school. This is a great project for our Company; we look forward to working closely with Washington County School District and the faculty of Crimson High School."   About Sports Field Holdings, Inc.  Sports Field Holdings, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary FIRSTFORM, Inc., is a product development, engineering and design-build construction company, engaged in the design, engineering, constructing, and construction management of athletic facilities, and sports complexes. Construction management of sports facilities and synthetic turf sales are the two primary lines of business. These lines of business can be categorized as design, development, and manufacturing of sports surfacing products and associated pre-engineered construction systems.
