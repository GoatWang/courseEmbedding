Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.
