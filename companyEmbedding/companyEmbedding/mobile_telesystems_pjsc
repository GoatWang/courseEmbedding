*MTS launches updated MTS Money Wallet app *

MTS today reintroduced its MTS Money Wallet app to the market, which brings new functionality to offer its users a suite of financial services, all from one app.

From originally offering limited payment and money transfer functionality, MTS Money Wallet has significantly expanded its service offering to become a fully integrated financial platform. The updated version offers users the following:

- *Expanded payment services: *users can make payments from their e-wallet account, mobile account balances, a bank card issued by any Russian banks or a prepaid NFC bank card (the last option currently works only with MTS Bank and for Android users). Limits for single transactions are now comparable to those on traditional bank cards.

- *Higher availability: *both individual and corporate users can now use MTS Money Wallet. It is also available for non-MTS subscribers.

- *Contactless payments: *by creating a virtual MTS Bank card (so far available only with MTS Bank and for Android users), users can now use the app to make contactless payments at POS terminals

- *Online shopping:* customers can pay for their goods online using MTS Money Wallet's one-click functionality

- *Investment services:* users can buy and sell mutual funds through the app

- *Increased synchronization with MTS Bank:* more seamless integration, including the ability to apply for other MTS Bank services such as credit cards through the app

- *Expanded merchant base:* payments can now be made with a broader range of merchants

MTS is continuously developing the MTS Money Wallet app to offer more functions. As this service develops further, users will be able to make payments on messenger apps, tie up their wallet account to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and buy other investment products, including shares and bonds. From July 2017, the service will also open up to feature phone users, which will allow them to access the MTS Money Wallet services through USSD commands. At present, 45% of MTS' subscribers use feature phones, meaning the launch of USSD functionality will significantly expand the e-wallet customer base. MTS will continue to integrate the MTS Bank mobile app features inside its e-wallet.

By the end of 2017, payment terminals of different merchants in Russia - including shops, restaurants, taxi services and online stores - will be accepting 'MTS Money Wallet as one of payment system as well as they accept Visa, MasterCard, MIR cards. MTS Money Wallet users will be able to earn loyalty points and access exclusive offers from the Company's partners, since every user is automatically enrolled onto the MTS Bonus program.

MTS Money Wallet was originally launched in August 2016 as the MTS Money app. Approximately 35 million of MTS' subscribers currently use the operator's financial services, and six million of them are active mobile commerce users. The penetration number has been growing by 25% each year since 2014, creating significant growth potential for the penetration of MTS Money Wallet.

Financial Analysis
MOBILE TELESYSTEMS PJSC's gross profit margin for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017 is essentially unchanged when compared to the same period a year ago. The company managed to grow both sales and net income at a faster pace than the average competitor in its industry this quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago. MOBILE TELESYSTEMS PJSC  has weak liquidity. Currently, the Quick Ratio is 0.87 which shows a lack of ability to cover short-term cash needs. The company's liquidity has decreased from the same period last year. At the same time, stockholders' equity ("net worth") has remained virtually unchanged only increasing by 1.92% from the same quarter last year. Overall, the key liquidity measurements indicate that the company is in a position in which financial difficulties could develop in the future. STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12-months. To learn more visit www.TheStreetRatings.com.

Mobile TeleSystems PJSC: MTS launches updated MTS Money Wallet appHomeMailNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityStyleMoviesWeatherAnswersFlickrMobileYahooSearchSearchMobile TeleSystems PJSC: MTS launches updated MTS Money Wallet appEQS GroupMay 30, 2017ReblogShareTweetShare  EquityStory.RS, LLC-News: Mobile TeleSystems PJSC / Key word(s): Miscellaneous/Product Launch  30.05.2017 / 20:00  The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.    MTS launches updated MTS Money Wallet app  MTS today reintroduced its MTS Money Wallet app to the market, which brings new functionality to offer its users a suite of financial services, all from one app. From originally offering limited payment and money transfer functionality, MTS Money Wallet has significantly expanded its service offering to become a fully integrated financial platform. The updated version offers users the following: - Expanded payment services: users can make payments from their e-wallet account, mobile account balances, a bank card issued by any Russian banks or a prepaid NFC bank card (the last option currently works only with MTS Bank and for Android users). Limits for single transactions are now comparable to those on traditional bank cards. - Higher availability: both individual and corporate users can now use MTS Money Wallet. It is also available for non-MTS subscribers. - Contactless payments: by creating a virtual MTS Bank card (so far available only with MTS Bank and for Android users), users can now use the app to make contactless payments at POS terminals - Online shopping: customers can pay for their goods online using MTS Money Wallet's one-click functionality - Investment services: users can buy and sell mutual funds through the app - Increased synchronization with MTS Bank: more seamless integration, including the ability to apply for other MTS Bank services such as credit cards through the app - Expanded merchant base: payments can now be made with a broader range of merchants MTS is continuously developing the MTS Money Wallet app to offer more functions. As this service develops further, users will be able to make payments on messenger apps, tie up their wallet account to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and buy other investment products, including shares and bonds. From July 2017, the service will also open up to feature phone users, which will allow them to access the MTS Money Wallet services through USSD commands. At present, 45% of MTS' subscribers use feature phones, meaning the launch of USSD functionality will significantly expand the e-wallet customer base. MTS will continue to integrate the MTS Bank mobile app features inside its e-wallet. By the end of 2017, payment terminals of different merchants in Russia - including shops, restaurants, taxi services and online stores - will be accepting 'MTS Money Wallet as one of payment system as well as they accept Visa, MasterCard, MIR cards. MTS Money Wallet users will be able to earn loyalty points and access exclusive offers from the Company's partners, since every user is automatically enrolled onto the MTS Bonus program. MTS Money Wallet was originally launched in August 2016 as the MTS Money app. Approximately 35 million of MTS' subscribers currently use the operator's financial services, and six million of them are active mobile commerce users. The penetration number has been growing by 25% each year since 2014, creating significant growth potential for the penetration of MTS Money Wallet.
