HOMEAbout Our Firm:WelcomeA Note to our EmployeesStaff Directory


About Our FirmAdvisors Management Group, Inc. was organized in 1988 as a Registered Investment Advisory firm. Our firm also provides financial planning, accounting, tax planning, and tax preparation for individuals and small businesses. The collaboration between these services provides maximum performance for our clients' personal and business assets. Our professional staff collaboratively serves clients nationwide through several offices in Wisconsin, including La Crosse, Eau Claire, Green Bay, and Fond du Lac.
Our firm follows disciplined strategies based on the scientific foundation of Value Investing developed by Benjamin Graham in the 1930s and Modern Portfolio Theory developed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s. William Sharpe later expanded Modern Portfolio Theory and in 1990 Markowitz and Sharpe, its creators, won the Nobel Prize in Economic Science. Modern Portfolio Theory is based on strategic diversification of investments across several different asset classes. Appropriate diversification among asset classes and market sectors provides investors with more consistent returns over time.
At AMG we believe in the concept of creating shared value, where the policies and operating practices that enhance a company's operations, simultaneously works towards advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Our shared value approach focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress. This concept rests on the premise that both economic and social progress must be addressed using value principles. These principles are achieved by empowering our customers and employees. Where being successful is measured by the value that is brought to a customer is balanced by the value brought to our employees, and together, the value we deliver to our communities.

The Fiduciary ExperienceWhat is the Fiduciary Standard of Care?
As fiduciaries, it is our legal obligation to act in your best interest at all times, not only at the onset of our relationship. A fiduciary must always serve the best interest of clients, beneficiaries, and retirement plan participants. This is the best and only way to serve you.
Our Fiduciary Commitment to You

We will serve your best interest first and always, without exception
We will maintain complete transparency
We will always avoid conflicts of interest
We will act with prudence, skill, care, diligence, and good judgment
You will be contacted regularly for portfolio reviews
We will provide full and fair disclosure of all important information

Click HERE to view AMG’s signed Fiduciary Questionnaire
What Fee-Only Means to You

We will never accept commissions or compensation of any kind based on where your money is held or which particular investments you hold
The only compensation AMG receives is directly from our clients, avoiding conflicts of interest
Because we are paid along the way to take care of your assets, portfolios are actively managed and adjusted to meet your specific needs and based on the current economic and market conditions 
We will use due diligence to ensure that unnecessary portfolio costs are always avoided

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
