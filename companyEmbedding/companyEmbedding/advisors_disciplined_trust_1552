Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Recovery of Bond Unit Investment Trust Losses




(Last Updated On: July 17, 2015)The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling municipal bond unit investment trust investments.
Unit investment trusts are formed when a trust sponsor puts together a portfolio of securities and then offers share units of the trust through brokers and investment houses. The UIT portfolio holds the initial securities until the termination date of the trust.  Typically, a UIT will have a termination date (a date when the UIT will terminate and dissolve) that is established when the UIT is created (although some may terminate more than fifty years after they are created).  The basic rules of UITs are governed by 15 USC § 80a–26.
A UIT does not actively trade its investment portfolio. That is, a UIT buys a relatively fixed portfolio of securities (for example, five, ten, or twenty specific stocks or bonds), and holds them with little or no change for the life of the UIT.  This can be risky if the market moves against the portfolio.  Unlike a more actively managed investment, like a mutual fund, a UIT portfolio that is not well positioned for the current market climate can be poised for substantial losses.
This is exactly the current risk of long duration bond UITs and municipal bond unit investment trusts.
A bond unit trust is an investment in a fixed, diversified group of professionally selected municipal or corporate bonds. As a unit-holder of a bond unit trust, you own a portion of every bond held in the trust.  If the portfolio is comprised primarily of long duration bonds, when interest rates rise (as they are right now), the underlying value of the bonds will decrease substantially.
Unit investment trusts are strictly broker sold products and there is not an active secondary market for the units. The low visibility of UIT returns makes the rating of unit investment trusts difficult.   Additionally, UITs one of the highest commission products sold by a financial advisor (often explaining the broker’s motivation in selling a UIT as opposed to a basket of municipal or corporate bonds.
UITs are also high cost investments, saddled with hefty transaction fees incurred both when the unit is first purchased and again when the unit dissolves.  Investors are often charged initial sales charges, deferred sales charges, creation and development fees and organization cost fees.
Financial advisors have three basic responsibilities to their clients – to disclose the risks, features of any investment, to perform adequate due diligence on any investment that they recommend, and to only recommend investments that are appropriate for the client in light of that client’s age, investment experience, risk tolerance, and net worth.
Before recommending a bond unit investment trust investment, a financial advisor, at minimum, is required to disclose: (1) the UITs current price, (2) the commissions or markups that must be paid to acquire the UIT, (3) the current yield, the yield to maturity, and the yield to call the bonds being help in the trust, (4) the amount and timing of the bond payments, and, most importantly, (5) the risk of default or devaluation of the particular bonds held in the trust.
In today’s interest rate climate, a financial advisor must also make the investor fully aware of the UITs interest rate risk – i.e., the risk that the value of the bond portfolio held by the trust could decrease if interest rates increase.
Given the current interest rate climate, the following UITs, among others, have interest rate risk that may result in losses to the investor:
