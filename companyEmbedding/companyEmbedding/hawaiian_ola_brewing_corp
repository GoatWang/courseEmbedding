Noni that is not certified organic is cultivated without these considerations. This means, the fruit may have been grown under any variety of conditions.For Hawaiian Ola the organic distinction is important because the Noni we drink is for health, healing, and preserving the Hawaiian Islands. We believe that you truly are what you eat and that eating foods grown without harmful pesticides, GMO’s or fertilizers is better for your health and the health of the environment. Today less than 1% of all AG land in Hawaii is certified organic and most of the worlds Noni is not grown organically.By choosing certified organic Hawaiian Noni, you’re feeding your body some of the best fruit on earth and you’re helping Hawaiian Ola to fulfill our mission: to expand the demand for Organic, GMO-free Hawaiian goods by manufacturing and exporting healthy products made from sustainably grown island-native plants, like Noni. Are Hawaiian Ola Noni Energy and Noni Immunity Shots GMO Free?Yes! As per the USDA NOP Guidelines, in order for Hawaiian Ola to be certified organic, all of the ingredients must be GMO-free.Is there a difference between natural caffeine and synthetic caffeine?The short answer is yes, there are important differences between natural and synthetic caffeine sources. The distinction has to do with where different kinds of caffeine come from. Synthetic caffeine is manufactured in man-made production facilities and is carefully isolated from any impurities. Natural caffeine from plants comes with a variety of plant-based constituents, like phytonutrients, which can change the way the caffeine interacts with your body. To learn more about plant-based caffeine, checkout this post on The Difference Between Natural & Synthetic Caffeine. What is an ideal habitat for growing Noni?Noni grows throughout the tropics, especially in regions blessed with year-round equatorial weather, like Hawaii. Hawaiian Noni grows wild throughout many of the islands eleven micro climates. Some of the largest groves can be found in the Puna region where the soil and climate are especially good for Noni cultivation.This is not to say Noni is a picky plant though. In Hawaii, wild Noni can be found growing near the ocean where salt mixes into it’s growing habitat—even more, Noni is one of the few plants that will grow straight from new lava rock where little water and nutrition are available for vegetation.In Hawaii the number one agricultural export today is conventionally grown GMO corn which, requires a great deal of inputs like water, fertilizer and, pesticides to grow. One of the main reasons we are working to share Hawaiian Noni with the world is that it can be grown sustainably in Hawaii with very few inputs. What should I know about PAHs in Yerba Mate and Cancer Risk?You may have heard some of the recent news about a class of compounds known as PAHs, found in Yerba Mate, that have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Yerba Mate is a healthy plant-based source of herbal energy that has been used in South and Central America for hundreds of years as a rejuvenating source of traditional medicine.With some exceptions, most of the world’s Mate leaves are dried in a high-temperature, smoky process that involves burning Barbacoa wood. The upside to this method is that it dries the leaves quickly—between 8 and 24 hours. Unfortunately, processing Mate leaves in this way has been shown to create Mate with heightened levels of PAHs or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, which are known carcinogens in high concentrations.Because PAHs are found in many common foods and drinks such as water, tea, and coffee, they are almost impossible to avoid completely. However, there are ways of reducing the quantity that you intake by only consuming goods with the lowest possible amounts of PAHs.Fortunately, the Yerba Mate used to caffeinate Hawaiian Ola’s Noni Energy is processed in a way that generates minimal quantities of PAHs. Rather than burning wood to heat-dry, our Mate leaves are air-dried, which takes longer, but produces a final product with much lower quantities of carcinogenic content.In the future, Hawaiian Ola will continue to seek out certified organic sources of Mate containing the lowest amounts of PAHs available, ensuring our consumers are always getting the healthiest product possible. Still curious? Keep asking questions! For more information on Yerba Mate or our other caffeine source, Green Tea, send your questions to contact@hawaiianola.com How many hours of energy will a Hawaiian Ola Noni Energy Shot give me?This is a question we hear often from new Hawaiian Ola drinkers and the answer usually surprises people.Consider this; you wouldn’t buy five mile gasoline for your car or five hour batteries for a flashlight—Right? The reason of course, is that there are many different kinds of cars and flashlights and not all of them have the same energy needs. Well, humans are the same, different bodies prefer different kinds and amounts of energy that work best for each individual.Hawaiian Ola’s Noni Energy Shot contains 160mg of organic, plant-based caffeine; the caffeine comes from organic Yerba Mate and Green Tea. Each shot also contains a variety of super fruits and daily vitamins which, provide a lasting kind of energy that comes from supporting the whole body nutritionally. This unique blend gives drinkers a lift that is sustained and gradual—avoiding the all to common “crash” reported by many energy shot drinkers.While Hawaiian Ola believes that educating consumers about caffeine is important, many popular alternatives do not disclose things like where their caffeine is sourced and how much caffeine is contained in each bottle. This can sometimes make it difficult to understand how much caffeine drinkers are taking and how to compare the effects to other products. The result is consumers measuring energy by hours rather than quantitative criteria such as caffeine and overall nutrition.Next time you’re looking for a healthy boost of energy, try this: apart from staying mindful of how many hours your body is feeling energized, consider these things as well:• How much sugar does your energy shot contain?• Are there any items on the ingredients list that seem unfamiliar to you?• Does the shot contain preservatives?• What in the product offers lasting nutritional support? Ingredients, such as fruits, vegetables and vitamins.• Where does the caffeine come from? A caffeine producing plant or is it synthesized?• Where are water and sugar on the ingredients list?Taking a second look at energy products by asking these questions will help you choose an option that supports your whole body, and maybe even the health of the planet too. To learn more about what goes into the Hawaiian Ola Noni Energy shot, visit our Product Page; you can also learn about the Hawaiian Ola mission to expand the demand for GMO-Free agriculture in Hawaii on our Mission Page. Are Hawaiian Ola’s Hawaiian Noni Shots pasteurized?For many noni drinkers, debates over the best way to drink noni juice are common, especially for those who live in Hawaii, where noni has been grown and prepared traditionally for many years. In these debates, one of the most common topics talked about is whether or not noni should be pasteurized.At Hawaiian Ola our choice to pasteurize our noni juice was not an easy one to make. The subject is complex and there were many pros and cons to weigh in order to make an informed choice. In the end our decision was made to ensure the health, safety, and well being of our drinkers. The FDA strongly recommends that fruit juices like noni be pasteurized and we heed their advice. In this article we explain our decision to pasteurize in detail. We also cite several important sources that helped guide us in our decision-making process. Is Noni Kahanuola a real person?He’s real in your heart. Is the Kiwano Melon the same as Noni Fruit?No sirs, madams, and smizmars, the noni fruit or Morinda Citrifolia may be known by many names including: space fruit, cheese fruit, indian mulberry, and great morinda, but alas none make mention of the kiwano. We’re not entirely sure why there is so much confusion between these two fruits, perhaps it’s due their similar size and preference for warm tropical climates. The kiwano (AKA African horned cucumber, Cucumis Metuliferus, or horned melon) is a rad fruit that grows on a vine and is sweet. Noni, on the other hand, grows on a tree or shrub, and is, well, not really sweet at all. For more information on both of these fruits visit the respective wikis for noni and kiwano. Hawaiian Ola wants to hear more of your questions!If you have something you’d like to see added to the Hawaiian Ola FAQ page, let us know by emailing your inquiry to FAQ@hawaiianola.com.

 the Hawaiian Ola ideaSupport Hawaii’s environment and economy by empowering local farmers producing organic, responsibly grown crops







 







 OUR PHILOSOPHYWhat Responsibly Grown Means To Us WORK WITH THE LANDUse the natural design of the land, ecology, and climate to farm with natureUSE NON-TOXIC METHODSFarm without using chemicals that are toxic for humans or the environmentPLANT THE RIGHT CROPSGrow plants that thrive naturally and compliment their growing environmentSOURCE LOCALLYSource farming inputs like plant starts and amendments locally when possibleSTART WITH GOOD SOILGrowing healthy, nutrient-rich soil is the first step to growing healthy food cropsTHINK LONG TERMInvest in sustainable growing for the future using permaculture techniquesUSE A HOLISTIC APPROACHConsider whole systems and the true impacts (externalities) of farmingALIGN FOOD AND VALUESGrow food in a way that upholds farmer and community stakeholder values  







 Goals For 2020Source 100% of our ingredients from certified organic Hawaiian farmsCreate a demand for one thousand acres of organic Hawaiian farmland and increase total harvested organic crops in Hawaii by 30%Bring two million dollars in new annual Ag income to over sixty small Hawaiian farmsImpact For HawaiiIncreased Hawaiian crop production without increased use of toxic chemicals on the landNew income and farming opportunities for responsible Hawaiian growersNew economic activity for Hawaii coming from organic value added exportsMore healthy, locally grown food and beverage alternatives to imported products for Hawaii shoppers




 our planEncourage growers who farm responsibly by providing them with the support they need to launch and sustain successful farms and by giving them a reliable market to sell their crops.







Organic Farm SupportEmpowering Farmers: Providing growers with key agricultural resources needed to responsibly grow more organic crops in HawaiiOur aim is to create new and lasting farming career opportunities for people in Hawaii by assisting farmers with farm planning, responsible Ag education, and by providing resources, such as locally sourced growing inputs and healthy plant starts.We’re promoting good custodianship of the Hawaiian environment through education on farming and food production techniques that are aligned with our Responsible Growing philosophy. We see value in empowering farmers who consider externalities (the true costs of food production for all stakeholders) to grow more good food!Healthy Products BrandCreating Demand: Bringing responsibly grown Hawaiian crops to market in healthy products made by the Hawaiian Ola brandWe give Hawaiian farmers an equitable market to sell their responsibly grown crops by turning their goods into healthy, value-added consumer products and bringing them to market under the Hawaiian Ola brand. Our brand’s success encourages producers to grow more organic food for local and off-island markets, which supports a more resilient, self-reliant Ag economy in Hawaii.Hawaiian Ola believes in taking an Ag-informed approach to developing products. We collaborate closely with our farm partners to help them make informed decisions about what to grow. They, in turn, help us develop healthy products from ingredients that make good growing sense for farmers.

Maineialoha Kinimaka

I love surfing because it’s a way to express myself while connecting with my Hawaiian roots. Surfing has always played a pivotal role in my family, everything we do revolves around it. Living on an island like Kaua’i, you grow up with an abundance of amazing waves. You’re raised in a lifestyle of being at the beach everyday and surfing until the sun goes down. Surfing is my passion and life wouldn’t be the same without it! 










Kama The Original Surfing Pig

Kama, the legendary surfing pig, is a truly one-of-a-kind member of Hawaiian Ola’s community. Kama lives with his amazing human, Kai, on the North Shore of Oahu where he surfs, eats big sandwiches, and drinks organic Hawaiian Noni Juice. Kama found his love for the ocean at a young age and was a natural water pig. He reminds us that animals can be much more than just food and are, in fact, amazing friends with favorite foods and sports much like humans. If you support animal friends, like Kama, being treated with compassion and respect, share Kama’s story on the web using the hash tag #friendsnotfood and follow Kama’s adventures by visiting his website!WEBSITE: www.kamathesurfingpig.com 










Kalei Kaho’okele

I grew up with an Ohana that started Keahiakahoe Canoe Club, therefore outrigger paddling and being in the ocean has been in my blood for years. I’ve been blessed with a natural feel for the ocean when paddling in a canoe. Of course I will always be at peace when paddling an outrigger canoe, but, priorities have changed and I am currently fulfilling a challenging Olympic sport, Flat water Sprint Kayaking. Opportunities are endless for me, as I am an athlete who has the hunger to learn and soak up as much as possible to the best version of myself. This sport has exposed me to international level competition and elite level training. Representing hawaiian people, hawaiian culture, and best of all HawaiianOla is a huge motivation to achieve my goals; to show the future youth that you should never give up on any dreams that you have. “Kulia I ka nu’u”
