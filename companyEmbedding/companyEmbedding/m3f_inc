Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!
