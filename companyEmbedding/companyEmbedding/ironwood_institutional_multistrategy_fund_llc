	(a)           ICM,
	the Initial Member and their respective Affiliates and each Director (each, an “


	Indemnified Party


	”)
	shall be indemnified by the Fund against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses, and amounts paid in settlement of any claims
	sustained by them in connection with the Fund,

	provided

	actions, on the part of the Board or its Affiliates or such Director.


	 


	(b)           Notwithstanding
	the above, no Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for any losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from or out of an alleged
	violation of U.S. federal or state securities laws unless:  (a) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits
	of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the particular indemnitee; (b) such claims have been dismissed

	and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made.


	 


	(c)           In
	any claim for indemnification resulting from U.S. federal or state securities law violations, the party seeking indemnification
	shall place before the court the position of the SEC or any other applicable regulatory authority with respect to the issue of
	indemnification for securities law violations.

	is herein prohibited.


	 


	(e)           Advances
	by the Fund to an Indemnified Party for legal expenses and other costs incurred as a result of a legal action will be made only
	if the Indemnified Party undertakes to repay the advanced funds, with interest at a risk-free rate from the initial date of such
	advance, to the Fund in cases in which they would not be entitled to indemnification under the first paragraph of this Section
	8.1.


	 


	(f)           In

	(b) that, for the purpose
	of determining any liability under the 1933 Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement

	filed pursuant to Rule 497(b), (c), (d) or (e) under the 1933 Act as part of a registration statement relating to an offering,
	other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A under the 1933 Act, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration
	statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness.

	Provided

	,

	however

	, that no statement made in a registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by
	reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with
	a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement
	or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first
	use.


	 


	(e) that for the purpose
	of determining liability of the Registrant under the 1933 Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities:


	 


	The undersigned Registrant undertakes that
	in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned Registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting
	method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of
	the following communications, the undersigned Registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell
	such securities to the purchaser:  (i) any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned Registrant relating
	to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1933 Act; (ii) the portion of any advertisement pursuant to

	provided by or on behalf of the undersigned Registrant; and (iii) any other communication that is an offer in the offering made
	by the undersigned Registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	(5) Not applicable.


	 


	(6) The Registrant undertakes to send by
	first class mail or other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery, within two business days of receipt of an oral or written

	Exhibit B



	 



	SUPPLEMENT TO THE

	DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT



	 



	Additional Representations, Warranties,
	Agreements and Covenants



	 


	The representations, warranties, agreements
	and covenants given and/or made below are for the benefit of the Distributor and each Sub-Distribution Agent. Each Sub-Distribution
	Agent is explicitly acknowledged, recognized and intended to be a third-party beneficiary under this

	Exhibit B

	to the Supplement.
	Each such Sub-Distribution Agent is referred to as a “Sub-Distribution Agent” below.


	 



	Section


	1.


	Each Fund represents and warrants to
	each Sub-Distribution Agent as follows:



	 


	(a)	The Fund meets the requirements for
	use of Form N-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities Act

	”), the Investment Company
	Act of 1940, as amended (the “

	1940 Act

	”), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	(“

	SEC

	”) under each such Act relating to Form N-2 (or of such successor form as the SEC may adopt). The Fund
	has filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form N-2 and is duly registered as a closed-end management investment company.
	The Prospectus conforms, and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus will conform, in
	all material respects with the Securities Act and 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As used in this

	Exhibit
	B

	, (i) “

	Registration Statement

	” shall mean any registration statement under the 1940 Act and Securities
	Act on Form N-2 relating to the Units, including all exhibits thereto as of the Effective Date of the most recent post-effective
	amendment thereto; (ii) “

	Effective Date

	” shall mean the most recent date that the Registration Statement or
	any post-effective amendment thereto becomes effective; and (iii) “

	Prospectus

	” shall mean any prospectus (including
	any statement of additional information) relating to the Units, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 497 under the Securities Act
	or, if no filing pursuant to Rule 497 is required, the form of final prospectus (including any statement of additional information)
	relating thereto included in any Registration Statement, in each case together with any amendments or supplements thereto.


	 


	(b)	The Fund represents that it shall
	qualify the Units being offered for sale under the securities laws of all U.S. states and territories or, if not, has been advised
	by counsel to the Fund and/or the administrator of the Fund, that the Units being offered are exempt from the requirements of the
	securities laws of each applicable U.S. state or territory. The Fund will maintain such qualifications as long as may be reasonably
	requested by the Sub-Distribution Agent, provided that the Fund shall notify the Sub-Distribution Agent promptly in the event that
	any such qualifications cease to be available.


	 


	(c)	The Fund shall update the Registration
	Statement and the Prospectus, as well as all of the sales materials approved for use on behalf of the Fund, as the same may be
	amended or supplemented, (collectively referred to herein as the “

	Offering Materials

	”) annually or otherwise
	deemed necessary by the Fund to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The Fund will provide copies of any such updated Offering
	Materials on or prior to its applicable effective date






	B-

	1










	 






	 (provided that in the event that such delivery is impracticable, as soon
	as possible following its applicable effective date) and will cooperate with the Sub-Distribution Agent in connection with the
	distribution of any such materials.


	 


	(d)	In connection with subscriptions
	by investors whose Units are to be held in accounts at the Sub-Distribution Agent or an affiliate thereof, the Fund shall use forms
	of a Subscription Agreement and a Subscription Agreement signature page as mutually agreed to by the Fund, the Distributor and
	each applicable Sub-Distribution Agent.


	 


	(e)	The Fund has been duly formed and
	is validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation with power and authority to conduct its business as described
	in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to offer and sell the Units as contemplated by the Registration Statement
	and the Prospectus and the Distribution Agreement, as supplemented hereby. The Fund is duly qualified to transact business, is
	in good standing, as of the date hereof and as of each time (a “

	Closing Time

	”) that Units are sold hereunder,
	will be in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
	failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, of the Fund, or the earnings,
	business affairs or business prospects of the Fund.


	 


	(f)	All of the issued and outstanding
	Units of the Fund have been duly authorized and validly issued units of limited liability company interests; the Units to be issued
	as contemplated by this Agreement have been authorized by requisite action on the part of the Fund and its Board of Directors (the
	“

	Fund Board

	”), when issued and delivered against payment in accordance with the provisions of the relevant subscription
	documents, will be validly issued units of limited liability company interests; and the issuance of the Units by the Fund is not
	subject to preemptive rights except as may be disclosed in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, provided, however, that if
	the Fund proposes to amend its Registration Statement and other documentation to provide for such pre-emptive rights, excluding
	such rights established in connection with Fund investments, the Fund shall notify the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent
	at least 30 days in the advance of the implementation of any such changes. The Fund does not have any outstanding options to purchase
	or any rights or warrants to subscribe for, or any securities or obligations convertible into, any Units except as may be disclosed
	in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, provided, however, that if the Fund proposes to amend its Registration Statement
	to issue options to purchase or any rights or warrants to subscribe for, or any securities or obligations convertible into, any
	Units, the Fund shall notify the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent at least 30 days in the advance of the implementation
	of any such changes.


	 


	(g)	(i)The Fund is not in material violation
	of its organizational documents or in material default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant
	or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, fiscal agency agreement, note, lease or other instrument
	to which it is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its assets is subject; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance
	by the Fund of, and compliance with, the Distribution Agreement, the Advisory Agreement, the Fund’s amended and restated
	limited liability company agreement, the custody agreement, administration agreement, the regulatory and compliance support services
	agreement, the transfer agency agreement and other related agreements and constituent documents (collectively, the “

	Operative
	Documents

	”), in each case to which it is a party, and the consummation by the Fund of the






	B-

	2










	 






	transactions contemplated hereunder
	and thereunder will not materially conflict with, or result in a material breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute,
	with or without the giving of a notice or lapse of time or both, a material default under, or result in the creation or imposition
	of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of the Fund pursuant to, or give any other party a right
	to terminate any of its obligations under, or result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any contract, indenture, mortgage,
	loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which the Fund is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of the
	property or assets of the Fund is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of or conflict with the terms or provisions
	of the Operative Documents or any law, order, judgment, decree, rule or regulation applicable to the Fund; and (iii) no consent,
	approval, authorization or order of, or any filing or declaration with, any court or governmental authority or agency, national
	securities exchange or securities or futures association is required for the consummation by the Fund of the transactions contemplated
	by this Agreement (except such filings as may be required under the Securities Act or state securities laws, which will be timely
	filed) or the Fund’s Operative Documents.


	 


	(h)	At each date of issue as well as
	at each Closing Time, all Offering Materials did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
	a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and are otherwise
	in compliance with applicable laws.


	 


	(i)	Since the Effective Date of the Registration
	Statement and the Prospectus, except as otherwise disclosed therein, there has been no material adverse change in the condition,
	financial or otherwise, business affairs or business prospects of the Fund and there is no action, suit or proceeding before or
	by any court or governmental agency or body, U.S. or non-U.S., now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Fund, threatened against
	or affecting the Fund, the Adviser or any of their respective shareholders, members, principal stockholders or officers or directors,
	as the case may be, which adverse change, action, suit or proceeding is expected to impair or adversely affect in any material
	respect the ability of the Fund or the Adviser to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
	to perform their respective obligations under any Operative Document, or, in the case of the Fund, to sell its Units.


	 


	(j)	The Operative Documents have been
	duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the Fund and the Fund Board in compliance with applicable law, including,
	without limitation the 1940 Act, and have been executed and delivered by the Fund. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
	by the other parties thereto with respect to the Operative Documents, each such Operative Document constitutes a valid and legally
	binding agreement of the Fund, enforceable against the Fund in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be subject to
	the effects of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws now or hereafter
	in effect relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
	considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.


	 


	(k)	Any offering of Units by the Fund
	made or to be made within the United States was or will be made, as applicable, in compliance with U.S. federal and state securities
	and






	B-

	3










	 






	commodities laws, and any offering of
	Units by the Fund made or to be made outside the U.S. was or will be made, as applicable, in compliance with local laws.


	 


	(l)	So long as Fund capacity exists and
	subject to Fund Board approval, the Fund will (i) make available an aggregate investment capacity in the Fund of at least two hundred
	fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) per annum for the sale of Units by the Sub-Distribution Agent and (ii) provide additional
	capacity to the Sub-Distribution Agent during any period in which capacity is available to other Fund distributors, sub-distributors
	or other selling agents. The Fund will consider making additional investment capacity available to the Sub-Distribution Agent if
	the Fund’s annual allotted capacity is reached.


	 


	(m)	The Fund has policies, procedures
	and internal controls in place that are implemented by its administrator that are reasonably designed to comply with the Uniting
	and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001
	(the “

	PATRIOT Act

	”), including a customer identification program, and the regulations administered by the U.S.
	Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“

	OFAC

	”).


	 


	(n)	Any certificate signed by any executive
	officer of the Fund and delivered to the Sub-Distribution Agent or to counsel for the Sub-Distribution Agent shall be deemed a
	representation and warranty by the Fund to the Sub-Distribution Agent as to the matters covered thereby.


	 


	(o)	The Fund shall promptly inform the
	Sub-Distribution Agent in the event that any of them has reason to believe that any of the representations and warranties made
	herein are no longer true and accurate in all material respects.


	 


	(p)	The sale of Units by broker-dealers
	is governed by NASD Rule 2830 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“

	FINRA

	”) and is not subject
	to the compensation provisions of FINRA Rule 5110.


	 


	(q)	The Fund operates pursuant to an
	exemption provided by Rule 4.5 under the Commodity Exchange Act in order to avoid regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool. The
	Fund will notify the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent promptly in the event that the Fund elects to register as a commodity
	pool, provided that the parties acknowledge the recent changes to CFTC regulations which may require the Fund to register as a
	commodity pool prior to December 31, 2012.


	 


	(r)	While the Fund has permitted the
	Sub-Distribution Agent to obtain information concerning strategy types, backgrounds, histories and identities (among other things)
	of Fund portfolio managers as part of the Sub-Distribution Agent’s due diligence process, the Fund acknowledges and agrees
	that none of the Sub-Distribution Agents, any of their respective affiliates or any owner, officer, employee or representatives
	of the foregoing in their capacity as such has any responsibility for (among other things) the Units, the Fund or the performance
	of an investment in the Units, including, without limitation, any responsibility for the sponsorship or management of the Fund,
	the business terms of the Fund, the selection of portfolio managers and underlying fund investments, the allocation of the Fund’s
	assets among the underlying fund






	B-

	4










	 






	investments, or the performance of or disclosures concerning the Fund (except for any disclosures
	about the Sub-Distribution Agent that have been requested to be included by the Sub-Distribution Agent).


	 



	Section
	2.


	  Each Fund covenants to each
	Sub-Distribution Agent as follows:



	 


	(a)	The Fund will deliver, or cause the
	Adviser to deliver, to the Sub-Distribution Agent, or the Sub-Distribution Agent’s designated distribution center, as promptly
	as practicable such number of copies of the Fund’s Offering Materials (as the same may be amended or supplemented) as the
	Sub-Distribution Agent may reasonably request in writing, such delivery at the expense of the Fund.


	 


	(b)	If any event relating to or affecting
	the Fund occurs as a result of which the Fund believes that it has become necessary to amend or supplement the Offering Materials
	so that they do not contain a material misstatement or omission, the Fund will so inform the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution
	Agent and will prepare and furnish to the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent a reasonable number of copies of an amendment
	or amendments of, or a supplement or supplements to, the Offering Materials which will amend or supplement the Offering Materials
	so that as so amended or supplemented the Fund has reason to believe that such Offering Materials do not contain any material misstatement
	or omission.

	(g)	The Fund will provide, or cause to
	be provided, its net asset values to the Sub-Distribution Agent on a monthly basis.

	th

	business day of the following month, monthly performance summaries by the twentieth (20th) day of the following

	the date hereof, the maximum amount of all items of compensation payable to the Sub-Distribution Agent shall not exceed 6.25% of

	and the Sub-Distribution Agent promptly in writing of: (i) any material correspondence or other communication by the SEC or its
	staff relating to or otherwise impacting the sale and offering of Units of the Fund, including requests by the SEC for amendments
	to the Registration Statement or Prospectus of the Fund; (ii) the issuance by the SEC of any stop-order suspending the effectiveness
	of the Registration Statement of the Fund then in effect or the initiation of any proceeding for that purpose; (iii) the happening
	of any event which makes untrue any statement of a material fact made in the Prospectus of the Fund or which requires the making
	of a change in such Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (iv) all actions taken by the SEC with respect
	to any amendments to any Registration Statement or Prospectus of such Fund which may from time to time be filed with the SEC; (v)
	the Fund’s determination to suspend the sale of Units at any time in response to conditions in the securities markets or
	otherwise; and (vi) the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or directors, in
	connection with the issue and sale of any of its Units.

	the term of this Agreement, it may have access to confidential or proprietary information of the Sub-Distribution Agent, including
	information relating to the Sub-Distribution Agents systems, procedures, manuals, products,






	B-

	contracts, personnel, and clients,
	and that it will not disclose (or, except in the course of providing services hereunder, otherwise use) confidential or proprietary
	information regarding the Sub-Distribution Agent without the Sub-Distribution Agent’s written consent (except that disclosure
	will be permitted if the information is otherwise publicly available or as required by applicable law or governmental order).


	 


	(m)	As of the date hereof, the Fund,
	has provided the Sub-Distribution Agent with a list of each Affiliated Person (as defined in the 1940 Act), promoter and principal
	underwriter of the Fund (first-tier affiliates), as well as each of their respective Affiliated Persons (second-tier affiliates)
	and, upon the request of the Sub-Distribution Agent, shall promptly notify the Sub-Distribution Agent in the event of any changes
	thereto.


	 


	(n)	The Fund agrees to accept all subscriptions
	to the Fund pursuant to the subscription deadlines set forth in Prospectus and in accordance with the Distribution Agreement, this
	Supplement and any applicable provisions of the dealer agreement between the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent, provided
	that, the Fund has complete discretion to reject any such investments. Client accounts will be debited and funds will be wired
	to the Fund at least three (3) business days prior to the first day of each month.


	 


	(o)	Notwithstanding anything in the Offering
	Materials to the contrary, Sub-Distribution Agent customers will be required to submit repurchase requests to the Sub-Distribution
	Agent by the applicable repurchase offer deadline for the Fund and the Sub-Distribution Agent will notify the Fund of such repurchase
	requests within two (2) calendar days thereafter.


	 


	(p)	The Fund shall notify the Sub-Distribution
	Agent of any significant changes to the business or operations of the Fund.


	 


	(q)	As deemed appropriate by the Fund,
	in consultation with the Fund’s legal counsel, the Fund shall cooperate with the Sub-Distribution Agent to include (i) appropriate
	revenue sharing language in the Offering Materials indicating the fact that the Adviser currently compensates selling agents from
	its own resources in connection with the sale of Fund Units and the servicing of investors and (ii) such disclaimer language in
	the Offering Materials, as the Sub-Distribution Agent may reasonably request. Except as advised by the Fund’s legal counsel

	regarding the Sub-Distribution Agent without the express prior consent of the Sub-Distribution Agent.


	 


	(r)	The Fund shall provide the Sub-Distribution
	Agent with full transparency regarding the Fund’s percentage allocation to each Portfolio Fund in accordance with the Fund’s
	portfolio holdings disclosure policy and the Fund shall notify the Sub-Distribution in advance of any changes to the Fund’s
	portfolio holdings disclosure policy that would limit the Sub-Distribution Agent’s transparency hereunder.


	 


	(s)	The Fund shall not publicly disparage
	the Sub-Distribution Agent or its affiliates or any of their owners, officers, employees or representatives regarding the matters
	contemplated






	B-

	by the Distribution Agreement, this Supplement and any applicable provisions of the dealer agreement between the Distributor
	and the Sub-Distribution Agent.


	 


	(t)	The Fund and its affiliates and related
	parties will not knowingly, directly or indirectly, solicit, suggest, induce or encourage any current client of the Sub-Distribution
	Agent to invest or seek business opportunities with the Distributor, the Adviser, the Fund or their respective affiliates and related
	parties. The Fund also agrees not to permit any sales or other investment by any investors in the Fund that the Fund knows (or
	has reason to believe based on prior meetings, provision by the Sub-Distribution Agent of any prospect lists or information provided
	to the Fund in any subscription or other written agreement) to be a client of the Sub-Distribution Agent except as may be agreed
	by the parties. The Fund shall not pay, directly or indirectly, any selling commissions, fee or other compensation to any distribution
	or selling agent with respect to any Members that are clients of the Sub-Distribution Agent and which the Sub-Distribution Agent
	can demonstrate it introduced to the Fund except as provided hereunder.


	 


	(u)	The Fund may not disseminate any
	written reference relating to the Sub-Distribution Agent or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries relating in any respect to the
	transactions contemplated by this Supplement or the applicable provisions of the dealer agreement between the Distributor and the
	Sub-Distribution Agent without the prior written consent of the Sub-Distribution Agent.


	 


	(v)	All representations, warranties and
	agreements made by the Fund and contained in this Supplement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of
	any investigation made by, or on behalf of, the Sub-Distribution Agent or the Distributor or any person who controls any of the
	foregoing, and shall survive each Closing Time in the form restated and reaffirmed as of each such Closing Time.


	 



	Section


	3.


	Each Fund agrees as follows:



	 


	(a)	The Fund shall indemnify and hold
	harmless (i) the Distributor Indemnitees (as such term is defined in the Distribution Agreement), (ii) each Sub-Distribution Agent,
	any of its respective affiliates or any owner, officer, employee or representatives of the foregoing in their capacity as such,
	and (iii) any persons controlling the persons listed in clause (ii) hereof within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
	Act (collectively, the “

	Indemnified Parties

	”) from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or
	several, and any action in respect thereof, to which the Indemnified Party may become subject or otherwise, insofar as such loss,
	claim, damage, liability or action relates to or arises out of (i) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Offering
	Materials, or the omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any
	material breach by the Fund of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in the Distribution Agreement or this Supplement,
	and shall reimburse such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability
	or action; provided, however, that the Fund will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
	liability or action relates to or arises out of any untrue statement or omission contained in the Offering Materials relating to
	the Sub-Distribution Agent or to any affiliate of the Sub-Distribution Agent or that was made in reliance upon and in conformity
	with information furnished to the Manager, the






	B-

	8










	 






	Distributor or the Fund in writing by the Sub-Distribution Agent or any Affiliate
	of the Sub-Distribution Agent, in any such case expressly for use in the Offering Materials.


	 


	(b)	Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
	Party under this

	Section 3

	of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party shall, if a
	claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this

	Section 3

	, notify the Fund in writing of
	the claim or the commencement of that action provided that the failure to notify the Fund will not relieve the Fund from any liability
	which it may have to an Indemnified Party unless, and solely to the extent that, such failure materially affects the Fund’s
	case. If any such claim or action is brought against any Indemnified Party, and it shall notify the Fund, the Fund shall be entitled
	to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified party, to assume the defense
	thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
	After notice from the Fund to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Fund shall
	not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this

	Section 3

	for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
	Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation in connection with the defense.
	The Indemnified Party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges
	of such counsel will be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnified Party
	has been authorized in writing by the Fund, (ii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the Indemnified
	Party) between the Indemnified Party and the Fund (in which case the Fund will not have the right to direct the defense of such
	action on behalf of the Indemnified Party), or (iii) the Fund has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action
	within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees,
	disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the Fund. The Fund will not be liable for any settlement of
	any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).


	 


	(c)	The indemnity provided by this

	Section
	3

	shall not relieve the Fund from any liability any such party may otherwise have.


	 


	(d)	The provisions of this

	Section
	3

	shall survive termination of the Distribution Agreement.


	 



	Section


	4.


	Each Fund agrees as follows:



	 


	With respect to each Sub-Distribution Agent,
	the Fund agrees not to waive or amend any terms of the Supplement to the Distribution Agreement which would affect any of the third
	party beneficiary rights granted to the respective Sub-Distribution Agent, or impact the ability of the Sub-Distribution Agent
	to perform its obligations under the applicable provisions of the dealer agreement between the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution
	Agent and in accordance with this Supplement, including Exhibit B hereto, without providing at least thirty (30) days prior written
	notice to the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution Agent. The Fund shall promptly notify the Distributor and the Sub-Distribution
	Agent of any other amendments, supplements to or waivers of the provisions of the Distribution Agreement, as Supplemented hereby.

Ironwood Multi-Strategy Fund LLC, et al., April 20, 2017

















Home | Previous Page





























Securities Act of 1933 â Section 6(b)Securities Exchange Act of 1934 â Section 13(e) and Rule 0-11
Ironwood Multi-Strategy Fund LLC and Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund LLC

Your letter of April 18, 2017 ("Incoming Letter") requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act")[1] or Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")[2] and Rule 0-11 thereunder[3] against Ironwood Multi-Strategy Fund LLC ("Feeder Fund") or Ironwood Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund LLC ("Master Fund"), if Feeder Fund does not pay registration fees on shares it sells to the public or tender offer registration fees on shares it offers to repurchase from the public.
You state that Master Fund and Feeder Fund are registered closed-end investment companies that operate in a "master-feeder" structure. You represent that because Master Fund pays (a) registration fees on all of its shares sold, including shares sold to Feeder Fund, and (b) tender offer registration fees on all of its shares it offers to repurchase, including shares repurchased from Feeder Fund, requiring Feeder Fund to pay registration fees on shares it sells to the public and tender offer registration fees on shares it offers to repurchase from the public essentially results in "double counting" of registration fees and tender offer registration fees for shareholders of Feeder Fund. You further represent that (x) all shares sold by Feeder Fund have corresponding purchases of Master Fund shares by Feeder Fund and (y) all shares repurchased from the public by Feeder Fund have corresponding repurchases of Master Fund shares from Feeder Fund. You state that you believe this proposed fee arrangement is consistent with existing Division guidance relating to registration fees of open-end management investment companies operating in a master-feeder structure.[4]
Based on the facts and representations made in your letter, we would not recommend any enforcement action to the Commission under Section 6(b) of the Securities Act or Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act or Rule 0-11 thereunder against Feeder Fund or Master Fund if Feeder Fund does not pay registration fees on shares it sells to the public or tender offer registration fees on shares it offers to repurchase from the public.
This response is based upon all of the facts and representations made in your letter. You should note that any different facts or representations may require the Divisions to reach a different conclusion. This response expresses the Division's position on enforcement action only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the questions presented. 


Mark N. Zaruba
Senior Counsel
Chief Counsel's Office
April 19, 2017




[1] Section 6(b) of the Securities Act requires an issuer of securities to pay, at the time of filing of a registration statement, a prescribed fee based on the aggregate price of securities to be offered.


[2] Section 13(e)(1) of the Exchange Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, address the repurchase of equity securities issued by a closed-end investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"). Section 13(e)(3) of the Exchange Act requires a registered closed-end investment company to pay, at the time of filing of a repurchase notice required by Section 13(e)(1) or the rules promulgated thereunder, a prescribed fee based on the aggregate price of the securities to be repurchased.


[3] Rule 0-11under the Exchange Act requires an issuer repurchasing securities pursuant to Section 13(e)(1) of the Exchange Act to pay, at the time of filing of repurchase notice required by Section 13(e)(1) or the rules promulgated thereunder, a prescribed fee based on the aggregate price of the securities to be repurchased.


[4] In particular, you state the Division has granted no-action relief under Section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act that allows open-end funds operating in a master-feeder structure to avoid double counting of registration fees by disregarding share sales from master fund to feeder fund, so long as the corresponding feeder fund shares provided for their own fees. See American Council of Life Insurance, SEC No-Action Letter (pub. avail. June 20, 1995) and GMO Trust, SEC No-Action Letter (pub. avail. May 24, 2012). As you note, however, Section 24(f) of the Investment Company Act is not applicable to closed-end funds, which means that closed-end funds that operate in a master-feeder structure are not able to take advantage of existing Division guidance to avoid the double-counting of registration fees.
