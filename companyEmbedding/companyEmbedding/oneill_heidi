Introduction




About Us
O’Neill Landscape Design and Installation was formed to provide a full range of landscape-design-build services. Our practice is evolving from providing design services primarily for the private sector to incorporating large scale life style and mixed use commercial and public projects.
We offer the skills of a registered Landscape Architect. We collaborate with a network of dedicated landscape contractors, engineers, surveyors, and sculptors who provide considerable experience, quality, and cost control to each individual project ranging in scale and scope.
We provide hands on project and site management and a personal commitment to see a project develop. With Cleveland as our base we continue to offer our services to the local community. We also consult nationally and internationally and through our network provide expert horticultural and environmental knowledge.
Philosophy
We are determined to create environmentally sound, sustainable landscapes that have a strong artistic and aesthetic focus, a sense of identity and atmosphere and engage people within their living spaces.
As a designer with innovative design experience, we have a respect for budgets, an eye for detail, and a commitment to interpreting the clients’ visions into exciting projects that demand attention.
Referrals
A referral is the best compliment we can receive. We reward successful referrals.
Please be sure to let us know…you’ll be thankful you did!
