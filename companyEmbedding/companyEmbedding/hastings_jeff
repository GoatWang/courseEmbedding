                                                  Agency. She joins our staff 
                                                  in the capacity of website development 
                                                  and support.
Prior to her position here,

                                                  her. She knows what it takes 
                                                  to run a small business. She 
                                                  understands the time constraints 
                                                  of small business owners and

                                                  to outsource as much of the 
                                                  human resource function of a 
                                                  business as possible; thereby 
                                                  freeing owners up to concentrate 
                                                  on those functions that are 
                                                  revenue-producing.

When competing at the 1984 Olympic Winter Games, Hastings finished fourth on the large hill, placing just behind Pavel Ploc of Czechoslovakia, 2/10ths of a point out of the medals.[2] This was the best American finish in ski jumping since the 1920s. Hastings finished fourth overall on the World Cup circuit in 1984, was US national champion four times,[3] and won a World Cup in Lake Placid on the large hill in 1983.
Since retiring from competition in 1985, Hastings has served as a television ski-jumping analyst for several Winter Olympics games, from Calgary 1988 to Vancouver 2010.[4]
Hastings is currently the President of PRO-CUT International, an automotive specialty product supply company located in West Lebanon, New Hampshire.[5]

			BrightSign CEO Jeff Hastings Discusses New Product Lines			
 0


By 
				Jason Kushner - DSC Editor

 
September 28, 2016


MEDIA PLAYERS










BrightSign recently announced seven new state-of-the-art media players spanning four product lines in response to the ever-changing needs of the digital signage and audiovisual industries. The free BrightAuthor companion software and the Brightsign Network have also been updated with advanced features in what basically amounts to an attempt at future-proofing the entire BrightSign product family. Digital Signage Connection caught up with the company’s CEO Jeff Hastings to get more details.
“Five years ago, we pioneered the 4K H.265 decoding to decrease file sizes by up to 60 percent,” said Hastings. “That’s going to become the industry norm over the next three to five years, and we’d like to think that we’re continuing that trend of blazing trails with the capabilities of the new product lines.”
One of the most exciting new additions is known as Mosaic Mode, and it allows the screen to be divided into zones that add up to the full resolution of the decoder. The screen zones could be for a practical purpose or entirely impressionistic if the signage is intended more as décor or ambience. The bottom line here is that the new line offers much more control to the author.
According to Hastings, the most notable new features other than Mosaic Mode are more contrast with a wider color palette, the thinner displays to meet ADI requirements, the ability to stream content to another player in real time, and most importantly, an industrial-grade design with 4K capability at a low price point. In addition, the CPU is bonded to an aluminum case for heat dissipation so no cooling fan is necessary, plus the thinner bodies make these players less clunky and more aesthetically pleasing for a customer-facing or corporate office environment.
“You can, but you won’t want to hide this player behind the display,” Hastings added.
In terms of support, BrightSign will continue to provide technological advice to customers with the current media player generation, plus one generation back. For a full breakdown of the company’s new product line, see the descriptions below:
