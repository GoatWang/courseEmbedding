Explore Precious Metals
Why should investors care about precious metals, and more importantly, why should they go to the trouble of allocating to this asset class? In short, the answer is potentially better risk-adjusted returns. Since 2000, investors in a basket of precious metals have benefited from relatively higher returns with lower risk7. Thanks to the low correlation to equities and fixed income that precious metals often exhibit, in many circumstances precious metals may provide a diversification benefit, helping to offset swings in equities and fixed income. Indeed, during severe market corrections, precious metals tend to perform positively, in some cases functioning as a hedge, and providing some measure of protection during selloffs.
At ETF Securities, we offer a broad suite of physically-backed precious metals exchange traded funds (ETFs) to help investors reach their investment goals. In certain environments, our commodities focused offerings below may provide diversification benefits in an effort to boost risk-adjusted returns.

ETF Securities Launches New Precious Metals Basket (GLTR)




First US-Based Product to Offer Gold, Silver, Platinum and 
      Palladium under a Single Ticker






October 21, 2010 09:21 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ETF Securities announced today that ETFS Precious Metals Basket shares 
      will list on the NYSE Arca on October 22, 2010 trading under the ticker 
      symbol GLTR “Glitter”.
    

Key highlights of GLTR:



Unique offering: ETFS Physical Precious Metal Basket Shares 
        (Ticker: GLTR) will be the first US-based physically backed 
        precious metal basket ETP to hold gold, silver, platinum and palladium 
        in fixed weights. GLTR complements the existing suite of 
        products provided by ETF Securities and continues to offer the 
        broadest range of physically backed precious metal ETPs in the US 
        market.
      

Precious metals Basket: It is expected that GLTR will appeal to 
        those investors looking for a “one size fits all” ETP for their 
        precious metal exposure.(8)


Cost effective: The Sponsor’s Fee for GLTR will be 0.60%(3).
It is expected that the transaction costs for buying and selling 
        the Shares will be lower than purchasing, storing and insuring 
        physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
      

Liquid(6) – The Shares will trade on 
        the NYSE Arca. The Trust structure allows for shares to be created and 
        redeemed according to supply and demand in the market.
      

Transparent – The gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion 
        held by the trust is inspected biannually by the independent metal 
        assayer, Inspectorate International. The pricing information, net 
        asset value, and precious metals bar numbers held by the Trust are 
        published daily on our website www.etfsecurities.com.
      

Flexible - The shares are available to be bought or sold, like 
        ordinary listed securities throughout the trading day. The shares are 
        eligible for margin accounts.
      


ETFS Precious Metals Basket Trust


      The objective of the ETFS Precious Metals Basket Trust (GLTR) shares 
      reflect the performance of the price of Gold, Silver, Platinum and 
      Palladium, less the Trust’s expenses. The Trust is open ended and is 
      designed for investors who want a cost-effective (1) and 
      convenient (2) way to invest in all four precious metals as 
      well as diversify their precious metal holdings. The product has an 
      gross expense ratio of 0.60% per annum. (3)


      The Shares represent beneficial interest in the Trust, which holds 
      physical allocated gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion held in 
      vaults by the Custodian (JP Morgan Chase Bank). All physical bullion 
      held with JP Morgan Chase Bank conforms to the London Bullion Market 
      Association’s (LBMA)(4) and London Platinum and Palladium 
      Market Association’s (LPPM)(5) rules for Good Delivery. Gold 
      and Silver will be held in London and Platinum and Palladium will be 
      held in London or Zurich.
    

      ETF Securities is the first US ETF Sponsor to provide investors with 
      access to a full suite of precious metal ETPs. Investors can now trade 
      physically-backed Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium & Precious Metals 
      Basket ETPs from the same provider. The five precious metal ETPs have 
      the following key features:
    


        Track spot price of underlying metal less associated management fees(1)


        Physically backed by underlying bullion – minimal counterparty risk
      

        Gold, Silver, Platinum & Palladium vaulted in London and Switzerland
      

        Bullion holdings audited by specialist audit firm biannually – audit 
        reports published on the website www.etfsecurities.com


        Bullion bar list published on website
      

        Low cost(1)


        Options (2) are trading on ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares 
        (SGOL) and ETFS Physical Silver Shares (SIVR).
      


Commenting on Friday’s listing of the ETFS Physical Precious Metal 
      Basket on NYSE ARCA, Fred Jheon, Head of Product and Business Development
of ETFS Marketing LLC, said:


      “GLTR was developed in response to demand from a diverse client base 
      looking for a single ticker solution that provides cost-effective 
      precious metals exposure in a physically-backed fund. GLTR complements 
      the existing four individual precious metals products ETF Securities 
      offers to US investors - SIVR, SGOL, PPLT and PALL - and allows our 
      clients to either hold each product individually or customize according 
      to their investment outlook. We believe that the introduction of this 
      unique product will fill a need in the marketplace and position ETF 
      Securities for further growth in the US.”
    

      ETF Securities Ltd (ETFS), one of the world's leading providers of 
      Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), is independently owned and currently 
      has USD $22 billion (as of September 28, 2010) of assets invested in 
      over 180 of its products globally.
    

      The new listing comes from the same management team who created ETFS 
      Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL) and ETFS Physical Silver Shares (SIVR) 
      in 2009, as well as ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (PPLT) and ETFS 
      Physical Palladium Shares (PALL) in January 2010, which have combined 
      assets under management of US$2bn as of September 28th, 2010.

The ETFS Precious Metals Basket Trust, The ETFS Gold Trust, ETFS 
      Silver Trust, ETFS Palladium Trust and ETFS Platinum Trust are not 
      investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 
      or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. Shares 
      of the Trusts are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as 
      mutual funds. These investments are not suitable for all investors. 
      Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.


(1) The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs 
      associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market 
      and the payment of the Trusts ongoing expenses will be lower than the 
      costs associated with buying, selling, storing and insuring Gold, 
      Silver, Palladium and Platinum bullion in a traditional allocated Gold 
      and Silver bullion account.
    

(2) The Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca and will provide 
      institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the Gold, 
      Silver, Palladium and Platinum bullion market.
    

(3) Ordinary brokerage fees do apply.
    

(4) The LBMA Good Delivery list represents the de facto 
      standard for the quality of gold and silver bars. Stringent criteria for 
      assaying standards and specifications for weight, dimensions, 
      fineness/purity that identify and validate marks and appearance of the 
      bars must be met to qualify as being London Good Delivery bar.
    

(5) The LPPM Good Delivery list represents the de facto 
      standard for the quality of palladium and platinum bars. Stringent 
      criteria for assaying standards and specifications for weight, 
      dimensions, fineness/purity that identify and validate marks and 
      appearance of the bars must be met to qualify as being London Good 
      Delivery bar.
    

(6)The lack of a market for the shares of the fund may limit 
      the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.
    

(8) ETFS Physical Precious Metal Basket includes gold, 
      silver, platinum, and palladium commodities.
    

      Fred Jheon is a registered representative of ALPS Distributors Inc.
    

Risks and Important Considerations


      The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the gold, 
      silver, palladium and platinum held by the Trusts and fluctuations in 
      the price of gold, silver, palladium and platinum could materially 
      adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Several factors may affect 
      the price of gold, silver, palladium and platinum, including: A change 
      in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the 
      price of gold, silver, palladium and platinum. Gold, silver, palladium 
      and platinum are used in a wide range of industrial applications, and an 
      economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, 
      consequently, its price and the price of the Shares; Investors' 
      expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; Currency exchange 
      rates; Interest rates; Investment and trading activities of hedge funds 
      and commodity funds; and global or regional political, economic or 
      financial events and situations. Should there be an increase in the 
      level of hedge activity of bullion producing companies, it could cause a 
      decline in world prices, adversely affecting the price of the Shares. 
      Also, should the speculative community take a negative view towards 
      bullion, it could cause a decline in world gold, silver, palladium and 
      platinum prices, negatively impacting the price of the Shares. There is 
      a risk that part or all of the Trust's gold, silver, palladium and 
      platinum could be lost, damaged or stolen. Failure by the Custodian or 
      Sub-Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the precious 
      metal held by the Trusts could result in a loss to the Trusts.
    

      The Trusts are new and have limited operating history. Commodities 
      generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. 
      Trusts focusing on a single commodity generally experience greater 
      volatility.
    

      Shares in the Trusts are not FDIC insured, may lose value and have no 
      bank guarantee.

3 Precious Metal ETFs Take Basket Approach






Don Dion



May 19, 2011 6:00 AM EDT













 


















































 NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Precious metals have become a major region of interest for ETF fund sponsors. Since its introduction in late 2004, the physically based SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD) has taken off in popularity, gathering over $60 billion in assets, making it the second largest ETF in the world.  Over the ensuing years, the success of this fund has been noticed by large and small providers. Many, attempting to profit from interest in this corner of the market, have launched their own funds designed to offer ways to gain access to these shiny resources. While some firms, like Global X and Market Vectors, have opted to take the equity-based route with miner funds like the Global X Silver Miners ETF ( SIL) and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( GDX) respectively, others have chosen to use futures contracts or physical stockpiles to provide investors with direct access to their desired metals. Many of the physically based single commodity precious metal ETFs like GLD, iShares Silver Trust ( SLV) and ETFS Physical Palladium Shares ( PALL) have proven wildly popular amongst investors. Sensing persistent rampant demand for these shiny metals, providers have continued to develop and evolve their product lines, offering new and unique ways to gain direct access to these commodities. One particularly interesting development has been the introduction of precious metal basket funds. Today, using products offered by companies such as ETF Securities and PowerShares, investors can instantly tap into two or more precious metals at the same time. These consolidated precious metals funds may prove popular for a variety of different scenarios. For instance, precious metal bulls who prefer a hands-off approach to investing may find the ETFS Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares ( GLTR) to be ideally suited.  This fund is a one-stop-shop precious metal ETF, combining exposure to four resources: gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. According to the fund's Website, each share exposes investors to approximately 0.3 ounces of gold; 1.1 ounces of silver; 0.004 ounces of platinum; and 0.006 ounces of palladium. ETF Securities' ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares ( WITE), meanwhile, may prove more attractive for those looking for an active approach to precious metal investing. Each share of WITE provides investors with exposure to a combination of silver, platinum and palladium. According to its sponsor, WITE's per-share metal entitlement is approximately 1.0 ounce of silver; 0.01 ounce of platinum; and 0.08 ounce of palladium.

Why invest in precious metals?
We believe gold is an important hedge during uncertain conditions, since it tends to have a low correlation to the broader economic environment. With heightened concerns around European bank liquidity, the risk of Brexit* and uncertainty regarding US presidency candidates it's no surprise that investors are returning to gold as a diversifier and potential safe haven investment. ETF Securities is a global pioneer in exchange traded products (ETPs) having developed the world's first gold ETP in 2003.**
Silver remains cheap relative to gold, with the gold-to-silver price ratio at the highest since 2008 (as of February 1, 2016). The gold-to-silver ratio rose to the highest level since the global financial crisis. Silver is cheaper compared to gold at this stage and should its historic correlation with gold re-establish itself, there appears to be catch-up potential for the metal. With silver being a by-product of mining for other metals, and mining activity paring back, we believe silver is likely to enter another year of supply deficit.
Platinum and palladium benefit from rising wealth in emerging markets. Rapidly increasing emerging market lifestyles, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and coincident auto sales together with tightening global emission standards are causing a structural shift in the demand for platinum and palladium. While investors are familiar with gold and its investment benefits, and silver with its more industrial demand focus, less well known are platinum and palladium. The majority of the demand for platinum and palladium is industrial for emissions controls through the use of catalytic converters. A key advantage platinum and palladium have over other bulk industrial metals are the low storage costs associated with precious metals.
Why invest in precious metal ETFs?

Cost-effective
Accessible
Transparent
Simple



Precious Metal ETFs offer a cost efficient way to participate in the gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion market without having to take physical delivery of the gold itself.


ETFs can be bought and sold whenever the stock exchange is open as prices are quoted throughout the day.


Unlike other investment vehicles, ETF constituents are published on a daily basis. This transparency makes it easier for the investor to see exactly what they own.


ETFs are listed and trade in a similar way as shares through the same brokers and platforms.


Why invest in a basket of precious metal ETFs?
Precious metals (PMs) are classified as currencies. When referenced in this piece, a ‘basket’ of precious metals includes gold, silver, platinum and palladium.

We believe that a precious metals basket is an attractive alternative to holding a broad based commodity benchmark
The precious metals basket has a history of outperforming the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) and S&P 500 Index


A precious metals basket is a potential attractive addition to most portfolios compared to traditional broad commodity exposure. ETF Securities is the only U.S. firm to offer a basket of precious metals in an ETF wrapper.

Proceeds received by the Trust from the issuance and sale of Baskets,including 
the Seed Baskets and the Shares (which are described on the front page of this 
prospectus), will consist of gold, silver, platinum and palladium deposits. 
Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, during the life of the Trust such proceeds 
will only be (1) held by the Trust, (2) distributed to Authorized Participants 
in connection with the redemption of Baskets or (3) disbursed to pay the
Sponsor’s Fee or sold as needed to pay the Trust’s expenses not assumed by 
the Sponsor.


The Trust will compete with other financial vehicles, including traditional 
debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold, silver, platinum 
and palladium industries and other securities backed by or linked to Bullion, 
direct investments in Bullion and investment vehicles similar to the Trust. 
Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor’s 
control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or 
to invest in Bullion directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and
reduce the liquidity of the Shares.


Company Description
The Trust is a common law trust, formed on October 18, 2010 under New York law
pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust holds Bullion and is expected from
time to time to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of Bullion and to 
distribute Bullion in connection with redemptions of Baskets. The


 investment 
objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the 
prices of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium, in the proportions 
held by the Trust, less the Trust’s expenses. The Sponsor believes that, for 
many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective investment in 
Bullion. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest 
in and ownership of the Trust and are expected to be traded under the ticker 
symbol “GLTR” on the NYSE Arca.

The Trust’s Sponsor is ETF Securities USA LLC. The Sponsor is a Delaware 
limited liability company formed on June 17, 2009, and is wholly-owned by
ETF Securities Limited. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act 
and the governing documents of the Sponsor, ETF Securities Limited, the sole
member of the Sponsor, is not responsible for the debts, obligations and 
liabilities of the Sponsor solely by reason of being the sole member of the 
Sponsor.

The Sponsor will arrange for the creation of the Trust, the registration of 
the Shares for their public offering in the United States and the listing of 
the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following 
administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee’s 
monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian’s fee and expenses 
reimbursable under the Custody Agreements, exchange listing fees, SEC 
registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 
per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor will also pay the costs of the 
Trust’s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the 
applicable SEC registration fees.

The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon. The Trustee is generally 
responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust. This includes (1) 
transferring the Trust’s Bullion as needed to pay the Sponsor’s fee in 
Bullion (Bullion transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in 
the ordinary course), (2) calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per 
Share, (3) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to 
create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with 
the Custodian and The Depository Trust Company (DTC) and (4) selling the 
Trust’s Bullion as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are 
not assumed by the Sponsor. 

The Custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Custodian is responsible for 
the safekeeping of the Trust’s Bullion deposited with it by Authorized 
Participants in connection with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian also
facilitates the transfer of Bullion in and out of the Trust through Bullion 
accounts it will maintain for Authorized Participants and the Trust. The 
Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher of gold and silver 
under the rules of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and of 
platinum and palladium under the rules of the London Platinum and Palladium 
Market (LPPM). The Custodian will hold the Trust’s loco London allocated 
Bullion in its London, England vaulting premises on a segregated basis and
may select one or more Zurich Sub-Custodians to hold the Trust’s loco Zurich 
allocated platinum and palladium on the Custodian’s behalf at any such Zurich 
Sub-Custodian’s Zurich, Switzerland vaulting premises on a segregated basis.

Trust Overview 

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the 
performance of the price of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium in 
the proportions held by the Trust, less the expenses of the Trust’s 
operations. The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective 
and convenient way to invest in a basket of Bullion with minimal credit 
risk. 

The Trust is one of several exchange-traded products that seek to track the 
price of physical precious metals (“Bullion ETPs”). Some of the distinguishing 
features of the Trust and its Shares include holding of physical gold, silver, 
platinum and palladium bullion in the specified ratio, vaulting of Trust gold 
and silver in London and the vaulting of Trust platinum and palladium in 
London or Zurich, the experience of the Sponsor’s management team, the use of 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA as Custodian, third-party vault inspection and the 
allocation of almost all of the Trust’s Bullion. 

Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, 
including price volatility

New York 10005. The Sponsor’s office is located at ETF Securities,
