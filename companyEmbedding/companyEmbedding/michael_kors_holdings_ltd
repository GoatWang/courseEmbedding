                                         said it sees the opportunity to grow Jimmy Choo into a $1 billion brand, better position itself in the luxury footwear space, and expand in luxury accessories. Michael Kors also has its eye on men’s footwear, saying in the deal announcement that Jimmy Choo is “adding a twist to classic shapes” in men’s evening shoes. “Women’s shoes are at the heart of this leading fashion luxury house complemented by accessories,” said Michael Kors Chief Executive John Idol, according to a FactSet transcript of the acquisition call Tuesday morning. “In addition, the company has built a significant credibility in men’s footwear with an assortment that extends from evening to active styles.” Retail sales of men’s designer footwear have grown faster than women’s designer shoes over the last three years, according to data provided by Euromonitor International, a market research provider. Still, women’s luxury footwear is the bigger market, generating $17.7 billion in 2016. Men’s luxury shoes generated $9.6 billion in global retail sales last year. According to Pedro Aguilar, personal accessories analyst at Euromonitor International, “that disparity is unlikely to narrow significantly over the next decade.” More broadly, the purchase is a way for Michael Kors to maintain its luxury status. The company is pulling back from the wholesale channel to better control discounting and merchandise availability, both threats to brand health.

Shares will continue to face hurdles from competition and industry trends, and this sale will weigh on sales and margins in the near term.

But while Coach and Kate Space have qualities in common, the same cannot be said for Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.  See also: Kate Spade acquisition will add millennial shoppers to Coach customer base  “[W]hile there was a natural synergy between the Coach and Kate Spade brands, with similar audiences and price points (not to mention potential to integrate operations and efficiencies), Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo sit quite separately in both price and audience, as well as distinctive approaches to production,” said Couttigane. “One is relatively mass produced and affordable, the other more conservative in production, embracing more handcraftsmanship and carrying a much higher premium as a result.” Michael Kors’ Idol called Jimmy Choo “a natural fit for our group” on the Tuesday call. Still, he said the companies are “going to operate very independently, and where we can find synergies that [are] related to more of back-end functions is probably where you would see some of that ultimately play out.” Michael Kors shares are down 17% for the year so far.

      globally. We believe that Jimmy Choo is poised for meaningful growth in 
      the future and our company is committed to supporting the strong brand 
      equity that Jimmy Choo has built over the last 20 years.”
    

      Mr. Idol continued, “Pierre Denis will continue in his role as Chief 
      Executive Officer of Jimmy Choo. He has led the company since 2012, 
      during which time Jimmy Choo experienced compounded sales growth of 11% 
      annually. Pierre brings more than 25 years of experience and a strong 
      track record with global fashion luxury brands. Additionally, Creative 
      Director Sandra Choi will continue to lead the creative and design teams 
      at the company. Sandra has been with Jimmy Choo since its inception and 
      has been the sole Creative Director since 2013. Her groundbreaking 
      vision and fashion artistry have created a truly iconic and 
      internationally recognized luxury brand. Mr. Denis, Ms. Choi and the 
      rest of the highly-talented management team have done a tremendous job, 
      and this continuity of leadership will ensure that the DNA of Jimmy Choo 
      is maintained as we work together to continue to grow the brand 
      globally.”
    

      Michael Kors, Honorary Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Michael 
      Kors, said, “Jimmy Choo is a premier fashion luxury house that offers 
      distinctive footwear, handbags and other accessories. We admire the 
      glamorous style and trendsetting nature of Jimmy Choo designs. We look 
      forward to welcoming Jimmy Choo to our luxury group.”
    

      Pierre Denis, Chief Executive Officer of Jimmy Choo, said, “It is a 
      privilege for our management team to lead Jimmy Choo and to preside over 
      such an exciting period for our company. We are convinced that there is 
      so much more that can be delivered in the years ahead. We look forward 
      to working closely with the leadership and team at Michael Kors Holdings 
      Limited to further develop our iconic brand. Our two companies share the 
      same vision of style and trend leadership. Our luxury heritage is the 
      foundation of Jimmy Choo and we will continue to bring our brand vision 
      to consumers globally.”
    

Iconic and Powerful Luxury Brand


      Jimmy Choo is a luxury accessories brand that offers an empowered sense 
      of glamour and a playfully daring spirit. Since its inception in 1996, 
      the company has offered distinctive, glamorous and fashion-forward 
      products, with luxury footwear at the heart of its unique brand DNA. The 
      brand began as a bespoke atelier that catered to the global luxury 
      consumer, and continues to be popular with style icons around the globe, 
      including celebrities, royalty, musicians and heads of state. Jimmy Choo 
      offers exceptionally crafted products of the highest quality, with a 
      design team that is at the forefront of interpreting fashion trends in 
      footwear and accessories. The collections reflect a mix of iconic, 
      timeless products that appeals to a broader audience, as well as 
      innovative offerings that are targeted to fashion trendsetters globally.
    

      With approximately 150 company-operated retail stores, 560 multi-brand 
      doors and more than 60 franchise stores in premier locations worldwide, 
      Jimmy Choo has a successful, balanced distribution network. The company 
      has a strong presence in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Asia. 
      In addition, Jimmy Choo continues to invest significantly in its online 
      platform, which has experienced strong revenue growth in recent years.
    

      The company also continues to build its presence in accessories and 
      men’s footwear. The brand has a natural authority in men’s evening 
      shoes, adding a twist to classic shapes, and has also seen strong growth 
      in luxury active footwear. By integrating a dual gender product 
      portfolio into its retail stores, Jimmy Choo expects to unlock 
      additional value from this fast growing segment of the business.
    

Strategic Rationale


      The acquisition of Jimmy Choo is expected to deliver a number of 
      benefits, including:
    


        The opportunity to grow Jimmy Choo sales to $1 billion
      

        A more balanced portfolio with greater product diversification
      

        An enhanced positioning in the attractive and growing luxury footwear 
        segment
      

        The opportunity to grow in the men’s luxury footwear category
      

        Further expansion in the luxury accessories market
      

        Greater exposure to global markets, particularly the fast-growing 
        market in Asia

      of the acquisition on Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, the expected timing 
      and scope of the acquisition and other statements other than historical 
      facts. All statements other than statements of historical facts included 
      in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Without 
      limitation, any statements preceded or followed by or that include the 
      words “targets”, “plans”, “believes”, “expects”, “aims”, “intends”, 
      “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “may”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, 
      “synergy”, “cost-saving”, “projects”, “goal”, “strategy”, “budget”, 
      “forecast” or “might” or, words or terms of similar substance or the 
      negative thereof, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking 
      statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future 
      capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, economic 
      performance, indebtedness, financial condition, dividend policy, losses 
      and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the 
      expansion and growth of Jimmy Choo’s and Michael Kors’ operations and 
      benefits from the acquisition; and (iii) the effects of government 
      regulation on Michael Kors’ or Jimmy Choo’s business. These 
      forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future financial 
      performance. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown 
      risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results 
      and are based on certain key assumptions. Many risks, uncertainties and 
      other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      projected or implied in any forward-looking statements. These risks, 
      uncertainties and other factors include the satisfaction of the 
      conditions to consummating the acquisition, Michael Kors’ ability to 
      integrate the businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated 
      benefits of the acquisition; the risk of disruptions to Michael Kors’ or 
      Jimmy Choo’s businesses; the negative effects of the announcement of the 
      proposed acquisition or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on 
      the market price of the Michael Kors’ ordinary shares and its operating 
      results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of 
      litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed 
      acquisition; fluctuations in demand for Jimmy Choo’s and Michael Kors’ 
      products; changes in consumer traffic and retail trends; loss of market 
      share and industry competition; fluctuations in the capital markets; 
      fluctuations in interest and exchange rates; the occurrence of 
      unforeseen disasters or catastrophes; political or economic instability 
      in principal markets; adverse outcomes in litigation; and general, local 
      and global economic, political, business and market conditions, as well 
      as those risks set forth in the reports that Michael Kors files from 
      time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Other 
      unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such 
      forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of 
      such factors. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, neither 
      Michael Kors nor Jimmy Choo, nor any of their respective associates or 
      directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance 
      or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in 
      any forward-looking statements in this press release will actually 
      occur. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to 
      place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. All subsequent 
      oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to Michael Kors 
      or Jimmy Choo or any of their respective members, directors, officers or 
      employees or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified 
      in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Michael Kors and 
      Jimmy Choo disclaim any obligation to update or revise any 
      forward-looking or other statements contained herein other than 
      in accordance with their legal and regulatory obligations.
    

Important information


      This press release is for information purposes only and is not intended 
      to, and does not, constitute or form part of an offer to purchase or the 
      solicitation of an offer to sell any securities or the solicitation of 
      any vote or approval in any jurisdiction pursuant to the Scheme or 
      otherwise. The proposed acquisition will be implemented solely pursuant 
      to the terms of a Scheme Document, which will contain the full terms and 
      conditions of the proposed acquisition. Any decision in respect of, or 
      other response to, the proposed acquisition should be made only on the 
      basis of the information contained in the Scheme Document.
    

Additional information for US shareholders


      The proposed acquisition relates to the shares of an English company and 
      is expected to be made by means of a scheme of arrangement provided for 
      under English company law. The proposed acquisition will not be subject 
      to the tender offer rules or the proxy solicitation rules under the U.S. 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “US Exchange Act”). 
      Accordingly, the proposed acquisition will be subject to the disclosure 
      requirements and practices applicable in the United Kingdom to schemes 
      of arrangement, which differ from the disclosure requirements of U.S. 
      tender offer and proxy solicitation rules. If, in the future, Michael 
      Kors exercises the right to implement the proposed acquisition by way of 
      a takeover offer, the proposed acquisition will be made in compliance 
      with applicable U.S. laws and regulations, including Section 14(e) of 
      the US Exchange Act and Regulation 14E thereunder.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
