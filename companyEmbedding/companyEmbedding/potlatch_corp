History[edit]
The Potlatch Lumber Company was incorporated in 1903. It planned a lumber mill on the Palouse River and began construction in 1905, completed in 1906. The mill operated until 1981. The company town of Potlatch, Idaho was built to serve the mill. Over 200 buildings were designed by architect C. Ferris White for the firm. The town soon became the second biggest town in Latah County, Idaho, and the firm was the biggest taxpayer in the state of Idaho for some years.[3]:8-9
The Commercial Historic District (Potlatch, Idaho), which includes the main administrative building of the company, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[4]
In 2002, Potlatch sold its Cloquet, Minnesota, pulp and printing papers facilities and associated assets to Sappi Limited for US$480 million. This sale marked its exit from the coated printing papers business.
In 2006, Potlatch restructured to form a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this restructuring all of the company's manufacturing operations are held by a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing the company to refocus on managing their large land holdings in Oregon, Idaho, Minnesota, and Arkansas.
Properties[edit]
The company owns about 1,600,000 acres (6,500 km2) of land in rural Minnesota, Idaho, Wisconsin and Arkansas. The forestry products that it sells are processed at six company-owned facilities.[5]
Spin-off of Clearwater Paper Corporation[edit]
On December 9, 2008, Clearwater Paper Corporation, previously a subsidiary of Potlatch, was created via a spin-off, with Gordon L. Jones, a vice-president of Potlatch, as the new company's president and CEO.
Shares of Clearwater Paper (NYSE:CLW) stock were distributed to Potlatch share holders at a ratio of 1 share of Clearwater stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock held, with any fractional shares being paid in cash. Clearwater stocks began trading on December 16, 2008.
In August 2012, since Clearwater Paper's stocks have failed to rise, the company prepared to split in two and sell one or both businesses.[6]
Annual financial information (2001-2009)[edit]
Part of the reason for the large fall in revenue after 2005 is due to the divestiture of assets such as Clearwater Paper.

History[edit]
The Potlatch Lumber Company was incorporated in 1903. It planned a lumber mill on the Palouse River and began construction in 1905, completed in 1906. The mill operated until 1981. The company town of Potlatch, Idaho was built to serve the mill. Over 200 buildings were designed by architect C. Ferris White for the firm. The town soon became the second biggest town in Latah County, Idaho, and the firm was the biggest taxpayer in the state of Idaho for some years.[3]:8-9
The Commercial Historic District (Potlatch, Idaho), which includes the main administrative building of the company, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[4]
In 2002, Potlatch sold its Cloquet, Minnesota, pulp and printing papers facilities and associated assets to Sappi Limited for US$480 million. This sale marked its exit from the coated printing papers business.
In 2006, Potlatch restructured to form a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this restructuring all of the company's manufacturing operations are held by a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing the company to refocus on managing their large land holdings in Oregon, Idaho, Minnesota, and Arkansas.
Properties[edit]
The company owns about 1,600,000 acres (6,500 km2) of land in rural Minnesota, Idaho, Wisconsin and Arkansas. The forestry products that it sells are processed at six company-owned facilities.[5]
Spin-off of Clearwater Paper Corporation[edit]
On December 9, 2008, Clearwater Paper Corporation, previously a subsidiary of Potlatch, was created via a spin-off, with Gordon L. Jones, a vice-president of Potlatch, as the new company's president and CEO.
Shares of Clearwater Paper (NYSE:CLW) stock were distributed to Potlatch share holders at a ratio of 1 share of Clearwater stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock held, with any fractional shares being paid in cash. Clearwater stocks began trading on December 16, 2008.
In August 2012, since Clearwater Paper's stocks have failed to rise, the company prepared to split in two and sell one or both businesses.[6]

Part of the reason for the large fall in revenue after 2005 is due to the divestiture of assets such as Clearwater Paper.

History[edit]
The Potlatch Lumber Company was incorporated in 1903. It planned a lumber mill on the Palouse River and began construction in 1905, completed in 1906. The mill operated until 1981. The company town of Potlatch, Idaho was built to serve the mill. Over 200 buildings were designed by architect C. Ferris White for the firm. The town soon became the second biggest town in Latah County, Idaho, and the firm was the biggest taxpayer in the state of Idaho for some years.[3]:8-9
The Commercial Historic District (Potlatch, Idaho), which includes the main administrative building of the company, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[4]
In 2002, Potlatch sold its Cloquet, Minnesota, pulp and printing papers facilities and associated assets to Sappi Limited for US$480 million. This sale marked its exit from the coated printing papers business.
In 2006, Potlatch restructured to form a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this restructuring all of the company's manufacturing operations are held by a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing the company to refocus on managing their large land holdings in Oregon, Idaho, Minnesota, and Arkansas.
Properties[edit]
The company owns about 1,600,000 acres (6,500 km2) of land in rural Minnesota, Idaho, Wisconsin and Arkansas. The forestry products that it sells are processed at six company-owned facilities.[5]
Spin-off of Clearwater Paper Corporation[edit]
On December 9, 2008, Clearwater Paper Corporation, previously a subsidiary of Potlatch, was created via a spin-off, with Gordon L. Jones, a vice-president of Potlatch, as the new company's president and CEO.
Shares of Clearwater Paper (NYSE:CLW) stock were distributed to Potlatch share holders at a ratio of 1 share of Clearwater stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock held, with any fractional shares being paid in cash. Clearwater stocks began trading on December 16, 2008.
In August 2012, since Clearwater Paper's stocks have failed to rise, the company prepared to split in two and sell one or both businesses.[6]
Annual financial information (2001-2009)[edit]
Part of the reason for the large fall in revenue after 2005 is due to the divestiture of assets such as Clearwater Paper.

History[edit]
The Potlatch Lumber Company was incorporated in 1903. It planned a lumber mill on the Palouse River and began construction in 1905, completed in 1906. The mill operated until 1981. The company town of Potlatch, Idaho was built to serve the mill. Over 200 buildings were designed by architect C. Ferris White for the firm. The town soon became the second biggest town in Latah County, Idaho, and the firm was the biggest taxpayer in the state of Idaho for some years.[3]:8-9
The Commercial Historic District (Potlatch, Idaho), which includes the main administrative building of the company, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[4]
In 2002, Potlatch sold its Cloquet, Minnesota, pulp and printing papers facilities and associated assets to Sappi Limited for US$480 million. This sale marked its exit from the coated printing papers business.
In 2006, Potlatch restructured to form a real estate investment trust (REIT). In this restructuring all of the company's manufacturing operations are held by a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing the company to refocus on managing their large land holdings in Oregon, Idaho, Minnesota, and Arkansas.
Properties[edit]
The company owns about 1,600,000 acres (6,500 km2) of land in rural Minnesota, Idaho, Wisconsin and Arkansas. The forestry products that it sells are processed at six company-owned facilities.[5]
Spin-off of Clearwater Paper Corporation[edit]
On December 9, 2008, Clearwater Paper Corporation, previously a subsidiary of Potlatch, was created via a spin-off, with Gordon L. Jones, a vice-president of Potlatch, as the new company's president and CEO.
Shares of Clearwater Paper (NYSE:CLW) stock were distributed to Potlatch share holders at a ratio of 1 share of Clearwater stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock held, with any fractional shares being paid in cash. Clearwater stocks began trading on December 16, 2008.
In August 2012, since Clearwater Paper's stocks have failed to rise, the company prepared to split in two and sell one or both businesses.[6]
Annual financial information (2001-2009)[edit]
Part of the reason for the large fall in revenue after 2005 is due to the divestiture of assets such as Clearwater Paper.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
