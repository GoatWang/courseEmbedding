Reliability and Failure Analysis

ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. ("ChipMOS"), listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Market in April, 2014 (TWSE: 8150), is a leading independent provider of total semiconductor testing and packaging solutions to fabless companies, integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundries. ChipMOS merged with its parent company, ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Bermuda) Limited in October, 2016.  Consideration of the merger was the combination of cash and newly-issued American Depository Shares (ADS) trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market with ticker of “IMOS”.
We provide a full range of back-end testing services for high density memory, mixed-signal and flat panel display (FPD) driver semiconductors. In addition, we offer a comprehensive selection of leadframe-based and organic substrate-based package assembly services for memory, mixed-signal, and FPD driver semiconductors which are used in diverse end-use markets, including personal computers, communications equipment, office automation and consumer electronics. Our testing and packaging services are provided, pursuant to customer’s request, on a independent or  a turnkey basis.
With operations headquartered in Taiwan, the heart of the world’s technology value chain, most testing is currently conducted at our facility in the Hsinchu Science Park, while semiconductor packaging services are primarily conducted at our Southern Taiwan Science Park facility. We also provide gold bumping services at Chupei, Hsinchu. All of our facilities are state-of-the-art and reflect our long-standing commitment to our customers with the best technology and support services leading, innovative customers deserve.
In addition to our unique back-end solutions, we work in collaboration with our global client base to provide a complete range of vertically integrated solutions from package design through drop-shipment. This total solution capability is critical given compressed product lifecycles and the need for streamlined, efficient supply chain partners.
Close collaboration between our R&D teams and customers ensures technology roadmaps synchronized with production readiness of new test and package solutions for increasingly sophisticated semiconductor products. Growing with our customers leverages and expands our deployment of advanced engineering skills and capabilities for ongoing cost reductions, such as software conversion programs and parallel testing for client testing operations.

	ChipMOS BERMUDA AND ChipMOS TAIWAN AGREE TO MERGE; ChipMOS BERMUDA HOLDERS TO RECEIVE US$19.77 IN CASH AND
	STOCK FOR EACH ChipMOS BERMUDA COMMON SHARE




	Hsinchu, Taiwan January 21, 2016

	- ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Bermuda) LTD. (ChipMOS
	or the Company) (Nasdaq: IMOS), an industry leading provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test services (OSAT), today announced that both the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of
	its 58.3% owned subsidiary ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (ChipMOS Taiwan, Taiwan Stock Exchange: 8150) have approved the merger of ChipMOS with and into ChipMOS Taiwan, with ChipMOS Taiwan becoming the surviving company. Under the agreement,
	ChipMOS shareholders will receive US$3.71 in cash, without interest, and 0.9355 American Depository Shares (ADS) representing 18.71 shares of ChipMOS Taiwan (each ADS will represent 20 new common shares, par value of NT$10 each, to be
	issued by ChipMOS Taiwan) in exchange for each ChipMOS common share of par value US$0.04 currently held. This would represent US$19.77 in total consideration as of January 20, 2016 and a premium of 14.7% based on the average closing prices of
	ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan on the Nasdaq and the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the 3 trading days ending January 20, 2016 and an exchange rate of NT$33.785 to US$1.0. The merger is consistent with the ongoing efforts to simplify and streamline the
	group structure, reduce operating costs in order to enhance operation efficiency, and achieve a more efficient tax structure. ChipMOS Taiwans Board of Directors has also approved the establishment of a new U.S. American Depositary Receipt
	program to facilitate the merger and to foster ongoing market liquidity of its shares. An application will be submitted for the listing of the new ADSs on the NASDAQ, and the issuance of approximately 510,595 thousand common shares which will
	be represented by the new ADSs to be issued as part of the consideration for the merger with ChipMOS.


	On closing of the merger, all common shares of
	ChipMOS and shares of ChipMOS Taiwan currently held by ChipMOS will be cancelled.


	ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan executed the agreement and plan of merger
	after the respective meetings of their Boards of Directors. The listing of the new ADSs and the merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholders approvals from ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan, and approvals from
	appropriate governmental authorities and regulators and the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (1981) of Bermuda (as amended), the ROC Business Merger and Acquisitions Act, as amended and other applicable laws, if any. The merger is
	currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, contingent on satisfaction of above approvals and other conditions, which will be outlined in the Registration Statement on Form F-4 that ChipMOS Taiwan will file with the U.S. Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the U.S. SEC).



	Ownership Structure:



	 


	 





	Note: * SPIL ownership in ChipMOS Taiwan post merger is 17.6% aggregately, including 15.0% in common shares and 2.6% via
	ADSs.





	Well Fargo Securities, LLC is acting as financial advisor to the special committee of ChipMOS. Cooley LLP is
	serving as legal counsel to the special committee of ChipMOS. K&L Gates LLP, Appleby Global Group Services Limited, and Johnson and Partners are serving as U.S., Bermuda and Taiwan corporate counsels to ChipMOS, respectively.


	Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Limited is acting as financial adviser to ChipMOS Taiwan. Davis Polk & Wardwell is serving as U.S. counsel, Lee and Li is
	serving as Taiwan counsel, and Conyers Dill & Pearman is serving as Bermuda counsel to ChipMOS Taiwan.


	The proposed corporate
	restructuring is an important milestone for us, said S.J. Cheng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan. The completion of the merger will allow us to more efficiently operate as a singular entity and brand,
	placing ChipMOS in an even stronger position for future growth and development.



	This press release is not an offering of securities for sale in
	any jurisdiction:



	ChipMOS Taiwan will file a registration statement on Form F-4 with the U.S. SEC in connection with the merger. The Form F-4 will
	contain a prospectus, proxy statement for the merger and other documents. In addition, certain participants in the merger will prepare and file with the U.S. SEC a Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement. These documents will contain important
	information about ChipMOS Taiwan and ChipMOS, the merger and related matters, including the terms and conditions of the transaction. Shareholders of ChipMOS are urged to carefully read these documents, as they may be amended from time to time,
	before making any decision with respect to the merger. The Form F-4, prospectus, proxy statement, Schedule 13E-3 and all other documents filed with the U.S. SEC in connection with the merger will be available when filed, free of charge, on the U.S.
	SECs website at

	www.sec.gov

	and in the SEC section of the ChipMOS Investor Relations website at www.chipmos.com. In addition, these documents will be made available, free of charge, to shareholders of ChipMOS who make a written request
	to

	irene_tsai@chipmos.com

	.

	receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(f), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.04, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, the Share

	application of Section 2.09 to any fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADS to which any holder of IMOS Shares would otherwise be entitled to.




	(b) The parties agree and acknowledge that the Merger Consideration is based on the respective reviewed financial statements of ChipMOS Taiwan
	and IMOS as of September 30, 2015, considering the factors of operating results, financial status, market price of IMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan stock, and the prospects of both companies.


	Section 2.04

	. Surrender and Payment.

	(a) Prior to the Effective Time, ChipMOS Taiwan shall appoint Citibank N.A., or any
	other reputable U.S. national bank reasonably acceptable to the parties, to act as agent of ChipMOS Taiwan (the 

	Exchange Agent

	Shares (the 

	Certificates

	) or (ii) uncertificated IMOS Shares (the 

	Uncertificated Shares

	). At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, ChipMOS Taiwan shall (A) deposit, or cause to be
	deposited with the Depositary Bank (or a custodian designated by the Depositary Bank), a number of ChipMOS Taiwan Shares equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs to be issued as Share Consideration, multiplied by
	(y) the ADS Shares Number, and (B) deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the IMOS Shareholders, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04, through the Exchange Agent, (x) immediately available funds sufficient to
	pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.03, together with any cash in lieu of fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs pursuant to Section 2.09, and (y) the receipts (or uncertificated book-entries, as applicable) representing

	Shareholders, the ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs evidencing such ChipMOS Taiwan Shares in accordance with this Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time, ChipMOS Taiwan shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Certificates
	representing IMOS Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
	Agent) for use in the surrender of Certificates for the Merger Consideration.


	 


	10







	(b) Each holder of IMOS Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
	Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of the IMOS Shares (A) the number of whole ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, after
	taking into account all the IMOS Shares then held by such holder, and (B) a check for the full amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, including the Cash Consideration, cash in lieu
	of fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs, certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.04(f), in each case less any required withholding of Taxes. Holders of IMOS Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to take any
	actions to surrender their IMOS Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent (such holders shall be deemed to have surrendered their IMOS Shares to the Exchange Agent immediately after the Effective Time). Holders of IMOS Certificated Shares shall be
	required to surrender the Certificates representing such IMOS Shares to the Exchange Agent with a duly completed and signed letter of transmittal in order to receive the Merger Consideration and applicable dividends or other distributions under
	Section 2.04(f). Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered or transferred will forthwith be canceled. ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs shall be accepted into The Depository Trust Company (

	DTC

	) and issued in uncertificated book-entry
	form to such account as shall be specified by the DTC, unless a physical ADR is requested or otherwise required by Applicable Law, in which case ChipMOS Taiwan shall cause the Exchange Agent to send an ADR representing such ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs to
	DTC. ChipMOS Taiwan shall cause the Exchange Agent to coordinate the exchange of IMOS Shares for the Merger Consideration promptly after the Effective Time, and issue to holders of Uncertificated Shares (x) a statement evidencing the issuance
	of the applicable ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs under the name of such holder and (y) a check for the applicable Cash Consideration and for any applicable cash-in-lieu payment. Until surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
	or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(f). No interest will be paid
	or will accrue on any Merger Consideration or unpaid dividends and other distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Article 2.




	(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
	registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be accompanied by a duly executed instrument of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
	payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
	that such tax has been paid or is not payable.


	 


	11





	(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of IMOS Shares.
	If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
	set forth, in this Article 2.


	(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
	2.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of IMOS Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to ChipMOS Taiwan, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged IMOS Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
	this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to ChipMOS Taiwan for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.04(f), in respect of such shares without any
	interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ChipMOS Taiwan shall not be liable to any holder of IMOS Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
	unclaimed by holders of IMOS Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent
	permitted by Applicable Law, the property of ChipMOS Taiwan free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a)
	for IMOS Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to ChipMOS Taiwan upon demand.


	(f) No dividends or other
	distributions with respect to ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs as provided in Section 2.09, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not
	surrendered until such Certificates are surrendered, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.04. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Certificates have been registered,
	(i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional ChipMOS ADSs to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09 and the amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
	Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and
	prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.


	Section 2.05.

	IMOS Dissenting Holders

	. At the Effective Time, any IMOS Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled, and unless otherwise
	required by Applicable Law, be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive, and any holder of IMOS Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of an IMOS Dissenting Share as appraised
	by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the 

	IMOS Appraised Fair Value

	) is greater than the Merger Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference from IMOS if such appraisal is
	made before the Effective Time (and from the Surviving Company if such appraisal is made on or after the Effective Time) by payment made within thirty (30) days after such IMOS Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such
	appraisal procedure. In the event that a IMOS Dissenting Shareholder fails to exercise, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal such holders IMOS Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and converted as of the Effective
	Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such IMOS Dissenting Share. IMOS shall provide ChipMOS Taiwan, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, with the opportunity to participate with IMOS in, and to be regularly
	consulted by IMOS with respect to, any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any written demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act.

	Section 2.06.

	ChipMOS Taiwan Dissenting Holders

	. Within 20 days after the date of the
	ChipMOS Taiwan Shareholder Approval, any ChipMOS Taiwan Dissenting Holder may exercise its appraisal right to require ChipMOS Taiwan to purchase its ChipMOS Taiwan Dissenting Shares, pursuant to and in accordance with Article 12 of the ROC Business
	M&A Act and other Applicable Laws. All ChipMOS Taiwan Dissenting Shares purchased by ChipMOS Taiwan pursuant to this Section 2.06 may be transferred to the Exchange Agent, cancelled or otherwise sold pursuant to Article 13 of the ROC Business
	M&A Act.


	Section 2.07

	. Treatment of IMOS Equity Awards.

	(a) At the Effective Time, IMOS shall terminate the IMOS
	Share Plans, and:


	(i) each outstanding IMOS Share Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with
	the terms of the applicable grant or award agreement and IMOS Share Plan and, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest
	thereon, equal to the product of (x) the total number of IMOS Shares subject to such IMOS Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Value over the exercise price per IMOS Share of
	such cancelled IMOS Share Option, less applicable withholding taxes (such excess amounts payable hereunder, the 

	IMOS Option Payments

	). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the product obtained by such calculation with
	respect to a IMOS Share Option is zero or a negative number than such IMOS Share Option shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled without consideration and such IMOS Share Option shall have no further force or effect; and


	(ii) each outstanding IMOS SAR, whether vested or unvested, shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable
	grant or award agreement and IMOS Share Plan and, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the product
	of (x) the total number of IMOS Shares subject to such IMOS SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Value over the exercise price per IMOS Share of such cancelled IMOS SAR, less applicable
	withholding taxes (such amounts payable hereunder, the 

	IMOS SAR Payments

	 and together with the IMOS Option Payments, the 

	IMOS Equity Award Payments

	). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the product
	obtained by such calculation with respect to an IMOS SAR is zero or a negative number than such IMOS SAR shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled without consideration and such IMOS SAR shall have no further force or effect.


	 


	13





	(b) IMOS shall pay, or, to the extent not paid by IMOS prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
	Company shall pay to each former holder of any IMOS Share Option or IMOS SAR outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, as promptly as practicable, but no later than the next regularly scheduled employee payroll date in the jurisdiction of
	such Person, after the Effective Time, the amount of IMOS Equity Award Payments payable to such Person holder pursuant to Section 2.07(a).


	(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the IMOS Board shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.07.


	Section 2.08

	. Adjustments.

	If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
	outstanding share capital of IMOS or ChipMOS Taiwan shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
	such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase IMOS Shares granted under IMOS stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration, the
	Exchange Ratio and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted, for which neither party is required to hold a shareholders meeting.


	Section 2.09

	. Fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs.

	No fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional
	ChipMOS Taiwan ADSs that any holder of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional ChipMOS Taiwan ADS results from such aggregation, such holder shall
	be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing price for a ChipMOS Taiwan Share on the TSEC on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time, in US$ based on the average
	closing NT$:US$ buying cash rate published by the Bank of Taiwan for such date, by the product of the fraction of a ChipMOS Taiwan ADS to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled, multiplied by the ADS Shares Number, which shall be
	distributed to such holder by the Exchange Agent with the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.04.


	Section 2.10

	.
	Withholding Rights.

	Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company and ChipMOS Taiwan shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
	Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company or
	ChipMOS Taiwan, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the IMOS Shares in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company or ChipMOS
	Taiwan, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding and provide the evidence of such deduction and withholding to the holders of the IMOS Shares.

	Section 2.11

	. Lost Certificates.

	If any Certificate shall have been lost,
	stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
	the Surviving Company may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
	paid in respect of the IMOS Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

	Matching
	Period

	) (x) the IMOS Board shall have provided the ChipMOS Taiwan Board with a reasonable opportunity to make any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Transactions so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases
	to be a Superior Proposal and shall negotiate with ChipMOS Taiwan in good faith with respect thereto, and (y) the IMOS Board shall have determined in good faith at the end of such Matching Period and, after considering the results of such
	negotiations and the revised proposals made by ChipMOS Taiwan, if any, and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the Superior Proposal, giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice, continues to be a Superior
	Proposal and that the failure to make such a Change of Recommendation could violate its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws, and (C) the IMOS Board has not materially breached its obligations under this Section 6.03.


	 


	25





	(e) Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation or anything else contained in this Agreement:
	(i) IMOS shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the IMOS Shareholder Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the IMOS Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall relieve IMOS of such obligation, and such obligation shall not be

	(g) From and after the date of this Agreement, IMOS shall promptly orally notify ChipMOS Taiwan of any request for information or any
	inquiries, proposals or offers relating to an Acquisition Proposal indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person making such request, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers

	Taiwan written notice of any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 24 hours of such event and copies of any written or electronic correspondence to or from any Person making an Acquisition Proposal. IMOS shall keep ChipMOS Taiwan informed orally,

	Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
	Applicable Laws, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
	advisable on their part to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
	non-actions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all other necessary registrations and filings, including the Transaction Approvals and (ii) the obtaining of
	all consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties that are necessary or desirable or required in connection with the Transactions.

	party shall permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
	other Person, and to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in those meetings and conferences, in each case in connection with the transactions
	contemplated by this Agreement.


	Section 8.03.

	before issuing any press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this
	Agreement or the Transactions and, except in respect of any public statement or press release as may be required by Applicable Law or any requirements of the TSEC or the NASDAQ, in which circumstance reasonable efforts to consult with the other
	party will be required to the extent practicable, shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call without the consent of the other party.

	and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest thereon, equal to the product of (x) the total number of IMOS Shares subject to such
	IMOS SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Value over the exercise price per IMOS Share of such cancelled IMOS SAR, less applicable withholding taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event

HSINCHU, Taiwan, Jan. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Bermuda) LTD. ("ChipMOS" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:   IMOS), an industry leading provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test services ("OSAT"), today announced that both the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of its 58.3% owned subsidiary ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. ("ChipMOS Taiwan", Taiwan Stock Exchange: 8150) have approved the merger of ChipMOS with and into ChipMOS Taiwan, with ChipMOS Taiwan becoming the surviving company.  Under the agreement, ChipMOS shareholders will receive US$3.71 in cash, without interest, and 0.9355 American Depository Shares ("ADS") representing 18.71 shares of ChipMOS Taiwan (each ADS will represent 20 new common shares, par value of NT$10 each, to be issued by ChipMOS Taiwan) in exchange for each ChipMOS common share of par value US$0.04 currently held.  This would represent US$19.77 in total consideration as of January 20, 2016 and a premium of 14.7% based on the average closing prices of ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan on the Nasdaq and the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the 3 trading days ending January 20, 2016 and an exchange rate of NT$33.785 to US$1.0. The merger is consistent with the ongoing efforts to simplify and streamline the group structure, reduce operating costs in order to enhance operation efficiency, and achieve a more efficient tax structure. ChipMOS Taiwan's Board of Directors has also approved the establishment of a new U.S. American Depositary Receipt program to facilitate the merger and to foster ongoing market liquidity of its shares.  An application will be submitted for the listing of the new ADSs on the NASDAQ, and the issuance of approximately 510,595 thousand common shares which will be represented by the new ADSs to be issued as part of the consideration for the merger with ChipMOS.  
On closing of the merger, all common shares of ChipMOS and shares of ChipMOS Taiwan currently held by ChipMOS will be cancelled. 
ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan executed the agreement and plan of merger after the respective meetings of their Boards of Directors. The listing of the new ADSs and the merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including shareholders' approvals from ChipMOS and ChipMOS Taiwan, and approvals from appropriate governmental authorities and regulators and the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (1981) of Bermuda (as amended), the ROC Business Merger and Acquisitions Act, as amended and other applicable laws, if any.  The merger is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, contingent on satisfaction of above approvals and other conditions, which will be outlined in the Registration Statement on Form F-4 that ChipMOS Taiwan will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "U.S. SEC").

	Industry







	Overview of the Semiconductor Manufacturing
	Process.


	The manufacturing of semiconductors is a complex process that requires increasingly sophisticated engineering and manufacturing expertise. The manufacturing process may be broadly divided into the following stages:



	 


Click to enlarge


	 

















	Process






	  






	Description









	Circuit Design





	  




	The design of a semiconductor is developed by laying out circuit patterns and interconnections.













	Wafer Fabrication





	  




	Wafer fabrication begins with the generation of a photomask, a photographic negative onto which a circuit design pattern is etched or transferred by an electron beam or laser
	beam writer. Each completed wafer contains many fabricated chips, each known as a die.













	Wafer Probe





	  




	Each individual die is then electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded, or, in some cases, salvaged for repair.













	Assembly





	  




	The assembly of semiconductors serves to protect the die, facilitates its integration into electronic systems and enables the dissipation of heat. The process begins with the
	dicing of the wafers into chips. Each die is affixed to a leadframe-based or organic substrate-based package. Then, electrical connections are formed, in many cases by connecting the terminals on the die to the inner leads of the package using fine
	metal wires. Finally, each chip is encapsulated for protection, usually in a molded epoxy enclosure.













	Final Test





	  




	Assembled semiconductors are tested to ensure that the device meets performance specifications. Testing takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each
	application. For memory semiconductors, this process also includes burn-in testing to screen out defective devices by applying very high temperatures and voltages to the memory device.

	Outsourcing Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing.


	Historically, integrated device
	manufacturers, or IDMs, designed, manufactured, tested and assembled semiconductors primarily at their own facilities. In recent years, there has been a trend in the industry to outsource stages in the manufacturing process to reduce the high fixed
	costs resulting from the increasingly complex manufacturing process. Virtually every significant stage of the manufacturing process can be outsourced. The independent semiconductor manufacturing services market currently consists of wafer
	fabrication and probing services and semiconductor testing and assembly services. Most of the worlds major IDMs now use some independent semiconductor manufacturing services to maintain a strategic mix of internal and external manufacturing
	capacity. We believe that many of these IDMs are significantly reducing their investments in new semiconductor testing and assembly facilities. The availability of technologically advanced independent semiconductor manufacturing services has also
	enabled the growth of fabless semiconductor companies that focus exclusively on semiconductor design and marketing and outsource their fabrication, testing and assembly requirements to independent companies. We believe the outsourcing of
	semiconductor manufacturing services, and in particular of testing and assembly services, will increase for many reasons, including the following:



	 





	 




	




	 







	Significant Capital Expenditure Requirements.


	Driven by increasingly sophisticated technological requirements, wafer fabrication, testing
	and assembly processes have become highly complex, requiring substantial investment in specialized equipment and facilities and sophisticated engineering and manufacturing expertise. In addition, product life cycles have been shortening, magnifying
	the need to continually upgrade or replace manufacturing, testing and assembly equipment to accommodate new products. As a result, new investments in in-house fabrication, testing and assembly facilities are becoming less desirable for IDMs because
	of the high investment costs, as well as difficulties in achieving sufficient economies of scale and utilization rates to be competitive with the independent service providers. Independent foundry, testing and assembly companies, on the other hand,
	are able to realize the benefits of specialization and achieve economies of scale by providing services to a large base of customers across a wide range of products. This enables them to reduce costs and shorten production cycles through high
	capacity utilization and process expertise.






	 





	 




	




	 







	Increasing Focus on Core Competencies.


	As the costs of semiconductor manufacturing facilities increase, semiconductor companies are
	expected to further outsource their manufacturing operations such as: wafer fabrication, testing and assembly requirements that allow them to focus their resources on semiconductor design and marketing, which these firms consider to be their core
	competencies.






	 





	 




	




	 







	Time-to-Market Pressure.


	Increasingly short product life cycles have amplified time-to-market pressure for semiconductor companies,
	leading them to rely increasingly on independent companies as a key source for effective wafer fabrication, testing and assembly services.









	Semiconductor Testing and Assembly Services Industry.


	Growth in the semiconductor testing and assembly services industry is driven by increased outsourcing of the various stages of the
	semiconductor manufacturing process by IDMs and fabless semiconductor companies.






	The Semiconductor Industry and Conditions of
	Outsourcing in Taiwan and Mainland China.


	Taiwan is one of the worlds leading locations for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing. The semiconductor industry in Taiwan has developed such that the various stages of the semiconductor
	manufacturing process have been disaggregated, thus allowing for specialization. The disaggregation of the semiconductor manufacturing process in Taiwan permits these semiconductor manufacturing service providers to focus on particular parts of the
	production process, develop economies of scale, maintain higher capacity utilization rates and remain flexible in responding to customer needs by lowering time-to-market pressure faced by semiconductor companies. There are several leading service
	providers in Taiwan, each of which offers substantial capacity, high-quality manufacturing, leading semiconductor wafer fabrication, test, assembly and process technologies, and a full range of services. These service providers have access to an
	educated labor pool and a large number of engineers suitable for sophisticated manufacturing industries. As a result, many of the worlds leading semiconductor




	 






	 




	S-5








	Table of Contents






	companies outsource some or all of their semiconductor manufacturing needs to Taiwans semiconductor manufacturing service providers and take advantage of the close proximity among
	facilities. In addition, companies located in Taiwan are very active in the design and manufacture of electronic systems, which has created significant local demand for semiconductor devices.




	Mainland China has emerged as a similarly attractive location for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing. Mainland China is an attractive manufacturing location for electronic products because companies
	can take advantage of a well-educated yet low-cost labor force, cost savings due to tax benefits and a large domestic market. These factors have driven increased relocation of much of the electronics industry manufacturing and supply chain to
	Mainland China. An increasing number of global electronic systems manufacturers and contract manufacturers are relocating or have relocated production facilities to Mainland China. We believe that these electronic product manufacturers and contract
	manufacturers will source an increasing portion of their demand for semiconductors from semiconductor suppliers located in Mainland China in order to reduce production cycle times, decrease costs, simplify supply chain logistics and meet local
	content requirements. In line with this trend, we have in recent years expanded our operations in Mainland China.







	Our Business Strategies





	Our goal is to reinforce our position as a leading independent provider of semiconductor testing and assembly
	services, concentrating principally on memory, logic/mixed-signal and LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors. The principal components of our business strategy are set forth below.






	Focus on Providing Our Services to Potential Growth Segments of the Semiconductor Industry.


	We intend to continue our focus on developing
	and providing advanced testing and assembly services for potential growth segments of the semiconductor industry, such as memory, logic/mixed-signal, LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors and bumping services. We believe that our
	investments in equipment and research and development in some of these areas allow us to offer a differentiated service from our competition. In order to benefit from the expected resumption of growth in these segments, we intend to continue to
	invest in capacity to meet the testing and assembly requirements of these key semiconductor market segments.






	Continue to Invest in the
	Research and Development of Advanced Testing and Assembly Technologies.


	We believe that our ability to progressively provide more advanced testing and assembly services to customers is critical to our business. In addition, advanced
	semiconductor testing and assembly services typically have the potential to generate higher margins due to the greater expertise required and the more sophisticated technologies used. We will continue to invest in the research and development of
	advanced testing and assembly technologies. For example, we are expanding our capabilities in fine-pitch BGA, multi-chip package (MCP), system in package (SiP), flip chip, wafer level chip scale packaging (WLCSP), and the testing and assembly of
	COFs. We have also introduced fine-pitch COF based on our proprietary technology and COG testing and assembly services for LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors.




	In addition, we will continue to pursue the development of new testing and assembly technologies jointly with domestic and foreign research institutions and universities. We expect to focus our research
	and development efforts in the following areas:



	 





	 




	




	 





	developing new software conversion programs to increase the capabilities of our testers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	developing advanced assembly technologies for flip chip and high-speed and mobile memory devices;






	 





	 




	




	 





	developing fine-pitch bumping, chip probing and bonding technologies for fine pitch LCD drivers;






	 





	 




	




	 





	developing copper bump plating technology to reduce the gold usage for LCD drivers and launch WLCSP, thick copper and flip chip products to serve
	logic/mixed-signal and memory products;






	 





	 




	




	 





	improving manufacturing yields for new assembly technologies;







	 






	 




	S-6








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 





	improving manufacturing yields for new assembly technologies; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	developing environmentally friendly assembly services that focus on eliminating the lead and halogen elements from the materials employed in the
	package and reducing the toxicity of gaseous chemical wastes.







	In 2011, we spent approximately 2.3% of our net revenue on
	research and development. We will continue to invest our resources to recruit and retain experienced research and development personnel. As of September 30, 2012, our research and development team comprised 276 persons.






	Build on Our Strong Presence in Taiwan and Expand Our Operations Outside Taiwan.


	We intend to build on our strong presence in key centers
	of semiconductor and electronics manufacturing to grow our business. Currently, most of our operations are in Taiwan, one of the worlds leading locations for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing. This presence provides us with several
	advantages. First, our proximity to other semiconductor companies is attractive to customers who wish to outsource various stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process. Second, our proximity to many of our suppliers, customers and the end-users
	of our customers products enables us to be involved in the early stages of the semiconductor design process, enhances our ability to quickly respond to our customers changing requirements and shortens our customers time-to-market.
	Third, we have access to an educated labor pool and a large number of engineers who are able to work closely with our customers and other providers of semiconductor manufacturing services.




	As with our operations in Taiwan, we intend to similarly benefit from our operations in Mainland China. We intend to invest in and expand our operations in Mainland China, increasing our testing and
	assembly services for memory and logic/mixed-signal semiconductors. Depending on customers demands, market conditions and other relevant considerations, we may from time to time look into other opportunities to expand our operations outside
	Taiwan.






	Expand Our Offering of Vertically Integrated Services.


	We believe that one of our competitive strengths is our ability
	to provide vertically integrated services to our customers. Vertically integrated services consist of the integrated testing, assembly and direct shipment of semiconductors to end-users designated by our customers. Providing vertically integrated
	services enables us to shorten lead times for our customers. As time-to-market and cost increasingly become sources of competitive advantage for our customers, they increasingly value our ability to provide them with comprehensive back-end services.




	Through ChipMOS Taiwan, ThaiLin and ChipMOS Shanghai, we are able to offer vertically integrated services for a broad range of products,
	including memory, logic/mixed-signal and LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors. We believe that these affiliations, which offer complementary technologies, products and services as well as additional capacity, will continue to
	enhance our own development and expansion efforts into new and potential growth markets. We intend to establish new alliances with leading companies and, if suitable opportunities arise, engage in merger and acquisition activities that will further
	expand the services we can provide.






	Focus on Increasing Sales through Long-Term Agreements with Key Customers as well as Business with
	Smaller Customers.


	From time to time, we strategically agree to commit a portion of our testing and assembly capacity to certain of our customers. We intend to continue to focus on increasing sales to key customers through long-term capacity
	agreements. The customers with which we currently have long-term agreements include a reputable memory customer based in the US. Global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tight credit conditions and recession
	in most major economies continuing into 2011. Beginning in 2008, we also resumed our focus on our business with smaller customers or customers who do not place orders on a regular basis. We believe that the dual focused strategy will assist us to be
	better prepared for the current economic volatility and ensure maximum utilization rate of our capacity.

	Recent Developments







	Extension of Wafer Test Service Agreement with Spansion


	On June 25, 2012, our majority-owned subsidiary, ChipMOS Taiwan, announced that it reached an agreement to extend its exclusive
	wafer sort services contract with Spansion Inc. for two years until April 2014. ChipMOS Taiwan has served as Spansions exclusive wafer sort sub-contractor since April 2010.






	Metal Composite Bump Technology Development.


	To lessen the effects that rising gold prices have on the standard gold bumping processes used for LCD driver integrated circuits
	(

	ICs

	), we developed a lower cost, copper-based technology that replaces the majority of the gold in the bump structure, or metal composite bump (

	MCB

	). We began implementing the MCB technology for both 8 -and 12-
	inch wafers during Q3 2011. This technology is experiencing positive market acceptance and enables our customers to improve products margins. Further, the developed copper plating capabilities also enable us to enter advanced packaging segments,
	such as WLCSP and flip chip packaging, that allow us to capture greater market share for low-density memory products, mixed-signal products and power devices. These products are used in both mobile- and cloud-computing system structures. Given the
	strong demand for products in these end-markets, we believe that advanced packaging processes are increasingly important in todays OSAT market and offer strong growth opportunities. Finally, in conjunction with our assembly and testing
	services, introducing additional advanced packaging alternatives allows us to improve our standing as a full turn-key service provider in this market.




	At current output and capacity levels, we are confident that we will be able to continue meeting our customers demand for services. Recently, output for our gold bumping line reached approximately
	100,000 8-inch wafer equivalent per month, and our 8-inch copper plating capacity for MCB, WLCSP and flip chip increased to 10,000 wafers per month as of September 30, 2012. By Q4 2012, our 12-inch wafer copper bump plating line will provide
	capacity for 8,000 wafers per month. In addition, our new 12-inch gold bumping line capacity is 16,000 wafers per month, positioning us to accommodate the LCD driver industry transition to this wafer size. These recently added capabilities allow us
	to further enhance our services for existing customers and are key enablers for new market entry.






	Purchase of New Facility in Taiwan
	Science Park.


	On April 6, 2012, our majority-owned subsidiary, ChipMOS Taiwan, received confirmation from Taiwan Tainan District Court that it won a public bid to purchase an existing building in the Southern Taiwan Science Park for
	approximately US$10.1 million. The building is located directly across from ChipMOS existing facility in the Southern Taiwan Science Park and features approximately 393,173 square feet of floor space. The processes of title transfer and
	registration of the building are complete, and the title deed of building was received on May 8, 2012. This new facility will be used to accommodate the expansion of our LCD Driver Group and Assembly Group.






	Expansion of COF and COG Assembly and Test.


	During Q1 2012, we began adding assembly and test capacity for COF and COG to accommodate the
	growth demands of our customers. We completed our capacity expansion by the end of Q2 2012, and we anticipate that the expanded COF and COG capacity will be fully reflected in our Q4 2012 revenue.






	Building Capacity for WLCSP and Flip Chip Packaging.


	We are currently ramping production in our WLCSP product assembly line to meet
	e-compass demand requirements of AKM Semiconductor, Inc., a Japan-domiciled provider of mixed-signal ICs for consumer, automotive and communications applications. We expect to reach full production during Q2 2013. In addition, we are preparing a
	flip chip assembly line that will provide 12-inch wafer copper plating services for power quad flat no-lead (power QFN) packages, high-density DRAM and mixed-signal products. This capability will enable us to provide turn-key services for these
	products, and we believe that it will enhance our ability to capture additional market share for our bumping business. We expect that this assembly line will be operational by Q3 2013.

	Criminal Proceeding Process Update for Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng, our Chairman and Chief Executive
	Officer, and Mr. Hung-Chiu Hu, our Former Director.


	On May 21, 2012, the Taiwan High Court held a hearing to examine the legality and admissibility of certain evidence related to the case. The Court has not made any substantial
	rulings with respect to the outcome of the case. The date of next hearing is scheduled to be held on November 1, 2012.






	Share
	Repurchase Plan.


	We effected a US$10 million share repurchase program in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended on August 20, 2012. The share repurchase plan was completed on
	October 12, 2012 and 654 thousand shares were repurchased under the plan. These repurchased shares were retired and cancelled.

	RISK FACTORS





	An investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this prospectus supplement, you
	should carefully consider each of the following risk factors, the risk factors contained in the accompanying prospectus and those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F on file with the SEC which is incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus supplement. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The risks and
	uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment. Please see Incorporation of
	Documents By Reference.




	In addition, you should also consider carefully the risks set forth below as well as other information we
	include or incorporate by reference in any subsequent prospectus supplement that may be filed by us before investing in any securities offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The risks and uncertainties we have
	described are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. These risks could materially affect our business, results of
	operations or financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline.





	Risks Relating to Our Business







	If we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive semiconductor testing and assembly markets, we may lose customers and our income
	may decline.






	The semiconductor testing and assembly markets are very competitive. We face competition from a number of IDMs with
	in-house testing and assembly capabilities and other independent semiconductor testing and assembly companies. Our competitors may have access to more advanced technologies and greater financial and other resources than we do. Many of our
	competitors have shown a willingness to reduce prices quickly and sharply in the past to maintain capacity utilization in their facilities during periods of reduced demand. In addition, an increasing number of our competitors conduct their
	operations in lower cost centers in Asia such as Mainland China, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. Any renewed or continued erosion in the prices or demand for our testing and assembly services as a result of increased competition could
	adversely affect our profits.






	The ongoing criminal proceeding of and adverse publicity associated with Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng, our
	Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Hung-Chiu Hu, our former director, could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our stock price to decline.






	Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng, our chairman and chief executive officer, was indicted by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, or the prosecutor, in December 2005. Based upon information released by the
	prosecutor, the indictment alleges that Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng, as instructed by Mr. Hung-Chiu Hu, purchased repurchase notes on January 6, January 13, and January 28, 2004 from Founder Associates Limited, a British Virgin
	Islands company affiliated with Mega Securities Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Barits International Securities Co., Ltd.), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately US$29 million, by using corporate funds from ChipMOS Taiwan and ThaiLin. The
	indictment further alleges that these repurchase notes were used as a cover to misuse the corporate funds of Mosel Vitelic Inc. (Mosel), and its affiliated entities, including ChipMOS Taiwan and ThaiLin, in violation of ROC law. In
	addition, the indictment alleges that Mr. Hu and others were engaged in the insider trading of the securities of Mosel in violation of ROC law, but none of the current officers at ChipMOS Taiwan or ThaiLin was indicted in this regard.




	On January 5, 2006, our board established a special committee to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the indictment of
	Mr. Cheng. The special committee engaged K&L Gates LLP (formerly Kirkpatrick & Lockhart




	 




	S-13








	Table of Contents




	Preston Gates Ellis LLP) as its independent international legal counsel, Baker & McKenzie as its independent ROC legal counsel, and Ernst & Young (formerly Diwan,
	Ernst & Young) as its financial advisor to assist in its investigation. As of September 30, 2012, the special committee was solely comprised of Mr. Yeong-Her Wang, our independent director.




	The special committees investigation focused on (1) the probability that Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng would be convicted on the charges described
	in the indictment, (2) whether the indictment resulted in any pecuniary or other damage to us, (3) whether there were any internal control weaknesses related to the investments in repurchase notes within ChipMOS Bermuda and its
	subsidiaries and (4) whether ChipMOS Bermuda is required by applicable laws or the NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements to take any action in connection with the indictment. The special committee did not attempt to independently
	determine whether Mr. Cheng had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the investments in repurchase notes, irrespective of whether such wrongdoing would lead to a conviction on the charges under the indictment.




	On June 28, 2006, the special committee issued its report, including its findings and recommendations. Based upon the results of its investigation,
	it found that (1) Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng has declared himself not guilty of the charges described in the indictment, (2) Baker & McKenzie, after reviewing the indictment and the prosecutors exhibits, has found that the
	evidence produced by the prosecutor seems to be inadequate and that there is a low probability of the charge of irregular transactions in the indictment being founded, (3) the financial advisor to the special committee has found that we
	suffered no loss (not taking into account exchange rate factors) and that all monies (capital and interest) were remitted back to our subsidiaries involved, (4) we have suffered no identifiable harm to our reputation or business and
	(5) Mr. Cheng has not been impaired by the indictment to perform as our chairman and chief executive officer. The special committee recommended that our board maintain Mr. Cheng as our chairman and chief executive officer with full
	responsibilities and our board unanimously (with Mr. Cheng having recused himself) resolved to accept and adopt the special committees recommendation with regard to Mr. Cheng. Our board of directors also resolved to continue the role
	of the special committee for the duration of the ongoing criminal proceeding involving Mr. Cheng to actively monitor any developments of the criminal investigation and take or recommend any appropriate action in light of such developments.




	On October 1, 2007, the Taipei District Court found Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng not guilty, and on October 22, 2007, the prosecutor
	appealed the Taipei District Court decision at the Taiwan High Court. The Taiwan High Court held four trial hearings in 2008, six trial hearings in 2009 and six trial hearings in 2010. Due to the rotation of the judges in the meantime, a new bench
	was formed at the beginning of 2010 to try this case. Two trial hearings have since been conducted by the new bench in 2011. On May 21, 2012, the Taiwan High Court held a hearing to examine the legality and admissibility of certain evidence
	related to the case. The Court has not made any substantial rulings with respect to the outcome of the case. The date of next hearing is scheduled to be held on November 1, 2012.




	Theoretically, as a result of prosecutors appeal, Mr. Cheng may still be convicted of one or more charges in the indictment. In addition, new evidence that leads to additional criminal charges
	and/or an adverse judgment against Mr. Cheng may be produced during the ongoing criminal investigation, and the special committee may make recommendations to our board in respect of Mr. Chengs positions with us or our subsidiaries.
	However, up to the present, no new evidence or charge has been presented or collected by the prosecutor or the Court. Therefore, we are reasonably confident that the non-guilty judgment for Mr. Cheng will be maintained by the Taiwan High Court.
	If Mr. Cheng is convicted, or in light of any new developments, the special committee may recommend or our board of directors may otherwise decide that it is in the Companys best interests that Mr. Cheng no longer serves in all or
	some of his current capacities with us or our subsidiaries, or if Mr. Cheng resigns as a result of a final adverse judgment rendered against him by the court, or otherwise, the public perception of us may be seriously harmed and we would lose
	some or all of the services of Mr. Cheng. In addition, if Mr. Cheng is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, the ROC Financial Supervisory Commission may subject ChipMOS Taiwan or ThaiLin to certain restrictions on financing activities
	if Mr. Cheng continues to serve as the chairman or president of ChipMOS Taiwan or ThaiLin. Mr. Cheng is very important to our current




	 




	S-14








	Table of Contents




	on-going business operations and our relationships with our customers and financing sources, and our loss of his services due to and any adverse publicity from the trial or conviction of
	Mr. Cheng or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation and prospects and therefore cause our stock price to decline.






	We are highly dependent on the market for memory products. A downturn in market prices for these products could significantly reduce our net revenue and net income.






	A significant portion of our net revenue is derived from testing and assembling memory semiconductors. Our net revenue derived from the testing and
	assembly of memory semiconductors accounted for 66%, 62% and 57% of our net revenue in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. In the past, our service fees for testing and assembling memory semiconductors were sharply reduced in tandem with the decrease
	in the average selling price of DRAM in the semiconductor industry. The continuing oversupply of DRAM products in 2008 and the weak demand in the DRAM market in 2009, 2010 and 2011 resulted in significant reductions in the price of DRAM products,
	which in turn drove down the average prices for our testing and assembly services for DRAM products in these periods. We cannot assure you that there will not be further downturns in DRAM prices in the future.






	A decrease in market demand for LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors may adversely affect our capacity utilization rates and
	thereby negatively affect our profitability.






	Our testing and assembly services for LCD and other flat-panel display driver
	semiconductors generated net revenue of NT$1,986 million, NT$3,199 million and NT$3,986 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We invested NT$37 million, NT$1,659 million and NT$1,188 million in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, on equipment
	for tape carrier package, or TCP, chip-on-film, or COF and chip-on-glass, or COG, technologies, which are used in testing and assembly services for LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors. Most of this equipment may not be used for
	technologies other than TCP, COF or COG. The market demand for LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors and related testing and assembly services increased in 2011 compared to the market demand in 2010. Any significant decrease in
	demand for these products and our related services, however, would significantly impair our capacity utilization rates. That may result in our inability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the significant depreciation expenses for the equipment
	used in testing and assembling LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductors, thereby negatively affecting our profitability. See also Because of our high fixed costs, if we are unable to achieve relatively high capacity
	utilization rates, our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected.






	Our significant amount of indebtedness and interest
	expense will limit our cash flow and could adversely affect our operations.






	We have a significant level of debt and interest expense.
	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately NT$8,484 million and NT$1,231 million outstanding long-term and short-term indebtedness, respectively. Our long-term indebtedness as of December 31, 2011, represented bank loans with an
	interest rate between 1.92% and 3.0421%. As of December 31, 2011, NT$799 million of our short-term indebtedness and NT$8,484 million of our long-term indebtedness was secured by collateral comprised of assets owned by ChipMOS Taiwan and
	ThaiLin.




	Our significant indebtedness poses risks to our business, including the risks that:




	we may have to use a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the
	funds available for working capital, capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;



	 





	 




	




	 





	insufficient cash flow from operations may force us to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which we may be unable to do at all or on terms
	favorable to us;






	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to sell assets or seek additional capital may be adversely affected by security interests in our assets granted to our lenders as
	collateral;







	 




	S-15








	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	our debt service obligations increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures, because many of our competitors may be less leveraged than we are.







	For additional information on our indebtedness, see Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and
	ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.






	Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may cause the market price of our common shares to be volatile.






	Our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period and may continue to vary in the future. Among the more important factors
	affecting our quarterly and annual results of operations are the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to accurately predict customer demand, as we must commit significant capital expenditures in anticipation of future orders;






	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to quickly adjust to unanticipated declines or shortfalls in demand and market prices for our testing and assembly services, due to our
	high percentage of fixed costs;






	 





	 




	




	 





	changes in prices for our testing and assembly services;

	Because of the factors listed above, our future results of operations or growth rates may be below the expectations of research analysts and investors.
	If so, the market price of our common shares, and the market value of your investment, may fall.






	We depend on key customers for a
	substantial portion of our net revenue and a loss of, or deterioration of the business from, or delayed payment by, any one of these customers could result in decreased net revenue and materially adversely affect our results of operations and
	financial condition.






	We depend on a small group of customers for a substantial portion of our business. In 2011, our top five
	customers, collectively accounted for 50% of our net revenue. As part of our strategy, we have been focusing on sales to key customers through long-term service agreements. We also focus on our business with smaller customers and customers who do
	not place orders on a regular basis. We expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue. Any adverse development in our key customers operations, competitive
	position or customer base could materially reduce our net revenue and adversely affect our business and profitability.




	Our customer ProMOS
	Technologies Inc. (ProMOS) is an affiliate of Mosel. Commencing April 1, 2011, Mosel and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are no longer related parties to the Company. In March 2008, ProMOS defaulted on its payment obligations
	under our long-term service agreement. In November 2008, we entered into a revised subcontracting contract with ProMOS by requiring ProMOS to provide wafers with a value of 80% of the subcontracting fee as collateral. Effective March 2009, we
	started to request prepayments from

	ProMOS. In May 2009, a further revised subcontracting contract was entered into by and between us and ProMOS under which ProMOS provided us with wafer as a pledge for its payment obligations and
	Work-In-Process, or WIP and existing finished goods would serve as lien material. Part of ProMOS receivables had been recovered through sales of the pledged wafer and lien material back to ProMOS with a discount to market price, and the
	remaining outstanding accounts receivables have been secured by equipment mortgage under the same contract arrangement. NT$7 million was received by April 2010. The remaining outstanding accounts receivables have been paid under the amended
	subcontracting contract and settlement with ProMOS. ProMOS paid us NT$200 million and NT$24 million in May 2010 and December 2010, respectively and the remaining NT$202 million was paid in nine monthly installments ended on March 15, 2011. All
	sums have been received in 2011. We have no other concern regarding the collection with ProMOS in 2011. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyCustomers in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011,
	which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.




	In January 2009, our customer Spansion LLC (Spansion)
	defaulted on its payment obligations under our long-term service agreement and we subsequently terminated the long-term service agreement with Spansion on February 19, 2009. On March 1, 2009, Spansion filed for a voluntary petition for
	reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On January 25, 2010, ChipMOS Taiwan entered into a definitive Transfer of Claim Agreement to sell to Citigroup Financial Products Inc. (Citigroup) the general unsecured
	claim reflected in the proof of claim against Spansion. In February 2010, we received from Citigroup the purchase price for the Undisputed Claim of NT$1,118 million against accounts receivable of NT$2,186 million. We recognized a related loss on
	sale of receivables of NT$1,068 million and we reversed the related allowance for doubtful receivables of NT$2,186 million in 2010. On October 4, 2010, ChipMOS Taiwan entered into a settlement agreement with Spansion LLC for the general
	unsecured claim on breach of contract and liquidated damages rights reflected in the proof of claim, Claim No. 5, against Spansion Inc., Spansion Technology LLC, Spansion LLC, Spansion International Inc. and Cerium Laboratories LLC filed by
	ChipMOS Taiwan in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. In October 2010, the Company received payment of NT$2,118 million under the Transfer of Claim Agreement to Citigroup. See Item 4. Information on the CompanyCustomers in our Annual Report
	on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.




	Since
	semiconductor companies generally rely on service providers with whom they have established relationships to meet their testing and assembly needs for their applications and new customers usually require us to pass a lengthy and rigorous
	qualification process, if we lose any of our key customers, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that receivable collection difficulties experienced by us will not occur in the future. If any of our key
	customers reduces or cancels its orders or terminates existing contractual arrangements, and if we are unable to attract new customers and establish new contractual arrangements with existing or new customers, our net revenue could be reduced and
	our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.






	Because of our high fixed costs, if we are unable to
	achieve relatively high capacity utilization rates, our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected.






	Our operations are
	characterized by a high proportion of fixed costs. For memory and logic/mixed-signal semiconductor testing services, our fixed costs represented 80%, 73% and 68% of our total cost of revenue in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. For memory and
	logic/mixed-signal semiconductor assembly services, our fixed costs represented 30%, 24% and 23% of our total cost of revenue in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. For LCD and other flat-panel display driver semiconductor testing and assembly
	services, our fixed costs represented 64%, 55% and 52% of our total cost of revenue in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. For bumping services, our fixed costs represented 38%, 27% and 23% of our total cost of revenue in 2009, 2010 and 2011,
	respectively. Our profitability depends in part not only on absolute pricing levels for our services, but also on the utilization rates for our testing and assembly equipment, commonly referred to as capacity utilization rates. Increases
	or decreases in our capacity utilization rates can significantly affect our gross margins as unit costs generally




	 




	S-17








	Table of Contents




	decrease as the fixed costs are allocated over a larger number of units. In the past, our capacity utilization rates have fluctuated significantly as a result of the fluctuations in the market
	demand for semiconductors. If we fail to increase or maintain our capacity utilization rates, our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, we have entered into various long-term assembly and testing services agreements with
	certain of our customers that may require us to incur significant capital expenditures. If we are unable to achieve high capacity utilization rates for the equipment purchased pursuant to these agreements, our gross margins may be materially and
	adversely affected.






	The testing and assembly process is complex and our production yields and customer relationships may suffer as a
	result of defects or malfunctions in our testing and assembly equipment and the introduction of new packages.






	Semiconductor testing
	and assembly are complex processes that require significant technological and process expertise. Semiconductor testing involves sophisticated testing equipment and computer software. We develop computer software to test our customers
	semiconductors. We also develop conversion software programs that enable us to test semiconductors on different types of testers. Similar to most software programs, these software programs are complex and may contain programming errors or
	bugs. In addition, the testing process is subject to human error by our employees who operate our testing equipment and related software. Any significant defect in our testing or conversion software, malfunction in our testing equipment
	or human error could reduce our production yields and damage our customer relationships.




	The assembly process involves a number of steps,
	each of which must be completed with precision. Defective packages primarily result from:



	 





	 




	




	 





	contaminants in the manufacturing environment;






	 





	 




	




	 





	human error;






	 





	 




	




	 





	equipment malfunction;






	 





	 




	




	 





	defective raw materials; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	defective plating services.







	These and other factors have, from time to time, contributed to lower production yields. They may do so in the future, particularly as we expand our
	capacity or change our processing steps. In addition, to be competitive, we must continue to expand our offering of packages. Our production yields on new packages typically are significantly lower than our production yields on our more established
	packages. Our failure to maintain high standards or acceptable production yields, if significant and prolonged, could result in a loss of customers, increased costs of production, delays, substantial amounts of returned goods and related claims by
	customers. Further, to the extent our customers have set target production yields, we may be required to compensate our customers in a pre-agreed manner. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business reputation and result in
	reduced net revenue and profitability.






	Because of the highly cyclical nature of our industry, our capital requirements are difficult to
	plan. If we cannot obtain additional capital when we need it, we may not be able to maintain or increase our current growth rate and our profits will suffer.






	As our industry is highly cyclical and rapidly changing, our capital requirements are difficult to plan. To remain competitive, we may need capital to fund the expansion of our facilities as well as to
	fund our equipment purchases and research and development activities. To meet our liquidity, capital spending and other capital needs, we have taken and plan to take certain measures to generate additional working capital and to save cash. See
	Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsLiquidity and Capital Resources in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. We
	cannot assure you that these plans and measures will be implemented or will provide sufficient sources of capital.

	In addition, future capacity expansions or market or other developments may require additional funding. Our
	ability to obtain external financing in the future depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include:



	 





	 




	




	 





	our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;






	 





	 




	




	 





	general market conditions for financing activities by semiconductor testing and assembly companies; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	economic, political and other conditions in Taiwan and elsewhere.







	If we are unable to obtain funding in a timely manner or on acceptable terms, our growth prospects and potential future profitability will suffer.






	Disputes over intellectual property rights could be costly, deprive us of technologies necessary for us to stay competitive, render us unable to provide some of our services and reduce our
	opportunities to generate revenue.






	Our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend, in part, on our ability
	to protect our proprietary technologies and to secure, on commercially acceptable terms, critical technologies that we do not own. We cannot assure you that we will be able to independently develop, or secure from any third party, the technologies
	required for our testing and assembly services. Our failure to successfully obtain these technologies may seriously harm our competitive position and render us unable to provide some of our services. Our ability to compete successfully also depends
	on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The semiconductor testing and assembly industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We may incur legal
	liabilities if we infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. We are not able to ascertain what patent applications have been filed in the United States or elsewhere, however, until they are granted. If any third
	party succeeds in its intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers, we could be required to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	discontinue using the disputed process technologies, which would prevent us from offering some of our testing and assembly services;






	 





	 




	




	 





	pay substantial monetary damages;






	 





	 




	




	 





	develop non-infringing technologies, which may not be feasible; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	acquire licenses to the infringed technologies, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.







	Any one of these developments could impose substantial financial and administrative burdens on us and hinder our business. We are, from time to time,
	involved in litigation in respect of intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant, is costly and diverts our resources. If we fail to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or if litigation,
	regardless of the outcome, relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters occurs, our costs could be substantially increased to impact our margins. Any such litigation could also prevent us from testing and assembling
	particular products or using particular technologies, which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenue. For more information on litigation in respect of intellectual property rights, see Item 8. Financial InformationLegal
	Proceedings in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.






	If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other necessary inputs from our suppliers in a timely and cost effective manner, our production schedules would be delayed and we may lose customers and
	growth opportunities and become less profitable.






	Our operations require us to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at
	acceptable prices in a timely and cost-effective manner. We source most of our raw materials, including critical materials like leadframes, organic




	 




	S-19








	Table of Contents




	substrates, epoxy, gold wire and molding compound for assembly, and tapes for TCP/COF, from a limited group of suppliers. We purchase all of our materials on a purchase order basis and have no
	long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. From time to time, suppliers have extended lead times, increased the price or limited the supply of required materials to us because of market shortages. Consequently, we may, from time to time,
	experience difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of raw materials on a timely basis. In addition, from time to time, we may reject materials that do not meet our specifications, resulting in declines in output or yield. Although we typically
	maintain at least two suppliers for each key raw material, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and other supplies of an acceptable quality in the future. It usually takes from three to six
	months to switch from one supplier to another, depending on the complexity of the raw material. If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other necessary inputs in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may need to delay our production and
	delivery schedules, which may result in the loss of business and growth opportunities and could reduce our profitability.






	If we are
	unable to obtain additional testing and assembly equipment or facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders and may become less competitive and less profitable.






	The semiconductor testing and assembly business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in expensive equipment manufactured by a limited
	number of suppliers. The market for semiconductor testing and assembly equipment is characterized, from time to time, by intense demand, limited supply and long delivery cycles.




	Our operations and expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain equipment from a limited number of suppliers in a timely and cost-effective manner. We have no binding supply agreements with any of our
	suppliers and we acquire our testing and assembly equipment on a purchase order basis, which exposes us to changing market conditions and other significant risks. Semiconductor testing and assembly also requires us to operate sizeable facilities. If
	we are unable to obtain equipment or facilities in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations as well as our growth prospects. Previously
	we committed to acquire certain wafer sorting testers and probers under our long-term service agreement with Spansion. We terminated that agreement and commitment on February 19, 2009, after Spansion defaulted on its payment obligations.
	Currently, we do not have any long-term service agreements that require our commitment to acquire additional testing and assembly equipment or facilities, however we cannot assure you that such commitment will not be made in the future. See
	Item 4. Information on the CompanyCustomers in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.






	If we are unable to manage the expansion of our operations and resources effectively, our growth prospects may be limited and our future
	profitability may be reduced.






	We expect to continue to expand our operations and increase the number of our employees. Rapid expansion
	puts a strain on our managerial, technical, financial, operational and other resources. As a result of our expansion, we will need to implement additional operational and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel. We cannot assure
	you that we will be able to do so effectively in the future, and our failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations.






	Bermuda law may be less protective of shareholder rights than laws of the United States or other jurisdictions.






	Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association, our bye-laws and laws governing corporations incorporated in Bermuda. Shareholder suits such as class actions (as these terms are
	understood with respect to corporations incorporated in the United States) are generally not available in Bermuda. Therefore, our shareholders may be less able under Bermuda law than they would be under the laws of the United States or other
	jurisdictions to protect their interests in connection with actions by our management, members of our board of directors or our controlling shareholder.

	It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against us in the United States.






	We are incorporated in Bermuda and a majority of our directors and most of our officers are not residents of the United States. A substantial portion of
	our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to serve notice of a lawsuit on us or our directors and officers within the United States. Because most of our assets are located outside the
	United States, it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce in the United States judgments of United States courts. Appleby, our Bermuda counsel, has advised us that there is some uncertainty as to the enforcement in Bermuda, in original
	actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of liabilities predicated upon United States federal securities laws.






	Investor confidence and the market price of our common shares may be adversely impacted if we or our independent public registered accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control
	over our financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.






	We are subject to the
	SECs reporting obligations, and beginning in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2006, we have been required by the SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include a report of
	management on our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 20-F that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning in fiscal year 2007, our
	independent public registered accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Although our management concluded that our internal controls are effective in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and our
	independent public registered accounting firm has rendered its opinion that we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria set forth in Internal
	ControlIntegrated Framework issued by Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (COSO), our management may not conclude that our internal controls are effective in the future. Moreover, even if our management concludes
	that our internal controls over our financial reporting are effective, our independent public registered accounting firm may disagree. If our independent public registered accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over our
	financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent public registered accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently from us, it may decline to
	attest to our managements assessment or may issue an adverse opinion in the future. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our
	consolidated financial statements, which ultimately could negatively impact the market prices of our common shares.






	Any environmental
	claims or failure to comply with any present or future environmental regulations, or any new environmental regulations, may require us to spend additional funds, may impose significant liability on us for present, past or future actions, and may
	dramatically increase the cost of providing our services to our customers.






	We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to
	the use, storage, discharge and disposal of chemical by-products of, and water used in, our assembly and gold bumping processes. Although we have not suffered material environmental claims in the past, a failure or a claim that we have failed to
	comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations or negative publicity. New regulations could require us to acquire
	costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may materially reduce our earnings.






	Fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses.






	Currently, most of our net revenue is denominated in NT dollars. Our cost of revenue and operating expenses, on the other hand, are incurred in several
	currencies, including NT dollars, Japanese yen, US dollars and Renminbi,




	 




	S-21








	Table of Contents




	or RMB. In addition, a substantial portion of our capital expenditures, primarily for the purchase of testing and assembly equipment, has been, and is expected to continue to be, denominated in
	Japanese yen with much of the remainder in US dollars. We also have debt denominated in NT dollars, Japanese yen, US dollars and RMB. Fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily among the US dollar, the NT dollar and the Japanese yen, will affect our
	costs and operating margins in NT dollar terms. In addition, these fluctuations could result in exchange losses and increased costs in NT dollar terms. Despite selective hedging and other techniques implemented by us, fluctuations in exchange rates
	have affected, and may continue to affect, our financial condition and results of operations.






	We may not be successful in our
	acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, and may therefore be unable to implement fully our business strategy.






	As
	part of our growth strategy, we may make acquisitions and investments in companies and businesses, establish joint ventures or make dispositions of our interests. For example, in September 2007, we acquired all outstanding common shares of ChipMOS
	Taiwan through a share exchange transaction with ChipMOS Taiwan. In February 2010, we agreed to sell 15.8% of ChipMOS Taiwans outstanding shares to Siliconware Precision and the transaction was completed in January 2011. The success of our
	acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions depends on a number of factors, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to identify suitable investment, acquisition, joint venture or disposition opportunities;






	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to reach an agreement for an acquisition, investment, joint venture or disposition opportunity on terms that are satisfactory to us or at
	all;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the extent to which we are able to exercise control over the acquired or joint venture company;






	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to align the economic, business or other strategic objectives and goals of the acquired company with those of our company; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	our ability to successfully integrate the acquired or joint venture company or business with our company.







	If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, we may not be able to implement fully our business strategy to
	maintain or grow our business.






	We depend on key personnel, and our revenue could decrease and our costs could increase if we lose their
	services.






	We depend on the continued service of our executive officers and skilled engineering, technical and other personnel. We will
	also be required to hire a substantially greater number of skilled employees in connection with our expansion plans. In particular, we depend on a number of skilled employees in connection with our LCD and other flat-panel display driver
	semiconductor testing and assembly services, and the competition for such employees in Taiwan and Mainland China is intense. We may not be able to either retain our present personnel or attract additional qualified personnel as and when needed.
	Moreover, we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers nor do we have employment contracts with any of our executive officers or employees, and, as a result, none of our executive officers or employees is bound by any
	non-competition agreement. If we lose any of our key personnel, it could be very difficult to find and integrate replacement personnel, which could affect our ability to provide our services, resulting in reduced net revenue and earnings. In
	addition, we may need to increase employee compensation levels in order to retain our existing officers and employees and to attract additional personnel. As of September 30, 2012, 10.7% of the workforce at our facilities are foreign workers
	employed by us under work permits that are subject to government regulations on renewal and other terms. Consequently, if the regulations in Taiwan relating to the employment of foreign workers were to become significantly more restrictive or if we
	are otherwise unable to attract or retain these workers at reasonable cost, we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of services and may suffer reduced net revenue and earnings.

	If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our information
	technology systems, we may lose proprietary data.






	Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including
	computer hackers, employees error, malfeasance or otherwise, and result in unauthorized access to our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology
	systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in
	disclosure of our trade secrets, confidential customer, supplier or employee data, which could result in legal liability, harm to our reputation and otherwise harm our business.





	Risk Relating to Our Relationship with Mosel







	ChipMOS Taiwan entered into certain
	transactions that, if determined to have constituted impermissible financings or purchases of assets or equity of Mosel under ROC law, could result in the resignations of members of our management. As a result, our business operations could be
	disrupted and the market price of our common shares could decline.






	ROC law limits the ability of a company incorporated in Taiwan to
	purchase any equity interest in companies, directly or indirectly, holding more than 50% of its issued and outstanding voting securities or registered capital or to provide loans or other financing to any company. ChipMOS Taiwan purchased NT$242
	million worth of Mosel shares in 2002. Lee and Li, our ROC special counsel, has advised us that these purchases do not violate relevant ROC law that prohibits a subsidiary from buying or taking collateral in shares of companies holding, directly or
	indirectly, more than 50% of its issued and outstanding voting securities or registered capital, because Mosels indirect interest (calculated as the product of (i) Mosels percentage interest in ChipMOS Bermuda and (ii) ChipMOS
	Bermudas percentage interest in ChipMOS Taiwan) in ChipMOS Taiwan was less than 50% and ChipMOS Bermuda is incorporated outside of Taiwan. In 2005, ChipMOS Taiwan disposed of NT$84 million of Mosel shares, and in August 2006, ChipMOS Taiwan
	further disposed of the remaining Mosel shares for approximately NT$30 million. ChipMOS Taiwan no longer owns any Mosel shares. Lee and Li has advised that under relevant ROC law, there is no similar restriction or limitation on a subsidiarys
	disposal of its parents equity shares, if the previous acquisitions of such shares complied with relevant ROC law. However, we understand that there is no applicable judicial precedent and there is some doubt as to how a court would rule if
	presented with the situation.




	If it were to be determined that any of the transactions described above constituted an impermissible financing
	or purchase of assets of Mosel by ChipMOS Taiwan or an impermissible purchase of Mosels equity by ChipMOS Taiwan, then ChipMOS Taiwans then chairman and any responsible officers would be jointly and severally liable to ChipMOS Taiwan for
	any losses suffered by ChipMOS Taiwan and may also be severally liable criminally for any breach of fiduciary duties that resulted in losses and damages suffered by ChipMOS Taiwan. Moreover, certain of these transactions may not have been in full
	compliance with ChipMOS Taiwans then applicable internal procedures due to the failure to have received an appropriate valuation opinion prior to entering into such purchases. The failure to comply fully with ChipMOS Taiwans then
	applicable internal procedures could constitute evidence of a failure by the then chairman of ChipMOS Taiwan and responsible officers to comply fully with their fiduciary duties, which could result in them being held criminally liable for any breach
	of fiduciary duties that resulted in losses and damages to ChipMOS Taiwan. If members of our current management were held to have breached their fiduciary duties or become criminally liable for the transactions described above, they may become
	obliged, whether under law or otherwise, to resign from their respective positions at ChipMOS Bermuda and our affiliates. Any loss of the services of these persons could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and cause the market price of our
	common shares to decline.

	Risks Relating to Countries in Which We Conduct Operations







	ROC laws and regulations limit or prohibit certain technology cooperation between ROC persons or entities with PRC persons or entities, and our
	current technology transfer arrangements between ChipMOS Bermuda and ChipMOS Shanghai may be found to be in violation of any such limitation or prohibition, which may result in a fine of between NT$50 thousand and NT$25 million and the termination
	of such technology transfer arrangements and therefore have a material adverse effect on the operations of ChipMOS Shanghai and our financial condition and results of operations.






	ROC laws and regulations previously prohibited any transfer of semiconductor testing and assembly technologies to any person or entity located in Mainland China, except for transfers involving certain
	low-end semiconductor testing and assembly technologies, such as conventional wire bond assembly technology, if certain requirements are met. The ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs has the ultimate administrative authority in interpreting such laws
	and regulations. In February 2010, these restrictions have been relaxed, so that ROC entities may transfer semiconductor testing and assembly technologies to any person or entity located in Mainland China after they have obtained approval from the
	Investment Commission of the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs, or the ICM. Under a technology transfer agreement, dated August 1, 2002, ChipMOS Bermuda licensed to ChipMOS Shanghai certain testing and assembly-related technologies that were
	then controlled by ChipMOS Bermuda, which included technologies that were licensed to ChipMOS Bermuda by ChipMOS Taiwan. ChipMOS Bermuda will continue to license such technologies to ChipMOS Shanghai pursuant to a new technology transfer agreement
	dated October 3, 2011 with effective date on August 1, 2012. ChipMOS Bermuda also provided ChipMOS Shanghai with technical support and consulting services under this agreement. On April 7, 2004, ChipMOS Bermuda entered into an
	assignment agreement with ChipMOS Taiwan, pursuant to which ChipMOS Taiwan transferred all of the technologies it owned as of that date to ChipMOS Bermuda, including those previously licensed to ChipMOS Bermuda. On April 12, 2007, ChipMOS
	Bermuda entered into an assignment agreement with ChipMOS Taiwan, pursuant to which ChipMOS Taiwan assigned and transferred 50% of the title to ownership of and interest in all of the technologies and intellectual property it owned as of that date
	to ChipMOS Bermuda.




	In the opinion of Lee and Li, our ROC special counsel, our technology transfer arrangements as described above are in
	compliance with all applicable ROC laws and regulations. However, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that ROC regulatory authorities will not
	take a view contrary to the opinion of our ROC special counsel. If ChipMOS Taiwan were determined to be in violation of applicable ROC laws and regulations governing technology cooperation with PRC persons and entities, ChipMOS Taiwan may be subject
	to a fine of between NT$50 thousand and NT$25 million and may be ordered by the ICM to terminate or rectify such activity within a specified period of time. Any termination of our current technology transfer to ChipMOS Shanghai could materially
	adversely affect our Mainland China operations and our financial condition, results of operations or prospects, as well as the market price of our common shares.






	Our ability to direct the operations we conduct through our subsidiaries and affiliated companies that we do not fully own may be limited by legal duties owed to other shareholders of such
	companies.






	Certain of our operations are conducted through companies that we do not fully own. For example, certain current
	consolidated operations are conducted through ChipMOS Taiwan, our 84.2% subsidiary as of September 30, 2012, ThaiLin, ChipMOS Taiwans 42.9% owned subsidiary as of September 30, 2012, and ChipMOS Shanghai, ThaiLins wholly-owned
	subsidiary as of September 30, 2012. We also conduct other activities through our affiliated entities.




	In accordance with the various
	laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates are organized, each of our subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors owe various duties to their respective shareholders. As a result, the actions we wish
	our subsidiaries or affiliates to take could be in conflict with their or their directors legal duties owed to their other shareholders. When those conflicts arise, our ability to cause our subsidiaries or affiliates to take the action that we
	desire may be limited.

	Any future outbreak of health epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases, including avian
	influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or H1N1 influenza may materially affect our operations and business.






	An outbreak of a
	contagious disease such as New Influenza A (H1N1) or more commonly known as the swine flue, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), or more recently, avian influenza with subtypes H5N1 and H3N2, for which there is inadequate treatment
	or no known cure or vaccine, may potentially result in a quarantine of infected employees and related persons, and adversely affect our operations at one or more of our facilities or the operations of our customers or suppliers. We cannot predict
	the impact that any further future outbreak of the aforementioned influenza viruses or other diseases could have on our business and results of operations.






	We face substantial political risk associated with doing business in Taiwan, particularly due to recent domestic political events and the strained relations between the Republic of China and the
	Peoples Republic of China, that could negatively affect our business and the market price of our common shares.






	Our principal
	executive offices and most of our testing and assembly facilities are located in Taiwan. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common shares may be affected by changes in ROC
	governmental policies, as well as social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting Taiwan which are beyond our control. For example, the ROC has a unique international political status. The PRC government regards Taiwan as a
	renegade province and does not recognize the legitimacy of the ROC. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been strengthened in recent years between the ROC and the PRC, relations have often been strained. In March 2005, the PRC
	government enacted the Anti-Secession Law codifying its policy of retaining the right to use military force to gain control over Taiwan, particularly under what it considers as highly provocative circumstances, such as a declaration of
	independence by Taiwan or the refusal by the ROC to accept the PRCs stated One China policy. Past developments related to the interaction between the ROC and the PRC have on occasion depressed the market prices of the securities of
	Taiwanese or Taiwan-related companies, including our own. Relations between the ROC and the PRC and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in Taiwan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
	results of operations, as well as the market price and the liquidity of our common shares.






	We are vulnerable to natural disasters and
	other events disruptive to our business and operations.






	We currently provide most of our testing services through our facilities in
	the Hsinchu Industrial Park and the Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan and the Shanghai Qingpu Industrial Zone, and all of our assembly services through our facilities in the Southern Taiwan Science Park in Taiwan and the Shanghai Qingpu Industrial
	Zone. Significant damage or other impediments to these facilities as a result of natural disasters, industrial strikes or industrial accidents could significantly increase our operating costs.




	Taiwan is particularly susceptible to earthquakes and typhoons. For example, in late 1999, Taiwan suffered severe earthquakes that caused significant
	property damage and loss of life, particularly in the central part of Taiwan. These earthquakes damaged production facilities and adversely affected the operations of many companies involved in the semiconductor and other industries. We experienced
	NT$1 million in damages to our machinery and equipment, NT$6 million in damages to our facilities, NT$1 million in damages to our inventory and five days of delay in our production schedule as a result of these earthquakes.




	In January and February 2008, certain parts of Mainland China, particularly in the southern, central and eastern regions, experienced reportedly the most
	severe winter weather in the country in recent decades, which resulted in significant and extensive damages to factories, power lines, homes, automobiles, crops and other properties, blackouts, transportation and communications disruptions and other
	losses in the affected areas. In addition, in May 2008, certain semiconductor companies with facilities in eastern Mainland China experienced production disruption reportedly due to power stoppages caused by the failure of certain electricity supply
	system in the area where the plants are located. We cannot assure you that our facilities in the Shanghai Qingpu Industrial Zone will not be adversely affected by future snowstorms, power shortages, earthquakes or other similar events.

	The 2011 Sendai earthquake and tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast
	of Japan that occurred on March 11, 2011 (the 2011 Sendai Earthquake). The 2011 Sendai Earthquake was recorded as most powerful earthquake to hit Japan and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world overall. The earthquake
	triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations along Japans Pacific coast and in at least 20 countries, including Taiwan and Mainland China. The earthquake and tsunami resulted in deaths, injuries and people missing across the affected
	Japanese prefectures and caused extensive and severe property damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and dam collapse. Many electrical generators were disabled, and at least three nuclear power
	plant reactors partially melted down and experienced a chemical explosion extensively damaging surrounding buildings. We cannot assure you that our production facilities, operations and market located in Taiwan and Mainland China will not be
	adversely affected as result of the 2011 Sendai Earthquake, including as a result of radiation emission from the damaged nuclear power plants or subsequent future earthquakes that may take place.




	The production facilities of many of our suppliers and customers and providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, including
	foundries, are located in Taiwan and Mainland China. If our customers are adversely affected by natural disasters or other events occurring in or affecting these geographic areas, it could result in a decline in the demand for our testing and
	assembly services. If our suppliers and providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services are affected by such events, our production schedule could be interrupted or delayed. As a result, a major earthquake, snowstorm, other natural
	disaster, industrial strike, industrial accident or other disruptive event occurring in or affecting Taiwan or Mainland China could severely disrupt the normal operation of business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
	results of operations.






	Any future outbreak of radiation-related disease as a result of nuclear power plant reactors damage caused by
	the 2011 Sendai Earthquake may materially adversely affect our operations and business.






	The 2011 Sendai Earthquake raises tremendous
	concerns about the possible effects of radiation emission from the damaged nuclear power plants. Japanese official authorities are working with experts in assessing the risk and determining the best courses of actions to implement to escape harmful
	radiation. The potential health effects due to exposure to harmful radiation may be temporary or permanent harmful effects in nature.




	Multiple radioactive gases could possibly be emitted in a situation where uranium attains a meltdown state, which is a severe overheating of
	the core of a nuclear reactor, in which the core melts and radiation and heat are caused to escape. This would occur if the containment system partially or fully fails. The particles that are released with the gases due to the meltdown would be the
	spewed particles of iodine-131, strontium-90 and cesium-137. These might enter into a human by being swallowed, absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. Depending on the chemical characteristics of each of these and their predilection for certain body
	tissues, they could cause cancers of such organs as bones, soft tissues near bones, thyroid gland, and the bone marrow (typically known as leukemia).




	Acute or very high level radiation exposure can cause a person to become very ill or to die quickly. Ionizing radiation, which is defined as high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves that can break
	chemical bonds, damage humans by disrupting cellular function, particularly in tissues with rapid growth and turnover of cells. Intense, high level and/or excessive radiation exposure may result in acute radiation syndrome whereby harmful effects to
	the human body may be evidenced by skin burns, internal organ deterioration, bleeding, vomiting, bone marrow distortion and deaths. If the radiation exposure is less intense and/or more prolonged at a lower level, then the central nervous system,
	kidneys, thyroid gland, and liver may be affected. Cancer is the most well known effect, and may affect virtually any significantly exposed tissue.




	Certain health effects due to exposure to harmful radiation does not have adequate treatment or known cure or vaccine, consequently, may potentially result in a quarantine of infected employees and
	related persons, and adversely affect our operations at one or more of our facilities or the operations of our customers or suppliers.

	We cannot predict the probability of any future outbreak of radiation related diseases as a possible result of nuclear power plants damage caused by the 2011 Sendai Earthquake or the extent of
	the material adverse impact that this could have on our business and results of operations.





	Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure







	Our ability to receive dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal
	restrictions, and thereby materially adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends, repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness and otherwise fund and conduct our business.






	The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is restricted by, among other things, the availability of funds and the
	terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as statutory and other legal restrictions. In addition, although there are currently no foreign exchange control regulations which restrict the ability of our
	subsidiaries located in Taiwan to distribute dividends to us, we cannot assure you that the relevant regulations will not be changed and that the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends to us will not be restricted in the future. A
	Taiwan company is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders for any year in which it did not have either earnings or retained earnings (excluding reserves). In addition, before distributing a
	dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year, the company must recover any past losses, pay all outstanding taxes and set aside 10% of its annual net income (less prior years losses and outstanding taxes) as a legal reserve
	until the accumulated legal reserve equals its paid-in capital, and may set aside a special reserve.




	In addition, PRC law requires that our
	PRC-incorporated subsidiary only distributes dividends out of its net income, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, it is also required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax net income
	each year into its reserve fund until the accumulated legal reserve amounts to 50% of its registered capital. PRC-incorporated companies are further required to maintain a bonus and welfare fund at percentages determined at their sole discretion.
	The reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund are not distributable as dividends. Moreover, a ROC-incorporated company is only able to declare dividends at its annual general meeting of shareholders, which cannot occur until after completion of
	its annual financial statements. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends, repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness, and
	otherwise fund and conduct our business.






	ThaiLin and He & Fang 2005 Revocable Living Trust, our two largest shareholders, may
	have significant influence over our company and may cause us to take actions that may not be, or refrain from taking actions that may be, in our best interest or the best interest of our other shareholders.






	As of September 30, 2012, ThaiLin, ChipMOS Taiwans 42.9% owned subsidiary, directly owned 19.1% of our common shares. He & Fang 2005
	Revocable Living Trust owned 10.3% of our common shares according to the 13G/A filed by He Zhengxu with SEC on January 10, 2012. These two largest shareholders, individually or collectively, through their equity interests may have significant
	influence over matters submitted to our shareholders for approval and other corporate actions, such as:



	 





	 




	




	 





	election of directors;






	 





	 




	




	 





	timing and manner of dividend distributions;

	approval of contracts between us and these two largest shareholders or their respective affiliates, which could involve conflicts of interest;






	 





	 




	




	 





	open market purchase programs or other purchases of our common shares;

	




	 





	adversely affect the market price of our common shares.







	Moreover, because large shareholders have potential power to direct or influence our corporate actions, we may be required to engage in transactions that may not be agreeable to our other shareholders or
	that may not be in the best interest of our other shareholders.






	Our ability to make further investments in ChipMOS Taiwan may be
	dependent on regulatory approvals. If ChipMOS Taiwan is unable to receive the equity financing it requires, its ability to grow and fund its operations may be materially adversely affected.






	As ChipMOS Taiwan is not a listed company, it generally depends on its shareholders, ChipMOS Bermuda and Siliconware Precision, to meet its equity
	financing requirements. Any capital contribution by us to ChipMOS Taiwan may require the approval of the relevant ROC authorities. For example, any capital contribution by us to ChipMOS Taiwan will require the approval of the authorities of the
	Science Park Administration. We may not be able to obtain any such approval in the future in a timely manner, or at all. If ChipMOS Taiwan is unable to receive the equity financing it requires, its ability to grow and fund its operations may be
	materially adversely affected.





	Risks Relating to Our Common Shares







	Volatility in the price of our common shares may result in shareholder litigation that could in turn result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.






	The financial markets in the United States and other countries have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and market
	prices of technology companies have been and continue to be extremely volatile. Volatility in the price of our common shares may be caused by factors outside of our control and may be unrelated or disproportionate to our results of operations. In
	the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a public companys securities, shareholders have frequently instituted securities class action litigation against that company. Litigation of this kind could result in substantial
	costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.






	Certain provisions in our constitutive documents and in our
	severance agreements with our executive officers make the acquisition of us by another company more difficult and costly and therefore may delay, defer or prevent a change of control.






	Our bye-laws provide that our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors, each class to be re-elected only once every three years. As a result, shareholders would not generally be able
	to replace a majority of the directors until after two annual general meetings. In addition, any extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets,
	cannot be done without the approval of shareholders representing 70% of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at such general meeting called to consider such extraordinary transaction. These provisions in our
	constitutive documents may increase the difficulty faced by a party which seeks to acquire control of our board or to approve an extraordinary transaction.




	In 2007, we entered into change in control severance agreements with certain executive officers pursuant to which we agreed to pay certain severance payments if a change in control event (as defined in
	the change in control severance agreements) occurs and the employment of such executive officer is terminated by our company other than for cause or by such executive officer for good reasons within two years following the occurrence of the change
	in control event. These agreements may increase the cost of a party seeking to effect a change in control of our company.

	Future sales, pledge or issuance of common shares by us or our current shareholders could depress our
	share price and you may suffer dilution.






	Sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market, the perception that future sales
	may occur, or the pledge of a substantial portion of our common shares could depress the prevailing market price of our shares. As of September 30, 2012, we had approximately 34 million common shares issued and outstanding. ThaiLin,
	He & Fang 2005 Revocable Living Trust, Siliconware Precision, Mosel, and DLS Capital Management, LLC, our five largest shareholders, owned 6,474,211, 3,479,751, 3,043,749, 1,998,659 and 2,252,889 common shares as of September 30, 2012,
	respectively, representing in the aggregate of approximately 50.8% of our outstanding common shares. See Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsMajor Shareholders in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year
	ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement.




	Mosel in the past decided to sell a
	significant portion of our common shares in order to raise funds. In June 2006, Mosel sold 6,956,522 (1,739,130) common shares through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Giant Haven, under a shelf registration statement which has since expired. In
	addition, in March 2007, we issued 12,174,998 (3,043,749) common shares pursuant to a share purchase and subscription agreement with ChipMOS Taiwan and Siliconware Precision, and we entered into a registration rights agreement in March 2007
	with Siliconware Precision, pursuant to which we granted to Siliconware Precision certain rights to require us to register these common shares for sale under the Securities Act. In July 2007, Mosel sold 8,121,266 (2,030,316) common shares
	through Giant Haven to ProMOS and Powertech Technology, and we then granted Giant Haven, ProMOS and Powertech Technology certain rights to require us to register these common shares for sale under the Securities Act. For a shareholder that is not
	our affiliate these shares may be resold pursuant to Rule 144 after lapse of the applicable holding period. In 2008, ProMOS failed to meet its payment obligations to ThaiLin. Subsequently in March 2009, ThaiLin acquired 4,060,633
	(1,015,158) common shares from ProMOS pursuant to its enforcement of the collateral under a Stock Pledge Agreement between ThaiLin and ProMOS dated December 3, 2008. Furthermore, each of Siliconware Precision, Mosel and ThaiLin may be able
	to sell, in any three-month period, that number of those ChipMOS common shares that each of Siliconware Precision, Mosel and ThaiLin owns, as the case may be, up to the greater of (i) one percent of our outstanding common shares or
	(ii) the average weekly trading volume of our common shares as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market during the four calendar weeks prior to filing a notice under Rule 144(h) for any such sales pursuant to Rule 144(e) under the Securities Act.
	In March and April 2012, Mosel sold 800,000 common shares through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Giant Haven, under Rule 144.




	On
	September 14, 2007, ChipMOS Bermuda issued 604,124 (151,031) common shares pursuant to a share exchange transaction with ChipMOS Taiwan, under which ChipMOS Bermuda exchanged one common share for every 8.4 ChipMOS Taiwan shares then
	outstanding. Following the completion of the share exchange transaction, ChipMOS Taiwan became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In February 2010, we agreed to sell 15.8% of ChipMOS Taiwans outstanding shares to Siliconware Precision. In January
	2011, the share purchase transaction was completed and we owned 84.2% of ChipMOS Taiwans outstanding shares as of December 31, 2011. We plan to issue, from time to time, additional shares in connection with employee compensation and to
	finance possible future capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions. See Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesShare Option Plan and Share Appreciation Rights Plan in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year
	ended December 31, 2011, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus, for a discussion of the Share Option Plan that we have adopted for the benefit of all of our directors, officers, employees and consultants. The issuance of
	additional shares may have a dilutive effect on other shareholders and may cause the price of our common shares to decrease.




	In addition, the
	indictment relating to Mr. Hung-Chiu Hu alleges that embezzled funds were used in investments by PacMOS Technologies Holdings Limited (PacMOS), which, as of September 30, 2012, owned 2.6% of our outstanding common shares. As a
	result, PacMOS may be ordered by relevant authorities to dispose of its investments made with any embezzled funds, which may result in a sale of our shares by PacMOS. A sale of a

	significant number of our shares by PacMOS or our other current shareholders could depress our share price. The share numbers disclosed above, contain corresponding adjusted figures in brackets
	denoting the effect of Companys 1-for-every-4 reverse stock split effective on January 21, 2011.






	If the trading price of our
	common shares declines, we may face a limited public market for our common shares and reduced availability of future debt or equity financing.






	Companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) are subject to delisting for, among other things, failure to maintain a minimum closing bid price of US$1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
	business days. We are in compliance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 20-F. We were not in compliance with the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement from September 15, 2009 until May 5, 2010, when we
	regained compliance. During this time, we applied for, and NASDAQ approved, the transfer of our listing from NASDAQ Global Select Market to NASDAQ Capital Market. If the bid price of our common stock falls below US$1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
	business days again in the future, we may be subject to delisting. If our common shares are delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common shares would likely trade in the over-the-counter market, which could make selling our common shares more
	difficult. Smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our common shares are delisted, broker-dealers have certain
	regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common shares. These factors could limit our common shares liquidity and result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask
	prices for our common shares.




	Future declines in our share price could also significantly impair our ability to raise additional necessary
	capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. A general permission under the Exchange Control Act 1972 and the Exchange
	Control Regulation 1973 (and other relevant legislations and regulations) has been given by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA) for the issue and transfer of our common shares, notes and other securities to and between non-residents
	of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, provided that our common shares remain listed on an appointed stock exchange (which includes listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market). There can be no assurance that the BMA will give the same or a similar
	consent in the event our common shares are no longer listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market or another appointed stock exchange. In the absence of such a general consent, specific consents of the BMA would be required for all issues and transfers of
	our shares, notes and other securities, unless such issues and/or transfers fall under certain exemptions as provided by the BMA.





	Risks
	Relating to the Offering







	Market prices of companies involved in the semiconductor industry, including our company, have been highly
	volatile and shareholders may not be able to resell their common shares at or above the price they paid.






	The trading price of our
	common shares has been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to wide fluctuations. Since our common shares commenced trading on NASDAQ on June 19, 2001 through October [    ], 2012, the market price of our common
	shares has fluctuated from $0.744 to $60.000 (adjusted for the Companys 1-for-every-4 reverse stock split effective on January 21, 2011).





	Risks Relating to Economic Conditions and the Financial Markets







	The global credit
	and financial markets crisis could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.






	Since 2009 and through
	2011, global credit and financial markets have experienced severe disruptions. These include diminished liquidity and limited availability of credit, reduced consumer confidence, reduced economic




	 




	S-30








	Table of Contents




	growth, increased unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. Limited availability of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending. This in
	turn may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. Financial difficulties experienced by our customers or suppliers as a result of these conditions could lead to production delays and delays or
	defaults in payment of accounts receivable. Continuing credit markets disruption restricts our access to capital and limits our ability to fund operations or to refinance maturing obligations as they become due through additional borrowing or other
	sources of financing. We are not able to predict the duration or extent of the current global credit and financial markets crisis. These conditions increase the difficulty of accurately forecasting and planning our business activities. If these
	conditions and uncertainties continue or if credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions further deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.





	Risks Relating to Our Industry







	Because we depend on the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is characterized by significant and sometimes prolonged downturns from time
	to time, our net revenue and earnings may fluctuate significantly, which in turn could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.






	Because our business is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for independent testing and assembly services, any downturn in the highly cyclical semiconductor
	industry may reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our results of operations. All of our customers operate in this industry and variations in order levels from our customers and in service fee rates may result in volatility in our net
	revenue and earnings. For instance, during periods of decreased demand for assembled semiconductors, some of our customers may even simplify, delay or forego final testing of certain types of semiconductors, such as dynamic random access memory or
	DRAM, further intensifying our difficulties. From time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant, and sometimes prolonged, downturns which have adversely affected our results of operations. In 2009, the semiconductor industry,
	especially the assembly and testing services for DRAM products sector, continued to experience the significant downturn that began in fourth quarter of 2008, which adversely affected our business. As a result of the industry downturn, our net
	revenue for 2009 decreased 29% from 2008 levels. This industry downturn started to recover from the second quarter of 2009, and our net revenue for 2010 increased 42% from 2009 levels. Our net revenue for 2011 increased 6% from 2010 levels and
	generated a net loss of NT$15 million in 2011. We cannot give any assurances that there will not be any downturn in the future or that any future downturn will not affect our results of operations.






	Any deterioration in the market for end-user applications for semiconductor products would reduce demand for our services and may result in a
	decrease in our earnings.






	Market conditions in the semiconductor industry track, to a large degree, those for their end-user
	applications. Any deterioration in the market conditions for the end-user applications of semiconductors we test and assemble could reduce demand for our services and, in turn, materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
	operations. Our net revenue is largely attributable to fees derived from testing and assembling semiconductors for use in personal computers, communications equipment, consumer electronic products and display applications. A significant decrease in
	demand for products in these markets could put pricing pressure on our testing and assembly services and negatively affect our net revenue and earnings. Weak demand for LCD and other flat-panel display products began in 2007 and adversely affected
	our operating results in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The LCD driver market started to recover in the second quarter of 2009 and the positive recovery trend continued in 2010 and 2011. We cannot give any assurances that there will not be any downturn in
	the future or that any future downturn will not affect our results of operations. Any significant decrease in demand for end-user applications of semiconductors will negatively affect our net revenue and earnings.






	A decline in average selling prices for our services could result in a decrease in our earnings.






	Historically, prices for our testing and assembly services in relation to any given semiconductor tend to decline over the course of its product and
	technology life cycle. See also A decrease in market demand for LCD and

	other flat-panel display driver semiconductors may adversely affect our capacity utilization rates and thereby negatively affect our profitability. If we cannot reduce the cost of our
	testing and assembly services, or introduce higher-margin testing and assembly services for new package types, to offset the decrease in average selling prices for our services, our earnings could decrease.






	A reversal or slowdown in the outsourcing trend for semiconductor testing and assembly services could reduceour profitability.






	In recent years, integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, have increasingly outsourced stages of the semiconductor production process, including testing
	and assembly, to independent companies like us to shorten production cycles. In addition, the availability of advanced independent semiconductor manufacturing services has also enabled the growth of so-called fabless semiconductor
	companies that focus exclusively on design and marketing and outsource their manufacturing, testing and assembly requirements to independent companies. A substantial portion of our net revenue is indirectly generated from providing semiconductor
	assembly and testing services to these IDMs and fabless companies. We cannot assure you that these companies will continue to outsource their testing and assembly requirements to independent companies like us. A reversal of, or a slowdown in, this
	outsourcing trend could result in reduced demand for our services, which in turn could reduce our profitability.

	ThaiLin Semiconductor Corp. has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional
	             common shares to cover overallotments, if any. If this option is exercised in full, the number of common shares owned by ThaiLin after this offering shall be

	ThaiLin Semiconductor Corp. (ThaiLin).


	ThaiLin was incorporated in Taiwan in May 1996 and is listed
	on the GreTai Securities Market in Taiwan. It is engaged in providing semiconductor testing services.




	We have an indirect interest in
	ThaiLin. As of September 30, 2012, ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC., or ChipMOS Taiwan, our 84.2% owned subsidiary held 104.7 million shares of ThaiLin, comprising 42.9% of the outstanding shares in ThaiLin (which does not include 11 million
	shares of ThaiLin pledged to ChipMOS Taiwan by another shareholder of ThaiLin). These shares were primarily acquired by ChipMOS Taiwan in December 2002. Under applicable accounting principles, ThaiLin was consolidated into our consolidated financial
	statements in 2003 because ChipMOS Taiwan was deemed to exert significant control over ThaiLin through common directors and management. Mr. Shih-Jye Cheng, our chairman and chief executive officer and the director and chairman of ChipMOS
	Taiwan, is also a director and the chairman of ThaiLin. In addition, four of the nine directors of ThaiLin are appointed by ChipMOS Taiwan.




	As of September 30, 2012, ThaiLin held 6,474,211 of our issued and outstanding common shares, corresponding to 19.1% of all of our issued and
	outstanding common shares. ThaiLins current holding includes 1,015,158 shares acquired in 2009 pursuant to ThaiLins enforcement of its rights under a stock pledge agreement with another shareholder; 506,364 shares accumulated from
	purchases under a Rule 10b5-1/10b-18 securities purchase program during December 2008 to August 2009; and 4,952,689 shares acquired in 2010 and 2011 pursuant to convertible notes issued by us to ThaiLin in 2009.






	Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. (Siliconware Precision).


	Siliconware Precision was incorporated in Taiwan in May
	1984, and is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. It is engaged in the assembly, testing and turnkey services of integrated circuits.

	Siliconware Precision acquired 3,043,749 of our newly issued common shares in a private placement share
	purchase and subscription transaction completed on March 27, 2007. As part of that transaction, we and ChipMOS Taiwan purchased all of Siliconware Precisions equity interest in ChipMOS Taiwan. In February 2010, we agreed to sell 15.8% of
	ChipMOS Taiwans outstanding shares to Siliconware Precision, which share purchase transaction was completed in January 2011.




	As of
	September 30, 2012, Siliconware Precision held 3,043,749 of our issued and outstanding common shares, corresponding to 9.0% of all of our issued and outstanding common shares, and Siliconware Precision also held 15.8% of ChipMOS Taiwans
	outstanding shares.

	UNDERWRITING





	We, the selling shareholders and the underwriters for the offering named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the common
	shares being offered and sold by the selling shareholders. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase from the selling shareholders the number of common shares set forth
	opposite its name below.

	Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC





	  









	Total





	  









	  



	 






	The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters are subject to certain conditions precedent
	and that the underwriters have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the shares sold under the underwriting agreement if any of these shares are purchased, other than those shares covered by the overallotment option described below.
	If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.




	We and the selling shareholders have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
	and to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect thereof.




	The underwriters are offering the shares, subject
	to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel and other conditions specified in the underwriting agreement. The underwriters reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify
	offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.





	Overallotment option to purchase additional shares





	ThaiLin has granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up
	to                    additional common shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. This option is exercisable for a period
	of 30 days. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering overallotments, if any, made in connection with the sale of common shares offered hereby. To the extent that the underwriters exercise this option, the
	underwriters will purchase additional shares from ThaiLin in approximately the same proportion as shown in the table above.





	Discounts and
	commissions





	The following table shows the public offering price, underwriting discount and proceeds, before expenses, to the selling
	shareholders. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares.

	Table of Contents




	The underwriters propose to offer the common shares to the public at the public offering price set forth on
	the cover of this prospectus supplement. The underwriters may offer the common shares to securities dealers at the public offering price less a concession not in excess of US$            
	per share. If all of the shares are not sold at the public offering price, the underwriters may change the offering price and other selling terms.




	We and the selling shareholders estimate that the total expenses of this offering, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately
	US$            . ThaiLin has agreed to reimburse us, on a pro-rata basis, for certain of our expenses in connection with this offering. ThaiLin has also agreed to reimburse the underwriters
	for certain of their fees and expenses in connection with this offering in an amount not to exceed US$             in the aggregate.





	Discretionary accounts





	The underwriters
	do not intend to confirm sales of the shares to any accounts over which they have discretionary authority.





	Stabilization





	In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, overallotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions,
	penalty bids and purchases to cover positions created by short sales.



	 





	 




	




	 





	Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase common shares so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum, and are engaged in
	for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common shares while the offering is in progress.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Overallotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of common shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to
	purchase. This creates a syndicate short position which may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of shares
	that they may purchase in the overallotment option. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the overallotment option. The underwriters may close out any short position by exercising their
	overallotment option and/or purchasing shares in the open market.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
	syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which
	they may purchase shares through exercise of the overallotment option. If the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the overallotment option and, therefore, have a naked short position, the position can be closed out
	only by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market that could adversely
	affect investors who purchase in the offering.







	Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a
	syndicate member when the common shares originally sold by that syndicate member are purchased in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions to cover syndicate short positions.




	These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common shares or preventing or retarding a decline in
	the market price of our common shares. As a result, the price of our common shares in the open market may be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. Neither we, the selling shareholders nor the underwriters make




	 




	S-37








	Table of Contents




	any representation or prediction as to the effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of our common shares. These transactions may be effected on the NASDAQ Capital
	Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.





	Passive market making





	In connection with this offering, underwriters and selling group members may engage in passive market making transactions in our common
	shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market in accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of common shares and extending through the completion of the distribution. A
	passive market maker must display its bid at a price not in excess of the highest independent bid of that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market makers bid, that bid must then be lowered when specified
	purchase limits are exceeded.





	Lock-up agreements





	The selling shareholders have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any transaction that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition of
	any common shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common shares or derivatives of our common shares owned by these persons prior to this offering or common shares issuable upon exercise of options or
	warrants held by these persons for a period of at least 60 days after the date of this prospectus supplement without the prior written consent of the underwriters, subject to a potential extension of the lock-up period for up to an additional 18
	days under certain circumstances. This consent may be given at any time without public notice. There are no agreements between the underwriters and the selling shareholders releasing them from these lock-up agreements prior to the expiration of the
	up to 60-day period.




	We and our directors and executive officers have agreed that, without the prior written consent of the underwriters, for
	a period of 60 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, subject to a potential extension of the lock-up period for up to an additional 18 days under certain circumstances we and our directors and executive directors will not, directly or
	indirectly:

	offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device which is designed to, or could be expected to, result in
	the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (other than common shares issued pursuant to (a) employee benefit plans, qualified share option plans
	or other employee compensation plans existing on the date of this prospectus supplement, (b) the conversion of our convertible notes or (c) currently outstanding options, warrants or rights) or sell or grant options, rights or warrants
	with respect to any common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (other than the grant of options pursuant to option plans existing on the date of this prospectus supplement); or






	 





	 




	




	 





	enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership
	of our common shares.







	There are no agreements between the underwriters and us releasing us or our directors and executive
	directors from these lock-up arrangements prior to the expiration of the 60-day period. The consent of the underwriters, if any, may be provided at any time without public notice.





	Electronic offer, sale and distribution of shares





	A prospectus supplement in electronic
	format may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering and one or more of the underwriters participating in this offering may distribute prospectus
	supplements electronically. The underwriters

	ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES





	We are incorporated in Bermuda and a majority of our directors and most of our officers are not residents of the United States. A substantial portion of
	our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to serve notice of a lawsuit on us or our directors and officers within the United States. Because most of our assets are located outside of the
	United States, it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce in the United States judgments of United States courts in any action, including actions based upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.




	Appleby, our Bermuda counsel, has advised us that there is some uncertainty as to the enforcement in Bermuda, in original actions or in
	actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts, of liabilities predicated upon United States federal securities laws.




	Our
	corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association, our bye-laws and laws governing companies incorporated in Bermuda. Shareholder suits such as class actions (as these terms are understood with respect to corporations incorporated in
	the United States) are generally not available in Bermuda. Therefore, our shareholders may be less able under Bermuda law than they would be under the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions to protect their interests in connection with
	actions by our management, members of our board of directors or our controlling shareholders.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS





	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, using a shelf
	registration process. Under the shelf registration process, the selling shareholders may sell in one or more offerings pursuant to this registration statement up to 2,500,000 of our common shares. This prospectus provides you with a general
	description of our common shares. We will provide updated information if required whenever the selling shareholders offer our common shares pursuant to this prospectus. This may include a prospectus supplement that will describe the specific
	amounts, prices and terms of the offered common shares. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change the information contained in this prospectus. Before purchasing any of the shares, you should carefully read both this prospectus and
	any supplement thereof, together with the additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find More Information About Us and Incorporation of Documents by Reference.

	SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	This prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the information incorporated herein and therein by reference may contain
	forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain estimates,
	assumptions, projections and/or expectations regarding future events, which may or may not occur. Words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend,
	may, plan, potential, should, will, would, or similar expressions, which refer to future events and trends, identify forward-looking statements. For instance, we make
	forward-looking statements such as our expected manufacturing capacity, our ability to successfully develop new technologies and remain a technological leader, our ability to maintain control over capacity expansion and facility modifications and or
	our ability to generate growth or profitable growth. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement will happen as described or that they will happen at all. You should read this
	prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement completely and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. The forward-looking statements made in this prospectus and any accompanying
	prospectus supplement relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation, beyond that required by law, to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which
	the statement is made, even though our situation may change in the future. Whether actual results will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and reflect
	future business decisions that are subject to change. Some of the assumptions, future results and levels of performance expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements we make inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events may
	occur which will affect our results. The Risk Factors section of this prospectus and any prospectus supplement that may be filed directs you to a description of the principal contingencies and uncertainties to which we believe we are
	subject.




	This prospectus also contains or incorporates by reference data related to the semiconductor market in several countries, including
	China. These market data, including industry demand and product pricing, include projections that are based on a number of assumptions. Demand for the end-user applications for semiconductor products; and or capacity in the semiconductor testing and
	assembly markets may not ultimately develop or increase at the rates and trend expected, or at all. The failure of the market to develop at the projected rates may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and the market
	price of our shares. In addition, the volatility of the semiconductor industry and the current economic conditions subjects any projections or estimates relating to the growth prospects or future condition of our market to significant uncertainties.
	If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data proves to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

	DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL









	Description of Share Capital





	Our authorized share capital is US$3,250,000 consists of 62,500,000 common shares of par value US$0.04 per share, and 18,750,000 preferred shares of par value US$0.04 per share.





	Common Shares





	Each
	shareholder is entitled to one vote for each common share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. Cumulative voting for the election of directors is not provided for in our bye-laws, which means that the holders of a majority of the
	shares voted can elect all of the directors then standing for election. The common shares are not entitled to preemptive rights and are not subject to conversion or redemption. Upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the
	holders of common shares would be entitled to share ratably in the distribution of all of our assets remaining available for distribution after satisfaction of all liabilities.





	Preferred Shares





	Currently there are no specific rights attached to the preferred shares. The specific rights of the preferred shares could include rights, preferences or
	privileges in priority to our common shares and the establishment of such rights or the delegation to the board of directors to establish such rights will need to be approved by our shareholders. As of September 30, 2012, no preferred shares
	have been issued by our company.





	Share Option Plan and Share Appreciation Rights Plan





	We have both a share option plan and a share appreciation rights plan in respect of our common shares. In the description below, the figures have been
	adjusted to reflect the Companys 1-for-every-4 reverse stock split on January 21, 2011.




	We adopted a broad-based share option plan
	in 2001, which was amended at a special general meeting on March 19, 2004 to increase the number of common shares of par value US$0.04 each available for issuance under the share option plan from 1,450,000 to 2,250,000. In August 2006, we
	adopted a second broad-based share option plan, which has 1,750,000 common shares of par value US$0.04 each available for issuance. In September 2011, we adopted a third broad-based share option plan, which has 1,000,000 shares of par value US$0.04
	each available for issuance. Each share option plan provides that our directors, officers, employees and those of our affiliates may, at the discretion of our board of directors or a committee, be granted options to purchase our shares at an
	exercise price of no less than the par value of our common shares. The board or the committee has complete discretion to determine which eligible individuals are to receive option grants, the number of shares subject to each grant, the exercise
	price of all options granted, the vesting schedule to be in effect for each option grant and the maximum term for which each granted option is to remain outstanding, up to a maximum term of ten years. Shares available for issuance under these plans
	are replenished by shares that were subject to forfeited and expired share options.




	In 2009, we granted 494,394 share options, with an
	exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$0.8528 to US$2.55 per share. In 2009, 174,295 share options were forfeited, 96,250 share options were expired and nil share options were exercised. In 2010, we granted 160,660 share options, with
	an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$2.448 to US$5.474 per share. In 2010, 212,049 share options were forfeited, 353,800 share options were expired and 19,246 share options were exercised. In 2011, we granted 692,624 share
	options, with an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$4.59 to US$6.222 per share. In 2011, 148,403 share options were forfeited, nil share options were expired and 96,103 share options were exercised. As of December 31, 2011,
	we had 2,562,172 share options outstanding, with an exercise price ranging from US$0.748 to US$25.908.

	Table of Contents




	In September 2006 and August 2008, we adopted a share appreciation rights (SARs) plan pursuant
	to which we may issue up 500,000 and 750,000 cash-settled SARs to our directors, officers, employees and those of our affiliates. Under the share appreciation rights plan, each holder of SARs, issued thereunder will be entitled to receive, on the
	applicable exercise date, cash in an amount equal to the excess of the market value of our common shares on such date over the exercise price of such rights. Our board of directors or a relevant committee thereof has complete discretion over the
	administration of the share appreciation rights plan, including determining the recipients of the share appreciation right awards, the number of rights awarded, the exercise date, the exercise price and other relevant terms. Unless earlier
	terminated by our board of directors or the relevant board committee, the plan will remain effective until September 2016 and August 2018. In 2009, 293,265 SARs were granted, with an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$0.884 to
	US$2.55. In 2009, 51,165 SARs were forfeited and no SARs were exercised. In 2010, 18,625 SARs were granted, with an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$2.448 to US$3.06. In 2010, 89,300 SARs were forfeited and 15,300 SARS were
	exercised. In 2011, 525,885 SARs were granted, with an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$5.151 to US$6.222. In 2011, 70,621 SARs were forfeited and 32,832 SARs were exercised. As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,049,939 SARs
	outstanding, with an exercise price, at the time of grant, ranging from US$0.748 to US$25.908.





	Bermuda Law





	We are an exempted company organized under the Bermuda Companies Act. The rights of our shareholders are governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of
	association and bye-laws. The Bermuda Companies Act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. For example, shareholder suits such as class actions (as these terms are
	understood with respect to corporations incorporated in the United States) are generally not available in Bermuda.





	Dividends





	Under Bermuda
	law, a company may pay dividends that are declared from time to time by its board of directors unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or
	that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities, issued share capital and share premium accounts. The holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally available for
	such purposes at times and in amounts as our board of directors may from time to time determine. Any dividend unclaimed for a period of six years from its date of declaration will be forfeited and will revert to our company.





	Voting Rights





	Under
	Bermuda law, except as otherwise provided in the Bermuda Companies Act or our bye-laws, questions brought before a general meeting of shareholders are decided by a majority vote of shareholders present at the meeting. Our bye-laws provide that,
	subject to the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act, and except for the resolutions for approving the extraordinary transaction, any question properly proposed for the consideration of the shareholders will be decided by a simple majority of the
	votes cast, either on a show of hands or on a poll, with each shareholder present (and each person holding proxies for any shareholder) entitled to one vote on a show of hands, or on a poll, one vote for each fully paid-up common share held by the
	shareholder. In the case of an equality of votes cast, the chairman of the meeting shall have a second or casting vote. Any resolution for any of the following extraordinary transactions will require the approval of shareholders holding at least
	70.0% of the total voting rights of all the shareholders having the right to vote at such meeting:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a resolution for the merger, amalgamation or any other consolidation of us with any other company, wherever incorporated;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a resolution for the sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	a resolution for the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation of our company.

	Rights in Liquidation





	Under Bermuda law, in the event of liquidation or winding-up of a company, after satisfaction in full of all claims of creditors and subject to the preferential rights accorded to any series of preferred
	shares, the proceeds of the liquidation or winding-up are distributed pro rata in species or in kind among the holders of our common shares in accordance with our bye-laws.





	Meetings of Shareholders





	Under Bermuda law, a company is required to convene at least one
	general shareholders meeting as an Annual General Meeting each calendar year, unless according to the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act, shareholders elect to dispense with the holding of annual general meeting. Bermuda law provides that
	a special general meeting may be called by the board of directors and must be called upon the request of shareholders holding not less than 10% of the paid-up capital of the company carrying the right to vote. Bermuda law also requires that
	shareholders be given at least five days advance notice of a general meeting but the accidental omission to give notice to any person does not invalidate the proceedings at a meeting. Under our bye-laws, we must give each shareholder written
	notice at least five days prior to the annual general meeting, unless otherwise agreed by all shareholders having the right to vote at that annual general meeting, and written notice at least five days prior to any special general meeting, unless
	otherwise agreed by a majority of shareholders having a right to vote at that special general meeting, and together holding at least 95% of the paid-up capital of the company carrying the right to vote at that meeting.




	Under Bermuda law, the number of shareholders constituting a quorum at any general meeting of shareholders is determined by the
	bye-laws of the company. Our bye-laws provide that at least two shareholders present in person or by proxy and holding shares representing at least 50% of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting constitute
	a quorum. Our bye-laws further provide that, in respect of a general meeting adjourned for lack of quorum, at least two shareholders present in person or by proxy holding shares representing 33


	 1



	/



	3



	% of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting constitute a quorum.






	Access to Books and Records and Dissemination of Information





	Under Bermuda law, members of
	the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of a company available at the office of the Bermuda Registrar. These documents include a companys certificate of incorporation, its memorandum of association (including its
	objects and powers), and any alteration to its memorandum of association and documents relating to an increase or reduction of authorized share capital. The shareholders have the additional right to inspect the bye-laws of the company, minutes of
	general meetings and the companys audited financial statements, which, unless agreed by all shareholders and directors, must be laid before the annual general meeting. The register of shareholders of a company is also open to inspection by
	shareholders and by members of the general public for not less than two hours each day without charge. Any member of the public may require a copy of the register, or of any part thereof, on the payment of a fee. A company is required to maintain
	its share register in Bermuda but may, subject to the provisions of Bermuda law, establish a branch register outside Bermuda. We maintain a share register in Hamilton, Bermuda and a branch register in New Jersey, USA. A company is required to keep
	at its registered office a register of its directors and officers which is open for inspection for not less than two hours each day by members of the public without charge. Bermuda law does not, however, provide a general right for shareholders to
	inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records.





	Election or Removal of Directors





	Under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, directors are elected or appointed at an annual general meeting and serve until re-elected or re-appointed or until
	their successors are elected or appointed, unless they are earlier removed for cause or resign or otherwise cease to be directors under Bermuda law or our bye-laws.




	 




	5








	Table of Contents




	A director may be removed for cause at a special general meeting of shareholders specifically called for
	that purpose, provided that the director is served with at least 14 days notice. The director has a right to be heard at that meeting. Any vacancy created by the removal of a director at a special general meeting may be filled at that meeting
	by the election of another director in his or her place or, in the absence of any election by the shareholders, by the board of directors.





	Board Actions





	Our bye-laws provide that the quorum necessary for the transaction of
	business is two individual directors of the board, and that questions arising at a properly convened meeting of the board of directors must be approved by a majority of the votes present and entitled to be cast. In the case of an equality of votes,
	the chairman of the meeting is entitled to a second or casting vote.




	The board of directors may appoint any of our directors to act as our
	managing director or other senior executive, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, including with respect to remuneration.





	Amendment of Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws





	Bermuda law provides that the
	memorandum of association of a company may, with the consent of the Minister of Finance of Bermuda (if required), be amended by a resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders of which due notice has been given. Our bye-laws, other than the
	bye-law separating our board of directors into three classes, may be amended by the board of directors if the amendment is approved by a majority of votes cast by our directors and by our shareholders by a resolution passed by a majority of votes
	cast at a general meeting. Any amendment to our bye-law separating a board of directors into three classes must be approved by our board of directors and by shareholders holding shares representing at least 60% of the total voting rights of all our
	shareholders having the right to vote at such general meeting.




	Under Bermuda law, the holders of an aggregate of no less than 20% in par
	value of a companys issued share capital or any class of issued share capital have the right to apply to the Bermuda Court for an annulment of any amendment of the memorandum of association adopted by shareholders at any general meeting. Where
	an application is made, the amendment becomes effective only to the extent that it is confirmed by the Bermuda Court. An application for the annulment of an amendment of the memorandum of association must be made within 21 days after the date on
	which the resolution altering the companys memorandum of association is passed and may be made on behalf of the person entitled to make the application by one or more of their number as they may appoint in writing for the purpose. No
	application may be made by persons voting in favor of the amendment.





	Appraisal Rights and Shareholder Suits





	Under Bermuda law, in the event of an amalgamation or a merger of two Bermuda companies, a shareholder who did not vote in favour of the
	amalgamation or the merger and who is not satisfied that fair value has been paid for such shareholders shares may apply to the Bermuda Court to appraise the fair value of those shares. The Bermuda Companies Act provides that, subject to the
	terms of a companys bye-laws, the amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with another company requires the amalgamation or merger agreement to be approved by the board of directors and, except where the amalgamation or merger is between a
	holding company and one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries or between two or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, by meetings of the holders of shares of each company and of each class of such shares at a meeting of the shareholders by seventy-five
	percent of the members present and entitled to vote at that meeting in respect of which the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing at least one-third of the issued shares of each company or class, as the case may be. Under our bye-laws,
	any resolution proposed for consideration at any general meeting to approve the merger, amalgamation or any other consolidation of our company with any other

	company, wherever incorporated shall require the approval of our shareholders holding shares representing at least 70% of the total voting rights of all our shareholders, and the quorum to be at
	least two shareholders present in person or by proxy holdings shares representing at least 50% of the total voting rights of all our shareholders.




	Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law. The Bermuda Court, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action
	in the name of a company to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or is illegal or would result in the violation of the companys memorandum of association or
	bye-laws. Further consideration would be given by the Bermuda Court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the companys
	shareholders than that which actually approved it.




	When the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to
	the interests of some part of the shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Bermuda Court for an order regulating the companys conduct of affairs in the future or compelling the purchase of the shares by any shareholder, by other
	shareholders or by the company.

	underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act. Any commission received by such broker-dealers or agent on the sales and any profit on the resale of share purchased by broker-dealers or agent may be deemed to be underwriting
	commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. As a result, we have informed the selling shareholders that Regulation M, promulgated under the Exchange Act, may apply to sales by the selling shareholders in the market. The selling
	shareholders may agree to indemnify any broker, dealer or agent that participates in transactions involving the sale of our common shares against certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.

	supplement and have informed the selling shareholders of the need to deliver copies of this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement to purchasers prior to any sale to them.




	The selling shareholders may also sell all or a portion of our common shares in open market transactions under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act including transactions in accordance with Rule 144
	promulgated thereunder, rather than under the shelf registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.




	Pursuant to a requirement
	by The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, the maximum commission or discount to be received by any FINRA member or independent broker/dealer may not be greater than eight percent (8%) of the gross proceeds received by the
	selling shareholders for the sale of any securities being registered pursuant to SEC Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.





	Sale through Underwriters or Dealers





	The Company and the selling shareholders intend to enter into an underwriting agreement with an underwriter with respect to the timing, price, manner and
	size of each sale by the selling shareholders. If underwriters are used in the sale, the underwriters will acquire the shares for their own account, including through underwriting, purchase, security lending or repurchase agreements with us and the
	selling shareholders. The underwriters may resell the shares from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. Underwriters may sell the shares in order to facilitate transactions in any of our other securities
	(described in this prospectus or otherwise), including other public or private transactions and short sales. Underwriters may offer the shares to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or
	directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the shares will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be
	obligated to purchase all the offered shares if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.




	If dealers are used in the sale of shares offered through this prospectus, the selling shareholders will sell the shares to them as principals. They may
	then resell those shares to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. The applicable prospectus supplement will include the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction.





	General Information





	Agents,
	underwriters, and dealers may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us, to indemnification by us, against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our agents, underwriters, and dealers, or their affiliates, may
	be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us or our affiliates, in the ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary compensation.
