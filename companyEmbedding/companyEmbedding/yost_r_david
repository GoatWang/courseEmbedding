      ■ Healthcare manufacturing administrator R. David
      "Dave" Yost was the chief executive officer and a member of
      the board of directors of the healthcare, biotechnology, and drug company
      AmerisourceBergen Corporation, an organization based in Chesterbrook,
      Pennsylvania. With 30 years of experience in various sales, operations,
      and management positions within the pharmaceutical distribution field,
      Yost in the early 2000s was one of the country's most respected
      leaders in the health-care services industry.
    

      LEADING PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTOR
    

      AmerisourceBergen was the world's leading wholesale distributor of
      pharmaceutical products and one of the country's
    




           Dave Yost.

          . 
        


      largest pharmaceutical services companies, along with associated services
      to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, in the early
      2000s. Specifically, the company provided pharmaceutical distribution and
      other services throughout the United States to managed-care facilities,
      hospitals, drugstores and chain retail pharmacies, nursing homes and
      assisted-living centers, mail-order facilities, physicians, super-markets,
      clinics, and mass merchandisers from about 38 distribution centers. It
      also provided pharmaceuticals to long-term care, workers'
      compensation, and specialty drug patients. The company distributed
      primarily generic, branded, biotechnology and specialty drugs and
      over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, but it also offered beauty and health
      aids, medical supplies, toiletries, and sundries. AmerisourceBergen had
      14,800 employees as of September 2003.
    

      PharMerica, the company's subsidiary, was one of the largest U.S.
      providers of pharmaceuticals, infusion therapy (the
       practice of administering liquids through a drip feed), and other
      services to long-term and residential facilities. It also delivered
      pharmaceuticals and provided services through 125 institutional pharmacies
      that served 300,000 patients in 40 states.
    

      FLYING UP THE CORPORATE LADDER
    

      Yost graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1969. He served as an
      active-duty member of the United States Air Force from 1969 to 1974 and
      eventually attained the rank of captain. In 1970 Yost earned his MBA
      degree from the University of California at Los Angeles. After leaving the
      Air Force in 1974, Yost joined the Columbus, Ohio-based Kauffman-Lattimer
      Company—an AmeriSource predecessor firm—in a variety of
      operational, sales, and executive positions including cochief operating
      officer, executive vice president of operations, and president. In 1989
      Yost began working for Alco Health Systems Corporation, formerly
      associated with Kauffman-Lattimer, that was based in Malvern,
      Pennsylvania. In 1989 Alco Standard spun off Alco Health Services; the
      newly formed company increased its sales dramatically through key
      acquisitions and expanded product lines and went public as AmeriSource
      Health Corporation in 1995. During this period of expansion, Yost held the
      positions of group vice president and group president of the central
      region.
    

      In 1995 Yost became executive vice president of operations for Malvern,
      Pennsylvania-based AmeriSource Health Corporation. Two years later, in May
      1997, Yost was promoted to president and CEO and remained as president
      until December 2000, at which time he added the position of chairman.
      During this period (1998) he led a reorganization of AmeriSource after the
      U.S. Federal Trade Commission blocked a proposed merger with McKesson
      Corporation.
    

      FIRST PRESIDENT AND CEO OF NEWLY MERGED COMPANY
    

      AmeriSource Health Corporation and Orange, California-based Bergen
      Brunswig Corporation merged on August 29, 2001, in a $7 billion deal. Yost
      became the president, CEO, and a member of the board of directors of the
      new company, which was called AmerisourceBergen Corporation. At the time
      of the merger, Yost felt that the coming together of the two
      service-oriented companies would provide many new kinds of services and
      programs for its customers along with saving the new company about $125
      million to $150 million annually in synergies, or combined efforts, mostly
      from a consolidation of its distribution centers. He remained as
      AmerisourceBergen's president until October 2002, then continued as
      CEO and director.
    

      SIMPLE, SINGLE FOCUS
    

      As the new head of the largest purchaser of generic drugs in the United
      States, Yost began to concentrate on improving AmerisourceBergen's
      position in the pharmaceutical supply sector by bringing new and
      innovative products and services to its customers and increasing
      efficiencies throughout its giant distribution network. Yost committed
      himself to the company's only agenda: dedicating itself to the
      distribution business within the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.
      In fact, Yost believed AmericsourceBergen differentiated itself from its
      competitors (such as Cardinal Health, McKesson, and Owens & Minor)
      by 
      
        not
      
       competing with its customers in services to the end user. And with this
      simple focus, Yost promoted the idea throughout his organization about how
      to make its retailers more competitive in the market, how to increase
      their revenues, cut their costs, and improve their margins.
    

      MAXIMIZED EFFICIENCY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
    

      With $36 billion in projected annual revenues in 2001 and operations in
      almost every U.S. state, Yost was given the job of improving the
      company's overall efficiency while focusing on customer service
      throughout its 25,000 chain and independent pharmacies, as well as
      thousands of hospitals, nursing homes, and mail-order pharmacies. Yost
      began this strenuous task in a number of different key areas.
    

      Yost used a unique, decentralized organizational structure that dealt with
      national sales at the distribution-center level. In fact, Yost made sure
      that customer service was handled at the operating-unit level, the level
      closest to the customer, which was managed by Yost's team of
      regional vice presidents and general managers. This management team had
      final decision-making authority to handle most customer situations that
      arose within its region. While Yost talked with these vice presidents on a
      weekly basis, his chief operating officer talked with them every business
      day. While this was happening, the vice presidents, who had years of
      experience at their jobs, were talking with the customers on a daily
      basis.
    

      Although Yost dealt with customers in a decentralized arrangement, he
      implemented a technology-based program for centralized procurement, data
      processing, and other administrative functions throughout his operational
      structure in order to achieve greater efficiencies. Yost integrated this
      technology so that tens of thousands of customers could easily and
      effort-lessly submit millions of daily transactions into its nationwide
      system. Such technology included order-entry platforms, automated
      receivables accounting systems, and warehouse management systems. With
      such an infrastructure, Yost wanted to respond rapidly to deliveries,
      improve warehouse efficiencies to a just-in-time model (where products are
      left in warehouses for a minimal amount of time), and provide greater
      forecasting of product demands, all without sacrificing customer service.
    

      Yost also dealt with the two well-established drugstore membership buying
      and marketing programs—Bergen's Good Neighbor Pharmacy and
      AmeriSource's Family Pharmacy—that together had about 4,000
      independently owned drug stores. He combined the two programs into one
      unified, data-driven package that reduced the increasingly heavy workloads
      of its pharmacists. Yost also expanded many of the services offered by its
      pharmacies, including a diabetic-care business.
    

      Yost reduced the number of the company's distribution centers from
      52 in 2001 (at the time of the company's merger) to 38 in 2003, and
      projected to reduce them further to 30 by 2007 in an effort to become as
      efficient as possible. The average AmeriSource center, according to Yost,
      handled about $700 million a year in products in 2001, but, now in 2003,
      took care of more than $2 billion per year. These increased levels of
      activities were also enhanced with the use of new robotic machines and
      computer systems that could handle many more products involving advanced,
      state-of-the-art automation; paperless ordering, picking up, and tracking;
      and faster turnaround. Yost also predicted at that time that errors would
      be greatly reduced with such efficiency efforts.
    

      EXPANSION PLANS
    

      In 2002 Yost directed AmerisourceBergen through several major
      acquisitions. He began to acquire smaller drug companies related to, but
      outside, its core business area in order to strengthen the
      company's position in the pharmaceutical supply chain with regards
      to both customers and suppliers. Yost specifically stayed away from
      billion-dollar purchases, but instead concentrated on acquisitions in the
      $100 million to $200 million range that he thought would help earnings in
      the most efficient way possible.
    

      In July 2002 Yost acquired the Chicago, Illinois-based AutoMed
      Technologies for $120 million. Yost bought the company in order to use its
      automated drug dispensing system to lower AmerisourceBergen's costs
      for dispensing drugs in pharmacies. With only about 10 percent of retail
      pharmacies and fewer than 50 percent of outpatient hospital pharmacies
      using automation, Yost planned to employ AutoMed's software,
      equipment, and workflow design to automate pharmacy dispensing equipment
      throughout AmeriSource.
    

      Yost signed an order for his intent to purchase Bridge Medical, a company
      based in Solana Beach, California, in December 2002. He intended to take
      advantage of the company's barcode-enabled, point-of-care software,
      a bedside scanning system that coordinated the correct medication with a
      patient's bar-coded wristband. The base price for the acquisition
      of Bridge Medical was $27 million, with an incentive option of up to $55
      million depending on future earnings. Yost liked the company because its
      products helped to reduce medication errors and, as a result, decreased
      the costs of the company's healthcare facilities while increasing
      their operating efficiencies.
    

      The third purchase brokered by Yost was of the Washington, D.C.-based U.S.
      Bioservices Corporation, a $160 million-plus deal made in January 2003.
      Bioservices, with 2002 revenues of about $125 million, was a specialty
      pharmaceutical services company that distributed complicated medications
      for such diseases as AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), cancer,
      multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis C to patients across the country. The
      reason that Yost purchased Bioservices was to expand
      AmerisourceBergen's ability to support pharmaceutical manufacturers
      with complicated products that targeted small markets, such as in the
      biotechnology arena.
    

      Yost continued his acquisition activities with the June 2003 agreement to
      purchase Anderson Packaging, a privately held, contract pharmaceutical
      packaging company headquartered in Rockford, Illinois. The complete
      purchase amount totaled $100 million, including assumed debt of about $18
      million. In the early part of 2004, Yost brokered a deal to buy
      Alpharetta, Georgia-based MedSelect, a privately held provider of
      automated medication and supply dispensing cabinets, for $13.4 million,
      including assumed debt.
    

      TWO-YEAR RESULTS
    

      Within a year of taking the helm, Yost proudly declared that
      AmerisourceBergen's management team had progressed greatly with
      integrating its service programs, establishing a common technology
      platform in many of its pharmacies, and raising the amount of use of its
      programs among its customers. After about two years of streamlining
      activities, acquisitions, and improved technology within its services,
      Yost reported total revenues for AmerisourceBergen of $49.7 billion in
      2003, a 10 percent increase over 2002, and a net income of $441.2 million,
      a 27.9 percent increase over 2002. With a 25 percent share of the U.S.
      drug-distribution market, Yost positioned AmerisourceBergen as a major
      player in the healthcare, biotechnology, and drug industry.

 SuccessorVALLEY FORGE, Pa., Mar 14, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) --AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced that Chief 
      Executive Officer R. David Yost will retire from the Company on July 1, 
      2011. The AmerisourceBergen Board of Directors has named Steven H. 
      Collis, age 49, to succeed Yost, also effective July 1, 2011.

"Ten years after we announced the merger that created AmerisourceBergen, 
      I am announcing my plans to retire," said Yost. "With our strong 
      position in the growth areas of the pharmaceutical supply chain, 
      generics and specialty pharmaceuticals, I believe the Company is 
      exceptionally well-positioned for continued success, and that the 
      Company's future has never been brighter. With Steve's leadership, I am 
      confident that AmerisourceBergen will take full advantage of the 
      opportunities that lie ahead."

"On a personal note, I am almost 64 years old and have been with the 
      Company for almost 37 years, and CEO for 14 years," continued Yost. 
      "There are many things I'd like to do with my wife, my family, and my 
      grandchildren, and other interests I would like to pursue while I am 
      still in good health and I look forward to getting started on that 
      chapter of my life."

"Dave has done a superb job during his 14 years as the Chief Executive 
      Officer of AmerisourceBergen and its predecessor company," said Richard 
      C. Gozon, Chairman of the Board of AmerisourceBergen. "Most notably, he 
      has developed a very talented and results-oriented management team. The 
      Board of Directors has every confidence that under the leadership of 
      Steve Collis, the Company will continue to deliver the outstanding 
      performance that AmerisourceBergen stakeholders have come to expect."

Collis is currently President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible 
      for all AmerisourceBergen business units including AmerisourceBergen 
      Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), 
      AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), and AmerisourceBergen 
      Packaging Group (ABPG). Before being promoted to his current position in 
      November 2010, Collis was Executive Vice President AmerisourceBergen and 
      President of ABDC, the Company's largest subsidiary with revenues over 
      $60 billion. Over his 17 year tenure with the Company, he founded ABSG 
      and was the driving force behind growing the business into the 
      market-leader it is today, with $16 billion in annualized revenues.

"Steve's experience and skills make him eminently qualified to be the 
      next CEO of AmerisourceBergen," said Yost. "The Company has great 
      momentum, a seasoned and proven management team, and a superb 
      customer-focused, cost conscious culture. I have no doubts that Steve 
      will continue to grow our business and provide value to our customers, 
      suppliers, shareholders and our associates."

In addition, the Company reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal year 2011 
      earnings per share in the range of $2.31 to $2.41.

      at 5:00pm Eastern Time today. Participating in the call will be:

      regulations governing the marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceutical 
      products or any related litigation, including shareholder derivative 
      lawsuits; changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory action 
      affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies, 
      including under Medicaid and Medicare; changes in regulatory or clinical 
      medical guidelines and/or labeling for the pharmaceutical products we 
      distribute, including certain anemia products; price inflation in

      than anticipated benefit from launches of the generic versions of 
      previously patented pharmaceutical products; significant breakdown or

      and/or cost overruns; success of integration, restructuring or systems 
      initiatives; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate 
      fluctuations; economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory 
      developments in Canada, the United Kingdom and elsewhere outside of the 
      United States, including changes and/or potential changes in Canadian 
      provincial legislation affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or 
      service fees or regulatory action by provincial authorities in Canada to 
      lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees; the impact of 
      divestitures or the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as we 
      expect or that are difficult for us to integrate or control; our 
      inability to successfully complete any other transaction that we may 
      wish to pursue from time to time; changes in tax legislation or adverse 
      resolution of challenges to our tax positions; increased costs of 
      maintaining, or reductions in our ability to maintain, adequate 
      liquidity and financing sources; volatility and deterioration of the 
      capital and credit markets; and other economic, business, competitive, 
      legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting our business 
      generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could 
      cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those 
      described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A 
      (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
      Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 and elsewhere in that report and 
      (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities

7/1/2011 7:03:53 AM


VALLEY FORGE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC - News), in accordance with its previously announced succession plan, today announced that Steven H. Collis, 50, has been appointed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. Collis succeeds R. David Yost, 63, who retired from his role as Chief Executive Officer and stepped down from the Company’s Board of Directors, effective as of July 1, 2011. 

“On behalf of our entire Company, I thank Dave for his 37 years of extraordinary service to AmerisourceBergen, and for his gracious support during the leadership transition,” said Collis. “I am both humbled and honored to be the leader of such a high-performing Company. I believe with our momentum, our position in growing markets, our talented and seasoned management team, and our dedication to efficiency and innovative customer service, we will continue to drive success by growing our business and providing value to our customers, suppliers, shareholders and our associates.” 

“I congratulate Steve on his well-deserved promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen,” said Richard C. Gozon, Chairman of the Board of AmerisourceBergen. “Steve’s demonstrated leadership, his deep knowledge of the industry, and his commitment to excellence have given the Board every confidence that the Company will continue to deliver the outstanding performance that AmerisourceBergen stakeholders have come to expect.” 

Collis previously served as President and Chief Operating Officer, responsible for all AmerisourceBergen business units including AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (ABPG). Before being promoted to that position in November 2010, Collis was Executive Vice President of AmerisourceBergen and President of ABDC, the Company’s largest subsidiary with revenues over $60 billion. Over his 17 year tenure with the Company, Collis was the driving force behind growing and developing ABSG into the market-leader it is today, with $16 billion in annualized revenues. 

The Company’s Board of Directors currently consists of nine members, including Collis, who was elected to serve on the Board in May 2011.

Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2010 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
