Occupation
Businessman


Romero Rodrigues Filho (São Paulo, October 1, 1977) is a Brazilian businessman who studied Electric Engineering at the Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo. He was a founder and president of BuscaPé (www.buscape.com), a Group that also includes the companies Bondfaro, Confiômetro, CortaContas, e-Behavior, e-bit, Lomadee, Pagamento Digital, FControl, Pista Certa, QueBarato! and SaveMe. At the age of 21, Romero created BuscaPé with three partners also from the University: Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier.
In 2009, BuscaPé was sold to the South African company Naspers for US$ 342 million.[1]
Career[edit]
Rodrigues entered the Escola Politécnica of the Universidade de São Paulo in 1995, when he was 18 years old. After his primary and secondary studies at the Colégio Visconde de Porto Seguro, in Morumbi, São Paulo, he entered the Electric Engineering course. Between 1996 and 2000, Romero worked as a researcher, as part of professional practice at the “Laboratório de Arquitetura e Redes de Computadores” (LARC) of the Poli USP, taking part in projects such as the development of Internet 2 in Brazil (RMAV), Data Base, Security and Monitoring of links. In 1998, Romero and three friends from the University, Ronaldo Takahashi, Rodrigo Borges and Mário Letelier, founded BuscaPé.
Leadership of BuscaPé[edit]
The first idea of what became BuscaPé surged when Rodrigo Borges was looking for a printer model on the Internet. He could not find information on the price or technical specifications of the product online. Therefore, the four friends concluded that it was an opportunity to be explored and decided to create a business that could provide a solution for that need. With investments of R$ 100 from each monthly to pay for hosting, system development and layout, the four founded BuscaPé in the “garage company” style in 1998. Romero assumed leadership of the project from the beginning, acting as president of BuscaPé. The businessman also led the process of internationalization and expansion of BuscaPé, and its sale of the company to Naspers in 2009.

Here you will find my résumé and two Spanish articles; one from a business Colombian newspaper, and another from a Chilean business magazine, both of them wrote articles about one business which I was working before I came to the US and which I would like to explain to you in more detail.
resume
I have over that fourteen years of experience in financial markets and right now I would like to launch a hedge fund specialized in Latin-American markets. Here you will find my resume
Colombian Soccer Teams IPO’s
The business idea is to try to do IPO’s with the most important Colombian soccer teams. In Colombia, the soccer teams were created as a nonprofit organization, during some time this business model worked. However, nowadays the majority of the soccer teams are living deep financial problems. Therefore, the idea is to resolve that problem using two ways: First, we will transform the teams into for-profit organizations. Second, we will raise money to financing the new business model which will be more related with the English Premier League management ideas, which means to see the teams as an entertainment companies.
One of our principal aims, as an Investment Banking company is trying to increase the number of company which want to issue their stocks in the public market. We strongly believe that this is one of the most important ways to help the entrepreneurs and  Colombian economy in general. For that reason, we claim that with this project  we might  convince  other companies to use the stock market as a place to find funding
Articles
This is an article from a Chilean magazine which wrote their perspective about this business opportunity
http://archivo.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2008/diciembre/15/noticias/economia/
In this article you will find a brief explanation about what the project is and what we think it might help the soccer industry in Colombia
