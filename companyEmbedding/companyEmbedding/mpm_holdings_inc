The Company operates through two segments: Silicones and Quartz. The Company is a producer of silicones, silicone derivatives and organofunctional silanes, and is engaged in the development and manufacture of products derived from quartz and specialty ceramics. Momentive's subsidiary, MPM Intermediate Holdings Inc. (Intermediate Holdings), is a holding company for its subsidiary, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. (MPM) and its subsidiaries. Its products are used in various applications and are sold into various markets, such as industrial, building and construction, transportation, agriculture, electronics, healthcare, personal care, semiconductor and fiber optics.SiliconesThe Company manufactures a range of elastomers, engineered materials and fluids. Silicones are used in product formulations primarily due to two factors: their high degree of inertness (resistance to heat, electricity and chemical reactions) and the ability during manufacturing to modify their viscosity, enabling production of end-products with variation in levels of lubricity or adhesion. Its silicones product portfolio consists primarily of Fluids; Silanes and Resins; Intermediates; Elastomers; Specialty Coatings; Room Temperature Vulcanizers; Urethane Additives, and Consumer and Construction Sealants. Fluids products are polydimethylsiloxane polymers, co-polymers, elastomers and gel networks, antifoams and emulsions. Fluids are used primarily in the personal care, home care and auto care, textiles, oil and gas, agriculture and industrial end-markets, and are sold under the Magnasoft, Sagtex, Formasil, Silwet, Silsoft, Silshine, Tospearl and Velvesil brands.Silane and resin products are primarily used as components in a range of specialty applications. The Company sells silane and specialty resins brands, including Silblock, A-Link, Wetlink, Silquest, NXT, Pearlene, SPUR, Tospearl and CoatOSil. Intermediate products are a set of siloxane, silane, and by-product materials produced in chemical operation and primarily used as inputs for other product portfolios. Silicone elastomers are blends of silicone polymers and various fillers, and include solid and liquid elastomers. Elastomers products are used primarily in the healthcare, consumer products, energy and automotive end-markets, and are sold under the Tufel, Ultra Tufel, Silplus, LSR/LIM, Silopren, and Addisil brand names. Specialty Coatings products are formulated solutions. Specialty Coatings brands include SilForce, Silgrip, Silblock, Baysilone, and Anchorsil. Room Temperature Vulcanization (RTV) products consist of highly engineered gels, adhesives, encapsulants and sealants. RTV products include the TSE, SilCool, InvisiSil and SnapSil brand names.Urethane Additive's product portfolio includes silicone surfactants used for stabilizing polyurethane foam and a line of tertiary amines to provide blow, gel and balanced catalysis in polyurethane foam reaction. Urethane additive products are sold under the Niax and Geolite brands. Consumer sealants are used by homeowners, builders and contractors for a range of projects throughout the home, including reducing damaging effects of moisture and protecting the home from pollen, pollution and pests. Its consumer and construction sealant products are also sold under various private labels for various hardware and paint retailers.QuartzThe Company's Quartz business includes the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and ceramic materials. Fused quartz, a glass manufactured principally from quartz sand, is used in processes requiring extreme temperature, high purity and other specific characteristics. Fused quartz and ceramic materials are used in a range of industries, including semiconductor, lamp tubing, manufacturing, packaging, cosmetics and fiber optics. Its Quartz business' products are used as substitutes for glass.
