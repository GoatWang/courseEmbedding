What are analysts saying about Prudential Financial stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Prudential Financial stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Prudential Financial remains well poised for growth on the back of its high performing asset management business, widespread international operations and deeper reach in the pension risk transfer market. It strives to build its leadership position in the pension risk transfer market, having great potential. Expanded international presence provides it with better organic growth opportunities than peers. Also, a strong balance sheet and efficient capital management are tailwinds. It now expects ROE between 12% and 13% in the near to intermediate-term. However, exposure to low interest rates, unfavorable currency impact and regulatory control remain headwinds. Also, shares of Prudential Financial underperformed the Zacks categorized Multi line insurance industry, year to date. With respect to quarterly results, Prudential Financial’s first-quarter 2017 earnings beat our expectations and also improved year over year." (6/14/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.46)Consensus Price Target: $111.18 (1.78% downside)
