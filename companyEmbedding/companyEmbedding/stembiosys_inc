StemBioSys Inc. has cleared a major hurdle on its path to commercialization in North America. The San Antonio-based biotech company, which has struck product distribution deals in Asia and Europe, has now gained crucial product support here in North America.
StemBioSys President and CEO Bob Hutchens said the Alamo City company has reached an agreement with VWR Corp. to exclusively market and distribute stem cell products in the U.S. and in Canada.

VWR (NASDAQ:VWR), which has its headquarters in Radnor, Pennsylvania, is a global player in the life sciences industry. Hutchens said the company will play a crucial role in StemBioSys' international expansion.




“This is a huge deal for us,” Hutchens told me. “Early last year, we identified the need to significantly increase our sales efforts in the U.S. and Canada. We also recognized that our limited scope and resources meant that we could not do this alone. We needed to find a partner to help us grow.”
StemBioSys initially entered into discussions with VWR in March 2016. Hutchens said those talks led to an agreement that will give the San Antonio company hundreds more sales personnel and other important marketing resources.
“The coverage with researchers in the U.S. and Canada we'll get is something we simply could not build on our own,” Hutchens said.
He added that the deal also provides StemBioSys and its products with a “seal of approval” of sorts because of VWR’s international track record. That endorsement is expected to provide an additional boost to StemBioSys’ international commercialization efforts.




 


Currently, StemBioSys has similar deals with three other companies — Funakoshi, Nextcell and Seoulin Bioscience. Those agreements have allowed the San Antonio company to penetrate major markets in Japan, Europe and South Korea, respectively.
There is no additional distribution deal pending at this point. However, Hutchens said some of StemBioSys’ existing agreements could be expanded to cover more products and geography.

ABOUT BM-HPME®
BM-HPME is an advanced stem cell culture system that replicates the 3-dimensional “home” in which stem cells naturally reside and proliferate. Our unique technology enables users to isolate and grow stem cells, and other difficult to culture cells, from a variety of sources including but not limited to adipose, bone marrow and
umbilical cord blood/tissue.  MORE

Why BM-HPME®
BM-HPME offers a number of advantageous benefits.  Multiple studies have shown that BM-HPME enhances isolation and provides a higher quantity of usable stem cells, with a higher quality and motility, when compared to cells grown on tissue culture-treated plastic.  MORE

StemBioSys Inc. has closed on $8 million in Series A preferred stock financing that the company will use to help launch its initial product — the HPME (High Performance Microenvironment) advanced stem cell culture system.
StemBioSys CEO Bob Hutchens said the company will invest proceeds from the Series A funding in the development of a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) manufacturing facility and on market preparations for its product launch later this year.

Hutchens has told me the San Antonio-based biomedical company is actively pursuing therapeutic applications for its core technologies and is currently collaborating with more than a dozen strategic partners.




“In addition, we have initiated multiple collaborative, sponsored research agreements with leading academic institutions to further validate the utility of the HPME technology,” Hutchens said. The list of institutions includes StemBioSys is working with includes the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the University of Texas at San Antonio and Langer/Anderson Laboratories at MIT.
StemBioSys was founded in 2010. The company’s chairwoman, Cathy Burzik, said StemBioSys has come a long way in a relatively short period. She said the new funding provides StemBioSys with the “significant capital needed to push through this next phase of corporate development.”
San Antonio-based Targeted Technology Fund led the financing with an investment of $2.25 million. More than 50 angel investors also participated in the funding round.
Hutchens said StemBioSys plans to launch a Series B funding round in late 2015 or early 2016 to help complete the commercial launch of its initial research product and continue to explore therapeutic applications for its proprietary novel technologies.

ABOUT BM-HPME®
BM-HPME is an advanced stem cell culture system that replicates the 3-dimensional “home” in which stem cells naturally reside and proliferate. Our unique technology enables users to isolate and grow stem cells, and other difficult to culture cells, from a variety of sources including but not limited to adipose, bone marrow and
umbilical cord blood/tissue.  MORE

Why BM-HPME®
BM-HPME offers a number of advantageous benefits.  Multiple studies have shown that BM-HPME enhances isolation and provides a higher quantity of usable stem cells, with a higher quality and motility, when compared to cells grown on tissue culture-treated plastic.  MORE

 StemBioSys, Inc. based in San Antonio, Texas, is a privately-held biomedical company focused on enhancing the growth and delivery of adult stem cells for research, therapeutic or drug discovery applications.  Its patented and proprietary technology platforms – licensed from the UT Systems– overcome key obstacles to creating clinically useful stem cell therapies.  The centerpiece of these enabling technologies is the HPME® (High Performance Micro Environment) platform.  This cell derived 3-dimensional microenvironment allows a variety of stem cells to replicate more rapidly, maintain a small cell size and express markers indicative of retained stem cell potency beyond that seen with traditional tissue culture substrates.  This year, StemBioSys will announce a new advanced version of its cell expansion technology and specialized cell lines enabled by this technology. Our products are available for the research market in the United States through VWR.  
StemBioSys, Inc. is actively seeking collaborations with partners looking for cell expansion technologies.

Benefits of BM-HPME® - StemBioSys















































StemBioSys


			Benefits of BM-HPME® 


BM-HPME® OFFERS A NUMBER OF PUBLISHED BENEFITS. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BM-HPME® CULTURE RESULTS IN GREATER QUANTITY OF USABLE STEM CELLS, WITH A BETTER ATTACHMENT AND A HIGHER QUALITY AND MOTILITY, WHEN COMPARED TO CELLS GROWN ON TISSUE CULTURE-TREATED PLASTIC.
HPME® is Unique. HPME® is the only stem cell substrate to closely mimic the full biochemical and structural microenvironment that stem cells normally see in their native environment.
BM-HPME® is ready-to-use. The matrix is already attached to the culture vessel. No reconstitution of powders or fluids and coating of dishes is required.
Higher quality and quantity of cells. Multiple HPME® published studies have demonstrated enhanced proliferation and increased expression of key stem cell characteristics when compared to cells grown on standard tissue culture plastic.

StemBioSys


			Technology Platform			


Our proprietary novel technology platform is an advanced stem cell culture system – HPME® – High Performance Micro Environment. It replicates the 3-dimensional “home” in which stem cells naturally reside and proliferate. Our unique technology enables users to isolate and grow stem cells from a variety of sources including but not limited to adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord blood/tissue.
OUR CORE NOVEL TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS AN ADVANCED STEM CELL CULTURE SYSTEM – HPME® – HIGH PERFORMANCE MICRO ENVIRONMENT. BM-HPME® REPLICATES THE 3-DIMENSIONAL “HOME” IN WHICH STEM CELLS NATURALLY RESIDE AND PROLIFERATE. 
Stem cells grown in BM-HPME® remain small, proliferative and undifferentiated. Our unique technology enables users to isolate and grow stem cells and other difficult to culture cells from a variety of sources including but not limited to adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord blood/tissue and cancer cells.
The HPME® architecture also has enabled us to isolate and expand multi-potent stem cells from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB-SCs), a non-controversial and plentiful resource. This patent-pending process produces non-differentiated stem cells capable of producing tissues from all 3 developmental germ layers.
In pursuing proof-of-concept, we have documented how our hUCB-SCs, when implanted into experimental animals, produce discrete bundles of various human tissues, including muscle, nerve, bone, adipose and glandular tissues. StemBioSys will explore the clinical effects of the trophic hormones, mediators and growth factors produced by and associated with these stem cells.
