I have used Travelers insurance for my entire adult life and I love the service they have provided for me throughout. I have been involved in two accidents both not my fault and they went to bat for me in both. I felt very protected throughout the ordeal and I can't begin to describe the emotional toll a serious accident can have, they were very helpful and kind. I enjoy working with them and I will be a customer of theirs for life.… read more

Farmers has been our carrier for over a decade. We have had two major instances when our home incurred flood damage (once from a storm, and the other from an AC leak). On both occasions, the adjustor was at our home the next day, and the clean-up crew arrived the next day (on the second occasion, he was there that evening.) Farmers remained in touch throughout our ordeal to make sure everything had been take care of accordingly. I have definitely recommended Farmers to friends an family, and people are always appreciative when I do!… read more

Kentucky Farm Bureau has been my homeowner insurance provider since I bought my home in 2008. We never had any claims until June of 2014 after our house exploded due to a gas explosion. We lost everything we owned but at least walked away with our lives. That very same day, our insurance agent came by and was very reassuring that she would help us in any way she could. So, the next day we went to the insurance office and met with the adjuster. She was fairly nice but not very experienced. Ours was her first fire/explosion claim. Because of her lack of experience, I think that slowed the whole process down. Not to mention the ladies in the office and the agent were no help whatsoever with any questions we had. It was all up to the adjuster who was only available once a week and very hard to reach on the phone. It was a frustrating experience but in the end, everything worked out. I still use Kentucky Farm Bureau as my insurance provider.… read more

I have good and bad experiences with my car insurance company which is Nationwide Auto Insurance. A good experience I have had with them is one day at a local gas station I accidentally backed into a parked car. It was a pretty good dent so I gave the other party my insurance info. They contacted me right away and told me that they will take care of everything. All they asked of me was to record a statement explaining what happened and they contacted me that same week with the results. Even though I was found as the one at fault they did not give me any stress they immediately took care of the accident and notified me about how much coverage I still had with the company.… read more

I signed up for Cooke home insurance.and was ultimately very disappointed with my experience. The agent came out to my home to look at the property and meanwhile I filled out all the appropriate paperwork and received my login information online. I even received my first bill to pay. The price was right and everything appeared to be efficient. I assumed that I was in business and my home was now insured against damage. About one month later, I received a note telling me that my insurance was canceled because my home was not suitable to be insured with them. This was a very disappointing experience because they gave deceiving messages and even billed me. I would not recommend Cooke insurance at this time.… read more

When I was shopping around for car insurance so I could get away from one of the big box insurers I came across Nationwide. Not only are they ads quite catchy but their service is incredibly exceptional whether it's their prices or the quality of customer service. I ended up inquiring about a quote for my customized car insurance policy online and found that their prices were much better than the big chain insurers while offering me better protection. I confirmed my car insurance policy purchase over the phone with one of the most friendly and helpful customer service agents I have ever dealt with. I would definitely suggest anyone looking for car insurance to check into Nationwide.… read more

I've used several of the big providers, but my experience with Nationwide has been by far the best. In this day and age where everything is so automated and competitive; their attention to detail and customer service responsiveness is by far the best. The representative tailored everything without pushing an agenda. The Accident Forgiveness program is what drew me to check them out in the first place. This along with the Vanishing Deductible are features I can truly use to my advantage. I would highly recommend using Nationwide for any of your insurance needs.… read more

When I was looking for vehicle insurance, Nationwide was one of the companies I researched. Their website let me customize an auto insurance policy that would fit me and the pocketbook. I liked the Vanishing Deductible and Accident Forgiveness they offered and the rate I was quoted (online) was going to fit right in. I am very thorough when it comes to what I spend my money on, so I did check into a couple more. Being a senior citizen has added a few perks (discounts) that I have a tendency to forget about, but when asking Nationwide if they offered any, I was told no. So I was able to find another insurance company that gave me what I needed, for a better price and only raised monthly payment by $5 when I added 2nd vehicle. Nationwide is a good company, but they ended up being a little pricey for me.… read more

I have been a business customer of Progressive for about 5 years now. When our broker found this policy for us, I was initially a little nervous about accepting it- I had a homeowners policy with Progressive at one time and did not have a very good experience. However, I have been incredibly satisfied with my experience this time around. Progressive's website makes it easy to review your policy, make payments and/or claims, and even print new or additional insurance cards. Their customer service operators are always knowledgeable and friendly, and someone is available to answer my questions 24-7. Their rates are lower than any others we have checked with, and there has never been an issue as we have had to frequently change drivers and vehicles listed on our policy.… read more

I have been a customer of New York Central Mutual for my homeowners insurance ever since we closed on our house in late 2009. To date I have been extremely pleased with the policy. To start the rates seem very affordable for the level of coverage we are getting and there have never been any surprise policy increases. Additionally, I was able to add more liability coverage without any headaches and without seeing a drastic rate increase.… read more

I have been using USAA for my auto insurance for almost 15 years. Although I routinely shop around I have yet to find better rates for me and my wife. I commute over 80 miles daily in the Washington, DC area. We do have long and clean driving records so I know that helps our rates tremendously. USAA's online tolls are easy to use and allow you to tweak your policy to meet your needs and budget. You can enter a proposed change in coverage and it will give you the new rate right away. I used this to increase my deductible and increase my liability coverage just a couple of years ago and it allowed me to hone in on an amount of coverage with a payment I could live with. At first I paid every six months to take advantage of a discount but eventually the allowed monthly payments for the same premium. The automatically debit my bank account for the premium each month so there is never a missed payment and resulting late fee or lapse in coverage. It has been a decade or so since my last claim, but they responded quickly and fairly with settlement. If you are a veteran or family member of one I highly recommend you check out USAA for all your insurance needs.… read more

I have had great experiences with my Nationwide Policy. They are very knowledgeable and kind I can always call and expect the best customer service. Adding vehicles is so easy and they never make me pay upfront, it is added to next bill (monthly installments). I had to have my windshield repaired and it was free and the company they use drove to my place of work and fixed it on the spot all without charge. Premiums are very reasonable and you can rest assure that you have great coverage. Its the best company and coverage that I have ever had. I dont currently use them now because of relocation and expenses but when I had them I loved it. I will one day use them again as soon as possible.… read more

I have AAA auto insurance, and I find it to be excellent. I have long been a loyal AAA member, enjoying the benefits of roadside assistance and various retail discounts, that I thought it made sense to scope them out as an insurance provider. I like that they gave me a competitive rate and took the time to describe the details of exactly what I would be getting on my policy. I have a few minor accidents here and there, and my rates have stayed low, and the coverage they’ve provided has been great.… read more

I have had State Farm since I started driving many, many years ago! Perhaps they are a bit more expensive than many of the cut-rate insurers, but I find it comforting to know that my agent will personally take my calls 24/7 (and fortunately, have never had to do it, but he has assured me time and time again that it's ok to do so). In addition, when I did have an accident a while back, I wasn't keen on purchasing a new vehicle and having car payments; State Farm got my car repaired and I continue to drive that same car almost 75,000 miles later!… read more

We used Traveler when we had our business for liability insurance. The rates were very reasonable and competitive. Customer service was available when needed, which was often, as we had to produce certificates of insurance in very short time spans when we were doing some projects. Was very satisfied with their service. We were easily able to get the certificates as need with various certificate holders named, which was very important for us to be able to continue doing business. Never had to file a claim with them, but they were always professional and courteous when in all of our dealings with them.… read more

I currently use Arcadia for my car insurance. Billing started out around 107 a month which was perfect for me, and then after a few months they lowered my payments to 95. I was pleased with this action and haven't had any problems so far with my plan. I highly recommend Arcadia for those with newer vehicles since they give you discounts based on the vehicle you buy and more. I've had other insurance companies in the past try to scam me over and raise my monthly payments after a week, but I've had Arcadia for 6 months now and have loved every minute of it.… read more

My homeowner's insurance is with Tower Hill Insurance. I was assigned this company after Allstate dropped my policy - I live in Florida and Allstate chose to no longer insure due to hurricane risk. Despite this, I have had no problems with this company. I have put in one claim when my air conditioner was damaged due to a power surge. After this claim, everything was handled professionally, and I received excellent, quick customer service. I definitely would recommend them to anyone who is looking for insurance for their home. I will definitely continue to renew my homeowner's policy with Tower Hill Insurance.8… read more

I've had Farmer's insurance for many years now. Though I haven't had many incidents where I've needed them thankfully, there were always available when I did! When my car was backed over (Not into but over!) by a truck up to the middle of the hood, they got me in a stunning rental car right away. I first had Farmers through being on my mothers policy, but I chose to continue with them on my own because it was so simple to branch off! I highly recommend Farmer's for their personal care of your insurance needs.… read more

I was using Direct General auto insurance but since then I have switched. I noticed that I could get insurance cheaper at a different insurance company. I was satisfied with the services that I received from Direct General but, saving a few dollars was more important when shopping for coverage. Direct General has been very convenient and has always provided me with good customer service. Once one of my vehicles were stolen and Direct General got involved very quickly. Everything was taken care of immediately and all ended well. If it was not time for a renewal I would probably still be with Direct General.… read more

I use Liberty Mutual as my home insurance provider, and I have been very happy with them. A few friends of mine work for the company, and I originally signed up because they offered me a deal I couldn’t refuse. They were the first ones to help me through the process, and then they passed me along to helpful customer service representatives who very thoroughly went over any questions that I had. This was especially helpful because insurance policies can be difficult to understand navigate. Premiums and deductibles are also fairly low on my plan even though I have substantial coverage.… read more

I've done business with Farmer's Insurance in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma for many years, specifically with Dick Baze and later Jason Childs after Dick retired. Overall, I had a good experience with both of them, and I'd recommend doing business with them if you're in the area. I found them easy to work with, and it was nice to have the option to electronically print off the forms rather than waiting for the mail, though I'm sure that most if not all insurance companies have that option at this point.… read more

I used to be a member of Farmers Insurance. I was a member for over 7 years with no accidents or claims. I had 2 cars with full coverage on both of them. Not just liability,but FULL coverage. My wife was in an accident at no fault of her own. This happened on the weekend,we had the car towed to a dealer (the car was only 2 years old and we always had the dealer do the maintenance) so they could fix the damage. We both work so having a car for both of us was essential. I got a rental car for my wife,the dealer said it would be about 1 week to fix the problem. On Monday I contacted my agent,whom I will not disclose,and he said that "FARMERS doesn't allow the dealer to fix the damage because it is too expensive AND that they would have to approve the rental charges" Not,are you okay? but straight to the expenses that they would have to put out. I advised that the dealership already has the car and we have a rental car. He said that they would not pay for all the charges but would try to get us a discount. I was so upset that I hung up the phone and called another insurance company right then. Of course they couldn't help me with this claim...but I did switch over all my accounts to them (my cars and home). I eventually did get my wife's car situation all taken care of with Farmers,but it was such a hassle that I will never recommend this company to anyone.… read more

We recently switched our home and auto insurance to Progressive. We were hesitant leaving a local company with agents we knew, but after seeing how much we could actually save with Progressive, keeping the same coverage, it was a no-brainer for us to switch. We have been happy with the simplicity in them taking over our escrow account at our mortgage bank, and the amount of communication we have received has been perfect.

I have never had an issue with American Family Insurance. A while back I had an issue with the law and my initial insurance dropped me. American Family was able to renew my insurance and gave me incentives to never have such an issue again. Since then, my insurance has been delightfully unnoticeable. If you set up a recurring payment, they will remind you of the amount due before removing it from your account and that is perfectly enough for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of getting insurance.… read more

I had Esurance for over a year. I needed full coverage and it was difficult to find an affordable premium. Esurance provided an affordable premium in return for a commitment of monthly automatic payments. It was a good trade-off. Customer service was also pleasant and helpful. I also felt comfort with knowing that I had first time accident forgiveness. Unfotunately, Esurance raised my rate when my premium was updated. I decided to cancel my policy. I now carry Safe-Auto which is not the most desirable insurance but it is the most affordable for my full-coverage needs. I plan on staying with them as long as they keep my rate consistent. It is difficult to find that in today's market.… read more

In January of this year (2015) I desperately needed car insurance and I didn't have much money, I never do, so after spending a couple of days looking around I went with Safe-Auto. They give minimal legal coverage at a decent price, my payments came out to $50 a month...at first. After the first $50 payment I received a letter in the mail from Safe-Auto telling me that my rate was going up to $107 for no reason that I could decipher. If it weren't for that I'd still be with them, as everything else about the company is decent, though my experience was short.… read more

American Family Insurance is a smaller company, but they are very good for car, business, home and life insurance. They have great prices that are easy to fit into your budget.

If you're looking for an affordable insurance company that doesn't treat their customers like a number, then I would highly recommend American Family.… read more

When dealing with their customer service team, it was difficult to get a straight answer, and I always felt that they were trying to find ways to make us pay more money.

Over the years I have been insured by State Farm and Allstate. I never had a claim nor any form of traffic violation yet my bill continued to go up and up. A friend of mine suggested I check into GEICO and I have never been happier. The service is outstanding, the online reps do a fantastic job taking care of any policy holder needs and absolutely no one can match their rates. I constantly get notices from other carriers advertising savings of hundreds of dollars annually. I looked into a couple a few months back and discovered my GEICO rates at almost 50% less then their competition. I will be with GEICO until I leave this planet!… read more

We had what is called a hundred year flood. The entire southern end of Illinois was flooded. Our town was even locked in by water. We couldn't get out. The National Guard had to bring in supplies and help us. It was so bad it was declared a national disaster area by the government.

I've had Farmers Insurance for an incredibly long time and it's been grouped with several other vehicles that my family owns. The local office is cute and our main staffer is incredibly friendly and helpful with everything. We had a rock hit one of our front windshields on the highway earlier this year and it took a small chip of the glass and as well leaving a few very small cracks. They actually offered a service to have someone come out and seal the cracks and small chip instead of raising rates for an incident. Saved us money on replacement and on insurance!… read more

The original reason I chose Liberty Mutual was because they gave me the lowest rate.  After my first year with them and a couple of car lock outs and one fender bender, my rate was still lower with them than any other company.  The customer service is extraordinary and they work with you in any way they can!

I recently bought a new car and decided to get a new insurance company. I went with Commerce insurance as their online website quoted me the best price. It also told me I needed to see a broker to put through my application. When I went to the broker they quoted me a price which was 300 dollars more than the online application. I still went with them as they were still cheaper than some of the others, and I wanted to go pick up my new car. The following week they sent me a letter saying once they entered my vin number in my policy went up ANOTHER 350. I was not pleased but in a bad position as I had already picked up my car and given Commerce my down payment, and didn't have another 400 for a down payment at a different insurance company. I will be changing once this policy is up though.… read more

We decided to try something new and use esurance for our car insurance. Not a wise choice on our part. The rates were not really cheaper and when my daughter had an accident getting them to act was tough. Now really too happy with the service. It wasn't bad but it isn't as good as advertised!

I have been with Farmers Insurance Exchange for more than twenty years and have had four cars and two houses insured through them at one time. Love the discounts they give us and whenever we have compared with other companies and have been offered a lower price all we do is call our agent and he matches their price. Wouldn't change this company for anything.

We have Westfield Insurance for both our home and our cars and have been nothing but happy with them. We have had coverage with them for about 3 years with no claims and our premiums have remained the same. The main reason that I switched to them is our previous provided would raise our rates by 10-12% each year. Everyone that we have been in contact with at the company has been excellent to deal with and we would highly recommend them to anyone looking for Insurance.… read more

The insurance company I would highly recommend is Liberty Mutual. They have excellent customer service and are always easy to get a hold of. I also like the fact they have a mobile app that allows you to review claim/coverage details. I called recently and mentioned I was going to look around for a lower rate, and the representative I spoke with asked if I had done defensive driving, which I have, and my bill was reduced immediately because of this! I am very happy to be a Liberty Mutual customer and look forward to many more years of business together.… read more

I have used Humana for several years. Have had issues on occasion, but all in all this is a good upstanding company. Humana seems to care about people, giving them consideraton above business and money. Some may disagree, but this has been my experience. I will continue to use Humana Insurance for my insurance needs inthe future. Humana is always willing to help in any cirumstance I have had need to contact them. Humana has integrity! Humana pays claims in a timely manner and if tje claim is rejected, the company doe it's best to give an explanation and will listen to my pounts amd often will change their decision. That is a good thing!… read more

I recently had my insurance policy canceled with another company, which caused a whole bunch of issues for me. The biggest issue was that my license had become suspended. I fixed all my fines, and got my license back. When searching for a new car insurance company I tried many different companies, but no one really wanted to help me because of the recent suspension, or the prices were sky high. I came across The General site for car insurance. Not only were their rates reasonable, they would also accept me as a new customer. I am very thankful for their service. Practically everything can be done online. Their site is very easy to navigate.… read more

I use CSAAA. After my father's death, we tried to use their Automotive Club customer service to avoid having to go into DMV. The receptionist may have been smacking gum and looking bored for all the interest she gave myself and my mother. When we approached, having finally got her attention, she said she couldn't help us. We'd have to go into the DMV. We told her what the customer service rep from DMV told us and she still denied having any ability to help us. It was a horrible experience. I was sorry I'd been a longtime member and this year stopped renewing my membership and using them at all. Switched entirely to State Farm.… read more

When I switched from USAA home Insurance to Amica Insurance I was pleasantly surprised! Their customer service was outstanding, their rates were comparable to USAA's which isn't easy to find cheaper. They offered great discounts on my monthly premium. I am very satisfied and have had no problems whatsoever. I would highly recommend Amica!

Unfortunately, automotive insurance is required by law in the state of Ohio and throughout the United States. Safe Auto has provided me with the coverage I've needed for the past few months and I couldn't be happier. I have a very high mileage car and my alternator had went out leaving me stuck for about an hour before the vehicle and myself were towed to a shop. Safe Auto took care of my roadside assistance/towing fee and I was back on the road the next afternoon after the car had been repaired. I couldn't be happier with an insurance company and I feel like my monthly premium is very fair for the coverage I have chosen. I'd recommend Safe Auto to those tight on money who want a quality insurance company!… read more

Insurance is a necessary evil. I have had Amica insurance for many years. I have spoken to their customer service over the years and they were always very nice to me, but I always wondered how they would be when I had an actual claim to report. Well, unfortunately I found out the hard way. I lived in a large city and drive the interstate every day. During rush hour the traffic goes very slowly, and someone hit the side of my car. I was so surprised and upset, because I thought everyone would have seen the bad traffic and slow down. Within two weeks my car was fixed and I was given a complimentary rental for my trouble. I’m sticking with Amica… read more

I was on my way to work and I was sitting at a right light and this guy ran into my car from behind. I was so upset. Thankfully when I called Amica they set my mind at ease. They got me a rental car and took care of everything. Before I knew it. My car was fixed.… read more

Farmers Insurance offered me a deal that I could not refuse when shopping for a new car. I was also searching for an auto loan provider, in which Farmers did as well. The promise was an excellent discount on both my auto and renter’s insurance if I used them as a loan provider as well. I signed up and not only got a great interest rate on the auto loan (half the rate the dealership offered), but I had a great discount on both auto and renter’s insurance as well. The process was simple and hassle-free, and I had to do very little legwork to document my renter’s insurance policy. Highly recommend Farmer's Insurance.… read more

I have been using The General for a while now and I am always pleased with their work, they never let me down and they make sure that if something happens to me or my car that they have my back! i have never been let down by this company and they have always upheld their service and their promise to provide satisfactory. One time when I was living in Hawaii, My oldest son had taken my car to the beach but he really wasn't that good at parking and he ended up grinding the side of my car with someone else. It was very horrific and there was much damage done to both cars, but The General fixed the problem. I was extremely relived about the situation because they also paid for my cars repair fee.… read more

When I financed my new car, it seemed like Nationwide was the cheapest provider that gave me the most coverage. For 3 years, they automatically drafted the payment out of my check account. Recently, I checked my account statements (it's a bad habit of mine to not keep up with my statements), and found that they raised my insurance by over $50 a month for no reason! They didn't even give me a fair warning that they were increasing it. When I contacted customer service, they were less than helpful. I told them to cancel my policy right then an there. I instantly did a search and found that State Farm was a much better fit for me. Not only was my payment the same as Nationwide (before the increase), but the agent told me they would never increase my payment, only lower it! The best quality about insurance companies should be honesty and to be honest, Nationwide does not have that quality!… read more

I used AAA for a long time because they protected me and stood by me whenever something went wrong. I was wrongly named as the one who caused an accident and they represented me and helped me to win my case. The service was amazing and the agents were personable. The insurance company took care of my every need when I was in a hit and run. They brought a car to pick me up because I didn't live near family or friends, and paid for the rental and repairs of my car. I have worked with Mercury Insurance in the past and they didn't do nearly the amount of caring AAA had.… read more

We switched to the Hartford through AARP. We were with progressive but they do not have a stable rate. You never knew what your rate was going to be. For us the deciding factor to go with Hartford was the rate and the term. We got a lower rate for a 12 mth term then we were getting for a six month term with the other companies. So far we are pleased with the company. We have been with them only two months and are claim free so far (and plan on staying that way) so have no experience with how they are when you do have a claim.… read more

I stared using Esurance about a year ago, and I have been more than satisfied with the company. The rates are much lower than when I used to be covered by StateFarm. It was also very easy to get my insurance established. You are able to do everything online, which is wonderful for something who has a loud toddler running around all over the place. If you choose, you may call and set your insurance up through a live consultant. Other members have Esurance as well; my brother had to make a claim through them and he said the process was very simple and he had no issues with the company.… read more

My family and I have been using Nationwide for the last 10 years. I had a small accident when I was 16 and using my first car which my parents had bought me. I wasn't the one at fault and after speaking to Nationwide, they were able to very efficiently walk me through the process and it was all sorted out in a matter of weeks. My dad also gets a lot discounts and promotional offers since he is a certified safe driver. Nationwide is a company of high integrity who always stick to what they promise. I am very happy with the service I am receiving from them and I see no reason why I should switch to another company.… read more

The staff was always very polite and efficient. I especially appreciated how they explained the policy to me. They didn't have me sign up for more coverage than I actually needed.… read more

You need to check out their website it's very helpful and extremely easy to navigate to find quotes and comparison shop, I would switch back if it weren't for the family.

I had car insurance with Nevada Direct for 1 year. I ended up switching companies for several reasons. The main reason I left Nevada Direct was that they kept increasing my payments after I had got into a small accident that wasn't even my fault. The rates were pretty high in the first place, but I think that was just because of my age. Maybe they'll work better for someone else, but they most definitely weren't the right fit for me.… read more

I have recently signed up with The General Insurance Company for my automobile insurance. The sign-up process was quick and easy, and I was covered immediately. However, I do have a huge complaint that I discovered after being invoiced for my third month with the company. My monthly premium more than doubled, and when I logged in online to check out what the issue was, a family member who just recently moved into my house was automatically added to my policy without my consent. When I contacted the company about this, the explanation given was that I was mailed information about this new driver showing up at the same address, and since I DIDN'T contact them to say DON'T add to my policy, they added them for me. How is that even legal? Fortunately, they were able to revert the policy without issue, but the precedent that they would do this in the first place is very disturbing.… read more

Farmers Insurance Company was formed in 1928 by two men wanting to provide good vehicle insurance to farmers. As the times changed so did the company now writing policies for anyone for automobiles, homes, and liability insurance to name a few.. Farmers also has a commercial side providing quality insurance for businesses. At one time I had policies for my automobiles, home, umbrella liability, and commercial insurance for a pharmacy and delivery car. We had an attempted break-in at the store but the alarm sounded and the thieves left before the police got there. My Farmers Agent came out and boarded up the windows that were broken and we had new glass that met current building codes installed at no cost to me by noon. On the personal side the Farmer's Adjuster came out because of wind damage and replaced a wooden privacy fence and gate, looked at the roof and said 3 sides needed replacement and paid to replace the wire fence that was also damaged. Farmer's sent me a check for the damages even before all of the repairs were done. The check was for enough to pay for a complete new roof and the other repairs we needed done. I stuck with Farmers' because of their great service and agents. Over the course of thirty years we had several agents but all provided us with quick reliable service when we had a claim.… read more

I have been using Allstate for as long as I can remember. I had Allstate when I was under my parent's insurance and when I became old enough to get my own car insurance I stayed with Allstate because it has always been good to me. I like the discounts and rewards you can get for being a safe driver. Allstate has not made any promises to me that they have not kept and this makes me a believer in them. When having to call the company I have always got someone friendly who was able to help me in whatever I needed.

I've been with USAA for three years now, and they are always helpful whenever I contact them. I've had one claim with them in the time period and they handled the claim in under 48 hours. They have also been very helpful in giving me helpful advice for home and life insurance. I plan on getting both my life insurance and homeowners insurance through USAA.

I have Esurance car insurance and have been with them for 5 years. Once I turned 18, I wanted to get my own policy and Esurance was easily the most helpful insurance company. I felt that going with a company that wasn't as major as the State Farms and GEICOs of the industry would provide me with better customer service and cheaper costs, and I was right. When I called to inquire about insurance policies and to get a quote, the sales representatives were more than happy to help me and even provided me with rates that other competitors would offer someone with my driving record. Their rates matched and surpassed those of other companies and because of that I signed up immediately. Their service was second to none and made me more than happy to sign up.… read more

I had renters insurance with them, so it wasn't a large amount.  The representative did not bat an eye and just said "Ok".  No reason why, no trying to get me to stay.

I have been with Nationwide for almost 20 years and they are the best and most reliable home insurance company that I would ever use. Whenever I call the office and have a question, a real person is there and not an answering machine! That in itself is great. When we were experiencing a terrible storm, lightning hit a part of the house, which did not cause a fire, but knocked out all of our electronic equipment. It was a scary situation. I called right away from my cell phone and they sent a rep over on the same day and we received a check for the lost equipment and to have repairs done. The other amazing thing is that our rates did not go up, partly, I feel because we have been customers for so long.… read more

I have had Foremost for 7 years now and 4 years ago we had a robbery in our home. We were out of town and noticed what had happened when we returned home. We have never had anything like this happen to us and after contacting the police I called Foremost to file a claim. The agent helping me was very nice and helpful throughout the entire process. We unfortunately were not able to get our things back but we were able to replace them within 2 weeks. I expected this process to be a long one and painful, but it was just the opposite. I have chosen to stay with Foremost because of the kindness during a tough time and because our policy amount didn't change because we filed a claim.… read more

I believe that perhaps the important qualities that a car insurance company should have are respect for the consumer and qualified/pleasant customer service representatives. As a consumer of Nationwide, I believe that these criteria have been met well in all of my numerous experiences with them.

After a number of years, I cannot speak highly enough of Nationwide’s auto insurance customer service and policies.… read more

For more than ten years Nationwide has been my insurance company and I´m very happy with it. It is a very serious company and features an excellent customer service. I think the best asset an insurance company should bear, besides the normal insurance coverages, is the easy and fast response to claims, and Nationwide provides an excellent claim response.

I went through the process of 'auditioning' insurance companies, and Nationwide was the only company that I spoke with that held my hand through the entire process of how auto insurance works. They were not the 'cheapest' company that i spoke with, but their customer service was by far much better than any of the other companies, and for me that's an attribute i love in a company.

The most important characteristic of an auto insurance company is affordable insurance. Nationwide by far was the cheapest of all the other insurance companies. I compared my quote with all the other companies and saved at least $20 from the other companies around my area. Another thing is the quality of their customer service. This is definitely something you have to look for, and nationwide has that to prove it. They were really helpful with my car accident and helped me get through every step of it and I was able to claim the money to fix it within about a week. They gave friendly advice and their staff was just amazing.… read more

For my car's and renters insurance, I was using Farmers Insurance. I'm saying "was" because when I purchased a new 2013 Hyundai Sonata, Farmers raised my insurance instead of lowering it. I have no tickets and the Sonata had way more safety features than my previous car. When I called my rep she couldn't really give me any explanation so I told her I was going to leave. To make a long story short, I went to GEICO and I'm now saving $900 a month! I stayed with Farmers for my renters insurance because they were actually cheaper than GEICO.… read more

Protecting Solar Projects with Insurance








September 20, 2013



By
Jeanne Schwartz


VP, New Venture Commercialization






































 Solar power generation is rapidly increasing and helping thousands of Americans embrace clean energy technology. According to Solar Energy Industries Association, “more than 4,400 megawatts of PV solar will come online throughout 2013.” The jump in solar development is driven by a dramatic drop in solar panel prices since 2011 along with state and federal incentive programs driving increased tax equity investments. Despite the industry’s explosive growth in recent years, economic uncertainty and risks in developing, building, operating, owning and investing in solar projects remain daunting. If concerns remain unabated, they could have a chilling effect and prevent investors and bankers from financing more projects. Already fewer than 5 percent of the 6,500 banks in the U.S. finance solar project according to truSolar, an industry consortium of solar's leading companies.
Risk and uncertainty are present throughout each phase of the solar project lifecycle from construction to operation and through its lifecycle to decommissioning.
Manufacturers struggle to compete in a marketplace where prices are low and profits slim. Project developers and engineering and procurement contractors feel the weight of working with razor thin margins too. Many of these risks are present in conventional construction projects and business operations and require strong due diligence and risk mitigation. Left unchecked such market conditions threaten the quality of projects being built now as participants up and down the value chain look to cut costs that may reduce equipment quality and ongoing operations and maintenance standards.[Native Advertisement]
According to a May 28, 2013 article, “Solar Industry Anxious Over Defective Panels,” published in The New York Times: “Worldwide, testing labs, developers, financiers and insurers are reporting similar problems and say the $77 billion solar industry is facing a quality crisis just as solar panels are on the verge of widespread adoption.”
The quality crisis stems from allegations that some solar manufacturers looking to reduce costs are using cheaper, less reliable materials in order to remain competitive. The totality of those cuts may not be readily evident now but could result in lower energy generation in the future.
Quality issues may manifest themselves as years go by, reflecting ongoing degradation of solar energy output from the equipment. Those problems may reflect poor manufacturing processes, poor due diligence practices during installation or poor operations and maintenance (O&M) standards. It is important not to lose sight that seemingly simple things, like solar panel cleaning, can have a dramatic effect on energy output.  A well-maintained solar installation can perform 10 to 30 percent better than an installation not maintained. However, a good O&M program can’t eliminate every problem embedded into a project.
Methods for Mitigating Risks
In addition to ongoing O&M, solar industry participants are adopting a variety of mitigation strategies to de-risk projects and instill confidence in the solar market. Insurance and specialized protection products are important tools in this effort. These coverages transfer or reduce the financial impact of equipment breakdowns, physical damage from natural perils, theft and liability exposures associated with owning and operating a solar system.
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) warranties are one of the most relied upon methods to reduce risk in the solar industry.
Warranties provide protection against financial and operational risks resulting from defects in design, materials and workmanship. Conventional terms and conditions in a warranty outline the manufacturer’s responsibility to replace, repair or provide financial compensation for  defective equipment. Warranties also provide performance guarantees, stipulating that a product will perform as promised by the manufacturer during a set period of time. If the equipment fails to meet up to the levels promised under the performance guarantee, the manufacturer is required to repair, replace or provide financial compensation. Typical warranties on solar panels extend from 20 to 25 years. Inverter warranties usually are for 10 years. Due to the length of their duration, warranties help alleviate some, but not all, concerns about equipment quality.
Warranties commonly exclude defects caused by failing to properly maintain the product, limit liability for damages and include disclaimers for implied warranties. They also do not cover the cost of labor for repairs or shipping costs. In addition, manufacturers are the ultimate arbitrator of whether a problem with the equipment is deemed defective and covered by the warranty or not. A warranty from a foreign manufacturer also may be difficult to enforce if that company’s provisions are governed by laws and regulations of their home country. A warranty could include a jurisdiction requiring privity of contract, which voids a warranty unless the party seeking to enforce its terms purchased the product directly from the manufacturer. The biggest worry, however, is that the manufacturer will not exist to honor their warranty five or 10 years from now. It may be impossible to make a claim and have it honored once a company is dissolved.
Innovative warranty programs and insurance products are working to fill the gaps on warranty coverage and reduce the risks associated with equipment quality. These programs transfer the fiscal responsibility for the warranties from the manufacturer to the insurance company if warranty claims are valid.
Warranty management programs provide a critical backstop by honoring the terms and conditions of the guarantee even if the manufacturer goes out of business. These programs provide a one-stop solution for all major solar project components covered by a warranty such as solar panels, inverters and racking systems regardless of the manufacturer. They go beyond traditional warranty coverage to pay for costs associated with testing, de-installation, shipping and re-installation of covered equipment.
In addition, solar project revenue protection products will recover lost revenue, including solar renewable energy credits, due to system equipment defects, degradation of output, operations and maintenance service contractor malpractice and even the lack of sunshine.
These ground-breaking protection products complement more traditional insurance products such as general liability and property insurance, standard coverages for solar projects.
Liability insurance protects against claims of bodily injury or other physical injury or property damage that may occur from business operations. Typically, this coverage will often exclude losses or damages caused by poor quality workmanship. Liability coverage frequently is coupled with property insurance, which coverage provides protection for the physical property and equipment of a business against losses from theft, fire and natural perils.
Specialized policies such as contractor’s equipment, equipment breakdown, delay in start-up and business interruption insurance also are available. These provide additional coverage that can be critical throughout the construction and operation phases of a solar project, protecting developers, owners and investors alike.
Contractor insurance fills in the gaps in traditional liability insurance. It provides coverage for negligence or errors related to the engineering, design and/or installation or poor workmanship project installation that could lead to a loss in energy production. Equipment breakdown provides coverage for electrical or equipment that is used in the generation, transmission or utilization of energy resulting mechanical or electrical failure. As its name implies, delay in start-up coverage protects against the loss of anticipated earnings due to project delays caused by natural perils or equipment failure. Business interruption insurance adds another layer of important protection, replacing business income in the event that there is project disruption due to natural peril or equipment breakdown.
On the cost side, it is sometimes argued that the expense of insurance coverages and protection plans cannot be justified as they eat away at already razor thin margins. The evidence suggests, however, that such risk management strategies are critical to ensuring the long-term viability of individual projects and the industry.
Quality issues are important throughout the process of developing and running a solar project installation whether it is in regards to the design of the system, the installation process or ongoing operations and maintenance. There are risks at all phases of a project. To satisfy lender and investor requirements sound due diligence and risk management strategies which include insurance and specialized protection are essential.

Driving efficiency in employee benefits
Pooling Solutions









We have over 30 years of multinational pooling experience, and offer a range of international solutions such as pooling and captive arrangements.








                    
            Your benefits
        


We can help you find the most efficient way to insure your employees across all of the markets you operate in.


Our pooling solutions can help you to gain global intelligence on the death, disability and medical risk of your employees.


You will be supported by a dedicated account manager.


Our global network of market-leading insurance companies, the Zurich Employee Benefits Network, offers competitively priced, high quality products and services in 129 territories.


We are providing services and solutions for 130 pooling and captive customers, covering 2,000 contracts that are reinsured to form the pooling and captive programs.














            Network partners and coverage
        






The Zurich Employee Benefits Network is a global network of market-leading insurance companies offering products and services in over 110 territories. The Zurich Employee Benefits Network consists of both Zurich-owned companies and top-quality local insurers in countries where Zurich does not have a local presence.
We are constantly reviewing our network and analyzing gaps in our geographical coverage, and consider a range of factors when we are looking to expand the Zurich Employee Benefits Network. All potential new partners are expected to demonstrate:



a strong financial position
high performance standards
expertise and reputation in the corporate customer segment
compliant products and services in all lines of business appropriate to their markets.

Please click below for a listing of countries in which we have a Network Partner.



    Network partners










            Multinational pooling products and solutions
        






Pooling works by combining the financial performance of your pooled benefit plans around the world into a consolidated account that measures credits (primarily premiums paid) against debits (claims paid plus insurer administration charges, commissions and taxes). The account is then adjusted to allow for the insurer’s risk charge and any losses carried forward from a previous accounting period. If the overall result is positive the resulting amount will be rebated to your organization as an international dividend. If the account is negative, the loss is either absorbed by the Zurich Employee Benefits Network or carried forward to the next accounting period, according to the design and type of the pool.We offer two types of pool – a company-own pool and a flex pool.To qualify for a company-own pool, you need to have at least 200 lives covered by the Zurich Employee Benefits Network Partners under contracts in at least two countries with an annual risk premium volume of EUR 200,000. Once membership reaches 500 lives a wider range of risk models is available to tailor the design of the pool to more specific requirements.If you do not meet these requirements, you can still benefit from the financing efficiency of multinational pooling through our flex pool.To find out more about the benefits of pooling and the solutions we offer, please download and read our brochure.

 Business Insurance Solutions by Industry
 Energy Business Insurance
Renewable Energy







	Renewable energy businesses have unique needs.

	Renewable energy businesses work to protect the environment using or generating clean, renewable energy, or providing the equipment and service for companies that do. Whether you are a solar power start-up or a fuel cell Fortune 1000 company, our dedicated underwriting specialists can help customize insurance solutions to your business’s unique needs, from property and general liability, workers' compensation and auto, to installation, builders risk, and international travel and sales.
	 


	Recommended Coverage for Renewable Energy Businesses








                          General Liability
                      






The Hartford offers general liability for renewable energy businesses such as wind turbine manufacturers, hydroelectric dams and power plants.

Our General Liability Choice® insurance helps protect green energy businesses from bodily injury and property claims including:
 


		Personal and advertising injury, such as: libel; slander; defamation; and product disparagement including offenses that occur from your website, bulletin boards and chat rooms

		Broad named insured, including contractual liability, manufacturer’s errors and omissions, and product recall expense coverage

		Time element pollution extension endorsements

		Blanket additional insured coverage

		Primary non-contributory coverage when required by contract

		Per project/per location aggregate

		Failure to supply coverages are available for power and utilities exposures
		 











                          Commercial Auto
                      






The Hartford understands that renewable energy businesses rely on company trucks and cars to keep their green energy operations running smoothly. Whether it’s a solar energy company sending an employee out in a company truck to perform maintenance on a solar installation or a wind turbine company transporting a 116-ft turbine blade, renewable energy businesses need to know that their employees and vehicles are covered in the event of a loss.
 
Renewable energy business insurance from The Hartford helps protect commercial vehicles with:
 


Hired auto physical damage – automatically covers physical damage to any auto a renewable energy company rents, loans or leases (up to $100,000 per loss) if the business purchases physical damage and liability coverage for its autos

Employees as additional insureds – covers a green energy company’s employees for liability if they use their own autos to conduct company business

Upset and overturn extension of coverage – covers expenses related to cleanup from an upset and overturn of spilled product
		 











                          Workers' Compensation
                      





With workers' comp from The Hartford, you may be better able to manage cash flow and mitigate audit surprises by basing your premium payments on actual, not estimated, payroll – one pay period at a time. This flexibility can be critical to businesses that are experiencing staffing changes. We offer:
 


		Broad form endorsements to help protect against certain unknown and unanticipated exposures not typically covered by a standard policy1

		Our basic option is automatically included at no extra cost and includes employers’ liability stopgap for monopolistic states and voluntary compensation

		Our extended option is available for an additional charge and includes increased limits for employer’s liability, foreign voluntary compensation and United States Longshore and Harbor workers’ Compensation Act (USL&H)
		 

1 Some coverages may not be available in all states.
 









                          Commercial Umbrella
                      






In the event that a claim made against a renewable energy business exceeds its primary liability coverage limit, The Hartford’s commercial umbrella insurance can help cover the additional costs.
 
With up to $25 million in policy limits, renewable energy businesses can rest assured knowing their commercial umbrella policy from The Hartford is there to help with additional protection when they need it most.
 








	Additional Solutions for Renewable Energy Businesses








                          Marine

Our Management Liability insurance for green, renewable energy businesses offers coverage options and limits that businesses can tailor to their specific needs. Our management liability coverages include:
 


		Directors & Officers

		Employment Practices Liability

Cost-Saving Services for Renewable Energy Businesses








                          Risk Engineering

                          Loss-Sensitive Rating Options Available
                      





A Loss-Sensitive Program is a form of insurance that allows you to pay a lower upfront premium. You pay “dollar one” up to a set limit because your business will actually participate in loss payment, up to a retention that's agreed upon between you and The Hartford.
 
Through The Hartford Energy Group, we customize loss-sensitive rating plans for larger contractors’ exposures, controls, financials, and risk-reward profile. We offer large deductible, retrospectively rated, self-insured retention and guaranteed cost plans.
 
In partnership with you and your agent, we can help you to:
 


		Save money by balancing risk retention and risk transfer with premium savings – through our customized programs

		Save time by improving effectiveness and efficiency – through customized dashboards, filters and email alerts in our risk management information system, TREO | Track Risk. Explore Opportunities.SM

		Improve outcomes by coordinating claims and risk management services – through our Risk Management Solutions team

Tools for business
Zurich Risk Room









        Zurich Risk Room is a powerful global risk assessment tool that helps your risk managers, corporate board and strategic advisers to cut through the fog of country risk.
    







                    
            Your benefits
        


Zurich Risk Room creates a three-dimensional risk simulation that reflects specific strategic concerns for your company. In its virtual risk world you can see how your chosen risks interplay differently in different countries or regions around the world. This enables you to explore the scenarios that are important to your business and make better-informed strategic decisions.


Not only does Zurich Risk Room provide a global overview of risk at a given point in time, it also allows for simulations that can help your company with scenario planning. The simulations extrapolate changes in risk metrics and show how risks can cascade through complex systems and affect a variety of locations and business situations.


Zurich Risk Room tracks 113 country risks for 174 countries on a monthly basis, with historical data going back to January 2007.

Experience Zurich Risk Room
Zurich Risk Room is available free of charge to Zurich corporate customers who are looking to build a deeper relationship with us.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

            Zurich Hazard Analysis
        







The Zurich Hazard Analysis (ZHA) approach uses your in-house expertise to systematically identify and manage key hazards. We then work with you to develop tailor-made risk improvement measures to help reduce those hazards.
ZHA offers every business a practical way to identify and evaluate risks across their entire organization. However, a ZHA analysis can also be designed specifically for your industry.  By doing so, ZHA can be applied in a variety of strategic and tactical, operational situations. ZHA relies on the expertise of those most knowledgeable about the project, phase or process being analyzed: your in-house personnel. Led by a Zurich risk engineering specialist, these individuals help identify the key risks, determine the probability and severity of each, and then decide what the acceptable level of risk is for your unique business model. Based on this analysis, improvement actions are developed to help eliminate, reduce or manage anything above the risk tolerance boundary.
Our ZHA process is simple, straight-forward and requires only minimal training. It often takes less time than other hazard analysis tools, because it focuses on the risks you have identified as being outside your tolerance boundary. It is also versatile in that it can be used during any phase of a design, process or project activity.










            Zurich Risk Profiling
        







Growth opportunities can mean new risks for your organization.

With this holistic view, our specialists aim to create a strategy that can help you prioritize, manage and mitigate risks standing in the way of your company’s goals, and increase profitability and shareholder value.
Our approach to risk profiling is collaborative. We work with our customers and brokers to uncover risks in their specific business landscape, keeping their business objectives in mind.

Lanxess AG, one of the leading specialty chemical groups in Germany, took over three rubber production units in Brazil. To achieve global standards in operational practices around fire protection and process safety, they asked Zurich Risk Engineering to identify areas for improvement and for help to create an action plan.Zurich Risk Engineering also carried out operator training and risk reduction sessions. Overall safety at the sites improved significantly as a result.

With Zurich we have a very open and cooperative atmosphere and dialogue with lively and positive discussions.

Zurich Japan has had a long relationship with IKEA. Almost immediately after the tragic earthquake on March 11th, 2011, IKEA contacted Hisashi, our Risk Engineer from Zurich’s Tokyo office, asking for support in assessing our affected stores and assistance in resuming operations. Despite public transportation having not yet fully recovered from the earthquake, Hisashi used a combination of his personal bicycle as well as taxis to reach the sites, complete thorough assessments with accompanying reports, all within a few days.

His personal and professional commitment allowed IKEA to reopen for business quickly and reduce financial impact.
