Our Customers Include:

Battery OEMs

Grid-scale Energy Storage




















Safe, secure, and reliable
Battery performance can make or break a product. Issues with lifetime, performance and reliability drive dissatisfaction, while battery failures in the field can have serious and even dire consequences for end-users. This makes battery intelligence — including the ability to accurately monitor and predict battery failure — critical for developers and users alike.  
Whether it’s storing the energy New York City needs to shine brightly through a storm or ensuring that the systems our military and law enforcement rely on are ready when they're needed, boosting the latest consumer gadget ahead of the competition or paving the way for affordable electric vehicles of the future, battery intelligence is key. 
We help our customers create cost and production efficiencies throughout all stages of a battery’s development. We help you commit fewer resources and expend less capital on production; we provide the insight needed to make smart decisions in R&D, procurement and in-field monitoring; and we ensure quality, reliability and perhaps most importantly, predictability of the end product creating considerably less risk with a product that’s risky by nature.

Conveyor Belting


Terpco Inc. offers a variety of different conveyor belting services including: wire belting, light weight belting, and heavy weight belting. Our belting services are built to last and used for many different applications including: construction, mulching, food service, paper products, metal parts production, textile manufacturing, and electronic parts manufacturing



































Lightweight Conveyor Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with many different types of light-weight belting including: Teflon, PVC, Mesh, Modular, Thermalplastic, Table-Top Chain, and High Temperature Belts, plus many more. Please speak with a Terpco Representative about your options with these belts.																		
																	


























Heavy Duty Conveyor Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with Heavy-Weight belting that is built to last. Our heavy-weight belting can be used in various industries from construction to mulching. Please speak with a Terpco Representative or submit a request for information concerning our heavy-weight belting.																		
																	


























Plastic Modular Belting



																		Terpco Plastic Modular Conveyor Belts are made of plastic modules and are assembled in an interlocked, bricklay pattern with full-length hinge rods — an inherently strong design. Driven and tracked by plastic sprockets, Plastic Modular Conveyor Belts have the qualities plant operators and designers look for.																		
																	


























Pull Belts



																		Terpco is able to provide your company and product line with replacement pull belts. We cover replacement belts for all major machine line brands such as Hayssen, Woodman, Rovema, and many others. We are able to customize these belts with items you need for your application, such as vacuum holes.

Specialty Form/Fill & Seal Belting



																		Terpco can provide specialty form/fill and seal belting per specifications. Please forward details on your application and requirements for product information.																		
																	


























Timing & Drive Belting



																		Timing belts are the perfect choice for applications where traditional belt options are unable to provide performance synchronization, and exact product placement. When precise timing is required, Timing and Drive Belts are the best solution. Timing and Drive Belts can be made to your exact dimensional needs, and customized with guides, profiles and covers to ensure your product or component is always in the right place at the right time. 
																		
																	


























Wire Belting



																		Terpco Inc. is able to offer your company various types of Wire Belting. Some of the types we typically provide are Balance Weave, Flat Wire, and Oven/Baking Bands. Please speak with a Terpco Representative concerning any questions you may have on our Wire Belting.																		
																	


























Dewatering Belts



																		Terpco’s synthetic and metal dewatering meshes are individually matched to your application as conveyor belts, filter belts or screen belts. Terpco meshes have common uses in the Agricultural and Food Processing industries.. Other areas of application includewoodprocessing, flue gas desulphurization, mining and sewage treatment sectors.
																		
																	


























Pulleys And Lagging



																		Pulley lagging increases the traction between the belt and the pulley, which in turn reduces load and wear on the drive, belt, pulleys, bearings and take-up. For efficient and economical conveyor operation, proper pulley lagging is integral detail
																		
																	


























Motorized Pulleys



																		A motorized pulley is a drum motor in which the body rotates around a stationary shaft. The rotating outer “drum” becomes thetraction surface which powers the conveyor belt. Electric power leads pass through the stationary shaft to motor terminals inside the pulley housing. Since the end shaft does not rotate, there is no need for slip rings to deliver electrical power to the motor windings.

Terpco is able to services belts through cleaning/scraping systems, cleat installation, sidewall fabrication, vacuum holes, plus many more. Please speak with a Terpco Representative about any specific questions you may have.																		
																	


























FDA/USDA Belting



																		Terpco is able to provide your company with food grade, FDA/USDA approved belting. These belts work great when the food product is coming into contact with the belt.																		
																	


























PTFE/Silicone Belts



																		Taconic manufactures PTFE and silicone coated fiberglass belts that offer exceptional release properties, outstanding flexibility and superior temperature resistance. By designing and delivering the best belts possible, our customers can achieve both high performance and maximum value.
