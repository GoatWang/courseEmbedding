About
At a glance
Our culture
Social responsibility
Board






















Who we are
We are a leading global technology-enabled liquidity provider, specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs). We are able to grow our organization further, thereby ensuring that our trading desks in Europe, the Americas and Asia provide liquidity across all major exchanges, globally, 24 hours a day. Founded in 2004, we continue to cultivate the entrepreneurial, innovative and team-oriented culture that has been with us since the beginning.
What we do
As a technology company operating in a financial environment, we use our principal technology platform to quote bid and ask prices in thousands of ETP listings, as well as similar financial products. We also provide liquidity to institutional counterparties off-exchange across all regions: the Americas, APAC and EMEA. Market participants benefit from higher execution quality and lower overall trading costs, while the markets benefit from greater efficiency and more transparency. 
As a principal trading firm, we trade for our own account only. We do not have clients, nor do we provide any investment services or ancillary services to others. Our strategies are designed to use information that is publicly available and we use fairly simple, non-controversial and transparent order types. We are a strong supporter of fair, transparent and orderly markets.

 Our Culture & Perks



Our Culture
Unique, ‘one team’-driven culture 
Flow Traders fosters an entrepreneurial, innovative and strong team-oriented culture, which rewards people for their contributions to the company as a whole rather than only in their direct area of responsibility. Our culture is underpinned by the four-eyes principle and by disciplined risk awareness at every level of the organisation.
We strive for continuous improvement and hold ourselves to industry-leading compliance and regulatory standards. We have a strong track record in recruiting, developing and retaining talent. We nurture our unique ‘one team’ philosophy by stimulating the sharing of ideas and best practices through employee rotation both within and between our offices. The seamless integration of teamwork, ETP market expertise, risk management, technology and connectivity enables us to offer competitive pricing, while always remaining in control.
Our Culture & Perks
