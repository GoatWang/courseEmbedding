Satellite Communications

Description
Product Manager Satellite Communications (PdM SATCOM)  rapidly designs, acquires, fields and supports fully integrated, easy to  operate and cost effective tactical SATCOM and services that meet Joint network  communications requirements around the world. As part of the Army’s holistic  One Tactical Network, most of these terminals transmit voice, video and data  over the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) backbone. With  terminals ranging in size from a softside carry-on to a small house, the Army’s  global network of SATCOM capability provides interoperable high-speed,  high-capacity connectivity, so Soldiers can communicate across vast distances  and in austere locations and terrains, virtually anytime, anywhere.
 PdM  SATCOM is responsible for the Army's tactical multi-channel satellite ground  and commercial terminal programs. The product office specializes in  multi-frequency band (C, Ku, Ka and X Bands) satellite terminals. These  terminals provide commanders and Soldiers with assured and reliable  communications throughout the world using both commercial and military  satellite constellations. The program office also manages the Commercial SATCOM  Terminal Program (CSTP), which provides rapid non-program of record commercial  satellite communications systems to address challenges realized during current  operations and in advance of critical near-term requirements for the Army as well as joint services and other government  agencies.
The SATCOM systems in the portfolio support and  complement the Army’s   WIN-T network and  architecture and help increase the operational reach and situational awareness  of the entire force. As part of its modernization efforts, the Army continues  to improve current and future SATCOM systems to reduce size, weight and power  requirements, as well as increase throughput, network extension and operational  versatility.
