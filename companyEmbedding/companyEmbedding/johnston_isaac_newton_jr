"Building Winning Enterprises through Productivity©" Order book now 

How to Improve the value of your enterprise through proven productivity practices.  

Fortune 1000 enterprises, and privately owned businesses can increase the value (market cap) and competitiveness of their business by implementing strong productivity programs.   

"Building Winning Enterprises through Productivity©" walks through a five step approach to drive productivity across your entire enterprise.

The extensive productivity maturity™ assessment gauges where you stand today in productivity management, and more importantly points to the next opportunity areas.
 
The structured idea creation and enhancement process (SICE process™) walks through a method to identify and build out the best productivity ideas to focus against within each business segment, and across your entire enterprise, resulting in a specific multi-year pipeline of productivity initiatives including economics. 

The value of your business is based upon the amount of cash and profits you generate, and expect to generate in the future.  Simply, sales minus cost=profits. Profits times your earnings multiple = enterprise value. This book focuses exclusively on the cost side of your P&L equation to increase the value and competitiveness of your enterprise.

If you are the owner of a private business, are on the board, or in a senior executive position of a Fortune 1000 enterprise, you will benefit from the productivity approaches outlined. 

If you are a manager, an employee, or a student, you will benefit by understanding why productivity is important to your employer, and why you should participate in making the business you work for more productive

                                Report abuseTranscript of Newton's 3 Laws of MotionA brief History of The Study of MotionPeople have been curious about how things move for as long as history has been recorded.  Aristotle first proposed that all objects were naturally at a state of rest, until acted upon by a "force".  Over 400 years ago, my hero, Galileo Galilei, proposed that objects in motion are in an equally natural state. What Does This Mean?The short version: An object in its natural state of motion, will remain in that state, at a constant velocity, until an outside force acts upon the object.Newton's First Law of MotionEvery object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a straight line. As long as no net force acts on it.Newton (and Galileo) recognized that there are numerous unseen forces at play here on Earth. Newton's 3 Laws of MotionThis realization was the basis for Sir IsaacNewton's first law of motion.Throughout your life you will hear many different ways to define force...In Physics; Force refers to a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object. Contact Force: Consequence of PhysicalInteraction. Friction.Action-at-a-distance Force: Physcal contactis not required: Gravity.Newton's Second Law of MotionThe acceleration of an object is directlyproportional to the net force acting on it; and is inversely proportional to theobjects mass. Testing the LawNot being deterred by this, they measured the force of Gravity, by reducing the force of friction by rolling Bearings down inclined planes.Finding that, regardless of weight; the bearings would always reach the same height from where they originated.  (Conservation of Energy)http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.htmlNewton's Third Law of MotionWhenever an object exerts a forceon a second object, the second object exerts an equal force on the first object in the opposite directionWhat is Force?What Does This Mean?Simply stated: when you push against the wall you feel the wall  pushing back!When you pedal your bicycleall you do is turn the wheels.When the wheels exert force on the ground, the ground pushes back.This push-back is what makes the bicyclemove. (friction must be present) Fun Physics Video!!!You can only feel the forces exerted on you.You don't feel the force you exertFull transcriptMore presentations by
