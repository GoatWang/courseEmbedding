Current operations[edit]
The company's focus is on a method of oil extraction called enhanced oil recovery (tertiary recovery), which utilizes carbon dioxide to extract oil from fields that have been previously exploited.[1]
The company's operations are focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.[1]
As of December 31, 2016, Denbury had 254 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.55×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 97.5% was petroleum and 2.5% was natural gas.[1]
The company also has an estimated 1.3 trillion cubic feet of probable carbon dioxide reserves at Jackson Dome.[1]
The company's largest producing property is the Cedar Creek Anticline in Montana and North Dakota, which accounted for 25% of daily production in 2016.[1]
History[edit]
In March 1951, Denbury was incorporated in Manitoba as "Kay Lake Mines Limited (N.P.L.)".[2]
In September 1984, the name of the company was changed to "Newscope Resources Limited".[2]
In December 1985, the name of the company was changed to "Denbury Resources Inc."[2]
In May 1997, Denbury began trading on New York Stock Exchange.[1]
In 1998, Denbury acquired properties from Chevron for $202 million.[3]
In August 1999, Denbury began its enhanced oil recovery operations with the acquisition of the Little Creek Field.[1]
In 2001, Denbury acquired Matrix Oil & Gas for $138 million in cash and stock.[4]
In 2001, Denbury acquired the Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserves and the NEJD Pipeline in Mississippi, providing a source of carbon dioxide and the related transportation infrastructure.[1]
In 2010, Denbury acquired Encore Acquisition Company in a $4.6 billion transaction.[5][6]
In 2012, Denbury sold its acreage in the Bakken Formation to ExxonMobil for $1.6 billion.[7]
In 2013, Denbury acquired fields in the Cedar Creek Anticline from ConocoPhillips for $1.05 billion.[8]

Current operations[edit]
The company's focus is on a method of oil extraction called enhanced oil recovery (tertiary recovery), which utilizes carbon dioxide to extract oil from fields that have been previously exploited.[1]
The company's operations are focused in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.[1]
As of December 31, 2016, Denbury had 254 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.55×109 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 97.5% was petroleum and 2.5% was natural gas.[1]
The company also has an estimated 1.3 trillion cubic feet of probable carbon dioxide reserves at Jackson Dome.[1]
The company's largest producing property is the Cedar Creek Anticline in Montana and North Dakota, which accounted for 25% of daily production in 2016.[1]
History[edit]
In March 1951, Denbury was incorporated in Manitoba as "Kay Lake Mines Limited (N.P.L.)".[2]
In September 1984, the name of the company was changed to "Newscope Resources Limited".[2]
In December 1985, the name of the company was changed to "Denbury Resources Inc."[2]
In May 1997, Denbury began trading on New York Stock Exchange.[1]
In 1998, Denbury acquired properties from Chevron for $202 million.[3]
In August 1999, Denbury began its enhanced oil recovery operations with the acquisition of the Little Creek Field.[1]
In 2001, Denbury acquired Matrix Oil & Gas for $138 million in cash and stock.[4]
In 2001, Denbury acquired the Jackson Dome carbon dioxide reserves and the NEJD Pipeline in Mississippi, providing a source of carbon dioxide and the related transportation infrastructure.[1]
In 2010, Denbury acquired Encore Acquisition Company in a $4.6 billion transaction.[5][6]
In 2012, Denbury sold its acreage in the Bakken Formation to ExxonMobil for $1.6 billion.[7]
In 2013, Denbury acquired fields in the Cedar Creek Anticline from ConocoPhillips for $1.05 billion.[8]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Denbury Resources, Inc.


Challenge
Reducing Distractions and Protecting Speech Privacy in a Truly Open-Concept Space
When rapidly expanding independent oil and gas company Denbury Resources started construction on a new office building in Plano Texas, they wanted their new office space to be a physical representation of their collaborative and team-first company culture. Denbury desired a space that literally exemplified their company’s open-door policy – they wanted an interior space with no doors to private offices. Additionally, there were no cubicles and abundant amounts of open-space. Only conference rooms would have doors.
With such a bold vision comes privacy and noise concerns. A completely open office space with no cubicle partitions or office doors to block sound would mean that speech privacy would be compromised and noise distractions would be elevated. How could they retain their open concept vision but also create an acoustically comfortable environment?
To help solve the problem, Denbury consulted with a telecommunications integrator about introducing sound masking – the process of adding a low level, unobtrusive background sound to an environment to reduce the intelligibility of human speech and reduce noise distractions. By making nearby conversations unintelligible, sound masking protects speech privacy and allows individuals to work more productively.
Solution
QtPro™ Sound Masking System
Denbury Resources installed Cambridge Sound Management’s cost effective QtPro Sound Masking system to accommodate the acoustical requirements of their 750,000 square foot, three floor, seven building office complex. Small, barely visible emitters (speakers) were installed in the ceiling tiles throughout the entire space including open office staff work stations, conference rooms, corridors and common areas, and private offices. Emitters were also installed in the bathrooms to provide music and paging resources in these areas.
A more pleasant work environment
Not only has Denbury Resources been able to create greater privacy in their private offices and corridors, they have a more pleasant work environment with fewer distractions in open office areas as well.
“Utilizing sound masking from Cambridge Sound Management keeps the cross talk between the offices and corridors down so you don’t hear inter-office conversations. I highly recommend sound masking as a solution for open- concept office spaces.” – Steve Shanks, Manager of Audio, Video Surveillance and Security
“When the sound masking is turned off there is a huge different in the building. It’s one of those things that you don’t know it’s there until it’s gone.” – Michael Roberts, Audio Visual Engineer
About Denbury Resources, Inc.

The company is the largest oil and natural gas producer in both Mississippi and Montana, owns the largest reserves of carbon dioxide (CO2) used for tertiary oil recovery east of the Mississippi River, and holds significant operating acreage in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions. The company’s goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with its most significant emphasis on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations.

The IT department is divided into 2 main sections. IT Infrastructure and Support is supplemented by Systems Operations, Data Warehousing, and the IT Help Desk. IT Financial Systems is supported by the SAP Applications Group. The company makes SAP applications a high priority, and recently implemented SAP ECC 6.0 and SAP BI 7.0.

Its time to give a fresh look to Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR) and Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM)

By Heather Davidson -   July 25, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Denbury Resources Inc. (NYSE:DNR) observed rebound of 2.36% since bottoming out at $1.27 on Jul. 24, 2017. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -15.58% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -64.67% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -69.7% from $4.29 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 12, 2016, but are collecting gains at -57.24% for the past 12 months.
DNR Target Price Reaches $2.05
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to sell Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)’s shares projecting a $2.05 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)’s Sales Declined?
 DNR’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -15.8% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 41.4% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Denbury Resources Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -72.85%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 5.64%, and the sector’s average is 79.87%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:MXIM) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -10.42% since hitting a peak level of $49.7 on Jun. 09, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -2.69% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 15.43% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 19.52% higher from $37.25, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Oct. 13, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 7.56% for the past six months.
Analysts See Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. 3.36% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM) to grow. At recent closing price of $44.52, MXIM has a chance to add $3.36 or 7.55% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($47.88) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.6 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.04 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:MXIM) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 10.9%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 15.13%, annually.
Is MXIM Turning Profits into Returns?
 Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM)’s ROE is 26.52%, while industry’s is -23.56%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.04%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.’s ROA is 12.98%, while industry’s average is 2.3%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 9.34. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. Our primary focus is using CO2 in enhanced oil recovery (“CO2 EOR”), and our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential in the future, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.

About Cautionary Statements






Denbury is an independent oil and natural gas company with 254.5 MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2016, of which 97% is oil. Our primary focus is on enhanced oil recovery utilizing carbon dioxide (“CO2 EOR”), and our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions. Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming.

Denbury is unique among domestic oil and gas companies in that its primary corporate strategy and focus are aimed at developing significant stranded reserves of American oil from depleted reservoirs through CO2 EOR. In most U.S. oil fields, about 30% to 40% of the original oil in place is recoverable through primary and secondary methods, which can be increased to 50% to 60% with CO2 EOR. While the technology used in CO2 EOR may not be considered new, we apply several concepts learned over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the reservoirs.

We began our CO2 EOR operations in August 1999 when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD Pipeline in 2001. Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.

As part of our corporate strategy, we target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our ownership or use of CO2 reserves, oil fields and CO2 infrastructure. Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis on CO2 EOR.
