 Donald J. Shepard 1946— Biography



      Donald J. Shepard
      
      1946–
    











        Chairman of the executive board, AEGON N.V.
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1946.
    

      Education: University of Chicago, MBA.
    

      Family: Married Rosie (maiden name unknown).
    

      Career: Life Investors, 1970–1985, various positions;
      1985–1989, executive vice president and chief operating officer;
      AEGON USA, 1989–1992, president and chief executive officer;
      1992–2002, chairman, president, and chief executive officer; AEGON
      N.V., 2002–, chairman of the executive board.
    

      Address: AEGON N.V., AEGONplein 50, P.O. Box 202, 2501 CE The Hague, The
      Netherlands; http://www.aegon.com.
    

      ■ Donald J. Shepard, who earlier served as the first chairman,
      president, and chief executive officer (CEO) of AEGON USA, in April 2002
      took over as chairman of its parent company, AEGON N.V. A member of the
      Dutch-based company's executive board since 1992, Shepard replaced
      Kees J. Storm, who in his nine years as chairman aggressively transformed
      AEGON into one of the world's top life-insurance companies. For
      Shepard it was a tough act to follow. However, despite a worldwide
      economic downturn and the resulting weakness in financial markets, Shepard
      acquitted himself well, guiding AEGON through troubled times and expanding
      into new markets.
    

      In 2003, the first full year under Shepard's watch, AEGON
      N.V.'s net income increased by nearly 39 percent, rising to $2.25
      billion from $1.6 billion the previous year. Revenue in 2003 totaled $36
      billion, up almost 10 percent from about $32.8 billion in 2002.
      AGEON's net profit margin improved from 5 percent in 2002 to 6.3
      percent in 2003 but was still well below the 2001 profit margin of 7.5
      percent. In announcing AEGON N.V.'s financial results for 2003,
      Shepard observed in a company press release: "We feel better about
      business

      than a year ago. The profitability of our business has been strengthened
      by our actions to improve margins," as well as "improvements
      in the equity and credit markets" (March 12, 2004).
    

      BIGGEST OPERATING GROUP WAS IN THE UNITED STATES
    

      Although based in The Hague, capital of the Netherlands, AEGON N.V.
      conducted roughly 70 percent of its business in the early 2000s outside
      the tiny European country. By far its biggest operating group, AEGON USA,
      which Shepard headed for more than a decade, accounted in 2003 for just
      over 60 percent of its parent's total revenue, while operations in
      the Netherlands and the United Kingdom generated roughly 30 percent and
      7.5 percent of total net income, respectively. The company also maintained
      smaller operations in a number
       of other countries, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Spain, and
      Taiwan.
    

      Born in 1946 in the United States, Shepard in 1970 earned a
      master's degree in business administration from the University of
      Chicago. Shortly after receiving his degree, he went to work for Life
      Investors, an insurance holding company headquartered in Cedar Rapids,
      Iowa. Over the next 15 years, Shepard held a wide variety of management
      positions, gradually working his way into the company's top
      executive ranks. In 1985 he was appointed executive vice president and
      chief operating officer of Life Investors, which in 1982 had been sold by
      founder Ronald Jensen to AEGON N.V. for $200 million.
    

      At the end of the 1980s, when AEGON N.V. consolidated its far-flung U.S.
      holdings into AEGON USA, Shepard was named president and chief executive
      officer of the newly formed company. In 1992 he was given the added title
      of chairman of AEGON USA and joined the executive board of AEGON N.V. Over
      the next decade, under Shepard's direction, AEGON USA expanded
      aggressively, most notably acquiring the insurance units of Providian
      Corporation for roughly $3.5 billion in January 1997 and San
      Francisco-based Transamerica Corporation for $9.7 billion two years later.
      By the end of the 1990s AEGON USA, which was then headquartered in
      Baltimore, had moved into the top three American life insurance groups in
      terms of total assets and premiums written.
    

      ASSESSED 9/11'S IMPACT ON BUSINESS
    

      On September 11, 2001, while Shepard was still serving as chairman,
      president, and chief executive officer of AEGON USA, terrorists attacked
      America, delivering a blow to the country that was to have a widespread
      impact on the worldwide economy. In an interview with 
      
        Chief Executive
      
       magazine shortly after 9/11, Shepard predicted that business-security
      concerns in the wake of the attack were likely to lead to an overreaction,
      resulting in sharply reduced business travel. Although he said he expected
      the American business community would eventually get past the crisis, he
      suggested that important lessons might be learned from countries like
      Israel. "It's interesting to see that there are a number of
      successful businesses in Israel and they have had to deal with terrorism
      in the streets for a long time," he said (November 2001).
    

      Less than two months after the attack, AEGON N.V.'s supervisory and
      executive boards announced on November 8, 2001, that Shepard would succeed
      Kees J. Storm when the latter retired in April 2002. For Shepard, the
      timing of his appointment was less than auspicious; AEGON saw its
      capitalization fall 11 percent at the end of June 2002. As a result,
      Standard & Poor's announced that it would be forced to cut
      the company's credit rating unless AEGON could boost its capital.
      Dutch-based Vereniging AEGON, the insurer's largest shareholder,
      came to the rescue, announcing it would sell a 25 percent interest in the
      company in a bid to bolster AEGON's capitalization.
    

      AEGON'S NET INCOME FELL IN 2002
    

      The combined effects of weakness in the equity markets, low interest
      rates, and bond-credit defaults took their toll on AEGON N.V.'s
      bottom line in 2002. The company's net income fell to $1.6 billion,
      down more than 24 percent from $2.1 billion in 2001. Revenue in 2002,
      however, rose almost 15 percent to $32.7 billion from about $28.5 billion
      the previous year. In announcing AEGON's 2002 financial
      performance, according to a company news release, Shepard said: "By
      continuation of our strategy we are enhancing our distribution
      capabilities in existing and new markets to reach more customers while
      improving the operating efficiency of our organization" (March 6,
      2003).
    

      In a July 2003 interview with the 
      
        Wall Street Transcript
      
      , Shepard attributed increased competition in the international insurance
      market to changes in government policy and financial markets.
      "It's always been competitive," he said, "but
      we are now experiencing the most rapid changes to our business model in a
      generation." As examples of the changing competitive landscape,
      Shepard cited "greater cost efficiencies, changing product design
      and pricing [and] adjusting commissions and product benefits" (July
      22, 2003).
    

      At AEGON's November 2003 Analyst and Investor Conference in
      Orlando, Florida, Shepard elaborated on the important role played by
      distribution, which he called the insurer's "most important
      driver of growth," according to a report carried on the Fair
      Disclosure Wire (November 10, 2003). He said that key to AEGON's
      distribution strength in the United States and Netherlands, its two
      biggest markets, had been the company's multichannel distribution
      system. Shepard said AEGON was moving to introduce similar distribution
      systems in other markets.
    

      PERFORMANCE IMPROVED IN 2003
    

      In March 2004 Shepard announced sharply improved results for AEGON N.V. in
      2003. The insurer's profit jumped nearly 39 percent on an increase
      in sales of just under 10 percent. According to a company press release,
      Shepard credited the company's strategy of aggressively expanding
      its multi-channel distribution system into more and more of its markets.
      As an example he cited the successful implementation of that system into
      AEGON's Taiwan market. Looking ahead, he said the company was well
      positioned to strengthen its core activities in such new markets as China,
      Slovakia, and Spain. The insurer moved to gain a foothold in the Chinese
      market in mid-2002 when it reached agreement with China National
       Offshore Oil Corporation to launch a joint-venture life-insurance
      business in China, which opened for business in Shanghai in 2003. AEGON
      also use joint ventures to enter the Spanish market, reaching a strategic
      agreement in January 2004 with Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM), one
      of Spain's leading financial-services companies. Under the terms of
      the agreement, CAM's insurance subsidiary, Mediterraneo Vida, was
      to be spun off into a new holding company, to which AEGON would supply
      both its insurance-marketing expertise and a substantial infusion of
      capital.
    

      In August 2003 Shepard, along with eight other international
      insurance-company executives, was elected to the board of directors of the
      New York-based International Insurance Society. The AEGON chairman also
      served on the boards of directors of CSX Corporation, Baltimore Symphony
      Orchestra, Financial Services Roundtable, U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
      Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, and Walters Art Gallery. He also served
      as a trustee of Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System
      Corporation.

Donald J. Shepard Elected Vice Chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce







Tuesday, June 5, 2007 - 8:00pmWASHINGTON, DC—The United States Chamber of Commerce's board of directors today elected Donald J. Shepard as its vice chairman. The U.S. Chamber is the world's largest business federation representing more than 3 million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and region. Shepard is chairman of the executive board and CEO of AEGON N.V.
"Don understands the business community's role in advocating for government policies and legislation that support economic growth and prosperity," said Chamber President and CEO Tom Donohue. "Over the years, Don has proven his status as a visionary. He was one of the driving forces behind the creation of our groundbreaking Institute for Legal Reform. Going forward I know he will be a tireless champion for our competitiveness agenda: strengthening our human capital, bolstering our infrastructure, boosting our energy supplies, and making our capital markets more efficient." 
Shepard is one of the first American CEOs of a major European financial company. Netherlands-based AEGON is one of the world's largest insurance companies measured by market capitalization and assets, offering a variety of life insurance, pension, and investment products. Worldwide, AEGON employs 29,000 people with 13,000 U.S. employees. The insurer services tens of millions of customers in 20 markets with 65% of its market based in the United States.
Shepard began his career with Life Investors, Inc., an insurance holding company, in 1970. Serving in various management and executive functions with Life Investors, he became executive vice president and chief operating officer in 1985, a position he held until AEGON consolidated its other U.S. operations with Life Investors to form AEGON USA in 1989 when he was appointed chief executive officer. In 1992, he became a member of the executive board of AEGON N.V. and in April 2002 he was appointed chairman of the executive board and CEO.
Shepard has served on the U.S. Chamber's board of directors since 1998 and is currently a member of the Chamber's Executive/Budget Committee. He was treasurer of the Chamber from 2000 to 2003, during which time he was instrumental in the solidification and subsequent growth of the Chamber's financial position.
An Iowa native, Shepard holds an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. He serves as a member of the board of directors of PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., and CSX Corporation, and is a past chairman of the Financial Services Roundtable. He is a trustee of Johns Hopkins Medicine and Johns Hopkins University.
