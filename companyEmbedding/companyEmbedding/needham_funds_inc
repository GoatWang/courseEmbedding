Needham Aggressive Growth Fund

Retail Share: NEAGX | Institutional Share: NEAIX
Assets (03/31/17): $61M | Inception Date: 9/4/01

Investment Objective
The Needham Aggressive Growth Fund seeks long-term, tax-efficient capital appreciation by primarily investing in the equity securities of public companies with above-average prospective long-term growth rates.
More specifically, the Fund's investment style is to move early into emerging areas of rapid growth, to stay with the leaders in established growth markets and to exit or short areas and/or companies that the Fund believes can no longer sustain strong, above-average growth profitability.
Strategy

Invest in companies with:

Strong growth potential
Potential for higher operating margins
Long-term, sustainable growth
Disruptive products or services


Invest in companies addressing unmet needs
Invest in strong, incentivized management teams
Invest in companies that are underfollowed by Wall Street
Utilize shorting techniques to dampen volatility
Invests in venture-backed, post-IPO opportunities

Hedge Funds
Overview
The Needham Hedge Funds ("the Funds") offer the investment experience of Needham Asset Management, LLC, along with the extensive and focused equity investment analysis and expertise of Needham & Company, LLC.
The Funds are traditional long/short style investment limited partnerships that invest primarily in the equities of public emerging growth companies. The objective of the Funds is to maximize long-term capital appreciation by investing in the equities of growth companies. We focus on fundamental research and do not rely upon "technical" investing (based upon computer-based stock selection, technical analysis and charts), including "momentum" investing. Our strategy focuses on investments in companies with above-average, long-term growth rates, which we believe is a result of such companies being at the vortex of rapid and fundamental changes in the world economy driven by technological and demographic change. The Funds engage in short sales of stocks that we believe are overvalued and accumulate long positions in companies we believe are undervalued. In addition, the Funds may invest in the equity and equity-related securities of promising private companies. Most of our areas of investment, as seen below, focus on the benefits from the power of information technology.

Needham Aggressive Growth Fund

Retail Share: NEAGX | Institutional Share: NEAIX
Assets (03/31/17): $61M | Inception Date: 9/4/01

Investment Objective
The Needham Aggressive Growth Fund seeks long-term, tax-efficient capital appreciation by primarily investing in the equity securities of public companies with above-average prospective long-term growth rates.
More specifically, the Fund's investment style is to move early into emerging areas of rapid growth, to stay with the leaders in established growth markets and to exit or short areas and/or companies that the Fund believes can no longer sustain strong, above-average growth profitability.
Strategy

Invest in companies with:

Strong growth potential
Potential for higher operating margins
Long-term, sustainable growth
Disruptive products or services


Invest in companies addressing unmet needs
Invest in strong, incentivized management teams
Invest in companies that are underfollowed by Wall Street
Utilize shorting techniques to dampen volatility
Invests in venture-backed, post-IPO opportunities
