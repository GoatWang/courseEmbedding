Developed over several years in a close creative
partnership, the Thomas O’Brien Collection marks
an ambitious step forward for both designer and
company, in the breadth of the offering as well as
the defining of a new chapter of American Modern
style for the interior design marketplace.
The collection is presented as a diverse grouping of room essentials and one-of-a-kind style pieces, many inspired by O’Brien’s own travels and personal storehouse of modern and European antiques. Original upholstery shapes alone number in the dozens, highlighting the dedicated craftsmanship, innovation, and production capability coming from Century’s North Carolina workshops.

Lighting and industrial design are twin passions
for Thomas O’Brien that find expression in his
prolific collaboration with Visual Comfort & Co.
Twice-yearly introductions encompass architectural
lights and a range of original chandeliers as well as
table and floor lamps, all in a family of exceptional
hand-crafted finishes. In recent seasons O’Brien has
worked with luxurious materials such as rock crystal
and delicate blown glass in updated modern forms.
A number of specialty lamps designed each year
become collector’s editions. Select profiles are
available at lighting centers nationwide and
through Circa Lighting; the complete collection
may be surveyed at Aero.

O’Brien is the first brand designer to create
a tabletop collection for Reed & Barton, one of
the country’s oldest, most respected silversmith
companies. Charting new territory into fine china
and other products, the program is unprecedented
in scope and includes dinnerware, glassware and
crystal, stainless steel flatware, serving items, and
a full range of gifts and decorative accessories.
New introductions are added frequently. Recently
O’Brien has also contributed supplemental gift and
barware designs to the Reed & Barton label.
Products are available at finer boutiques
nationwide and at Aero.

O’Brien was the first brand designer to be
invited to create a signature collection for leading carpet merchant Safavieh. His line of hand-knotted carpets is exclusively produced in Nepal of finest handspun Tibetan wool and genuine silk, with
recent introductions adding more transitional
carpets in natural undyed wool. Designs share a patterned, vintage inflection, in a range of unusual textile-based motifs, abstract Moroccan geometrics, Chippendale-inspired fretworks, and lavish freeform florals. All are available through Safavieh and other fine carpet showrooms nationwide, and at Aero.

Groundworks, a division of Lee Jofa, introduced
Thomas O’Brien’s first classically-inspired fabric
collection in 2003. Textiles are a favorite O’Brien
artifact and many of his designs for Groundworks
have originated in his personal library of vintage
fabrics and historical patternwork. O’Brien has since
delivered a second, bold collection including
several modernist prints, and following that, a large
trimmings group. His latest introduction reinvents
luxurious velvets and silks for modern, understated
use, in a range of signature, rich neutrals and earth
tones. All may be ordered through Lee Jofa,
Aero, or individual designers.

In 1999 O’Brien became the first brand designer to
create a featured line of products for luxury bath
leader Waterworks. That collection, Aero, continues
to be a best seller and has expanded with new
finishes. O’Brien has also produced the popular
Aero Retro and Industrial Luxe collections for
Waterworks and is at work on a new collection
to be introduced in tktk. All are on view at
Waterworks showrooms nationwide.

O’Brien has been creating fine furniture since
1999 for North Carolina-based Hickory Chair. His
collections span traditional and modern styles
and continue to expand with custom finishes and
specialized detailing as part of Hickory Chair’s
highly crafted made-to-order offering. From the
warm modern trademark of his debut to the more
neoclassical and later modernist influences of
successive collections, O’Brien’s furniture always
celebrates history and can be used in all types
of cross-combinations as well as with antiques.
Recent introductions synthesize elegant furniture
profiles from favorite French Deco and Regency
design periods into pieces with usable
scale and comfort for today.

Launched in 2005, O’Brien’s Vintage Modern
program for Target has been one of the retailer’s
most successful designer collections; a modern
fashion brand for the home. This large offering has
covered virtually all home categories in the store,
from bedding to dishes, carpets, lighting, furniture,
stationery, and holiday decor. O’Brien’s popular
towels have routinely been best sellers, in
remarkable quality cotton and a variety of warm
neutral colors. Across this product range, O’Brien
has maintained his familiar style rooted in
modernism, softened by traditional details and
an easy array of reinvented vintage patterns.

About Thomas
“I like practical and useful
things as well as fine and
rare things…”
Thomas O’Brien is an interior and home furnishings
designer based in New York City. He is the founder
and President of Aero Studios, one of America’s
leading design firms, and the proprietor of Aero
Ltd., the iconic home boutique that is the retail
face of the studio, open to the public at the
same address.
Since establishing Aero in 1992, O’Brien has
been celebrated for translating modernism into
a warm and livable style. From private residences
to commercial properties, product design to
brand and fine art consulting, his work is known
for its collected, vintage elegance, even as it is
sympathetic to the most practical ideas of home.
His sense of the modern comes from filtering
together elements from different historical origins,
in combinations that can seem at once familiar
and revealing: the shared simplicity between
20th century and classical forms; the balance
of rustic and refined, comfort and rarity.
In such connections and in his love of the local
O’Brien is an American designer at heart. He draws
from the farmhouse as much as the townhouse,
and he is a lifelong student of American vernacular
antiques and architecture as a foil for modern
generations of design. His mix of the modern and
traditional extends to the eponymous Thomas
O’Brien brand of home furnishings, with furniture,
lighting, tableware, textiles, carpets, and bedding
and bath collections for both fine and daily living.
As both merchant and designer, O’Brien chooses
the old-world model of a design enterprise: keeping
a one-of-a-kind store with a curated viewpoint
as the anchor to a popular lifestyle brand. This
approach allows him to continually create a world
unto itself for people to discover, and a laboratory
in which to work out the ideas that find their way
into his many projects and interiors.
Thomas O’Brien published his first, best-selling
book, American Modern, in 2010. His follow-up,
Aero: Beginning to Now, was published
in 2013. He lives in New York City and Long Island.

A PERSONAL HISTORY

 Whenever I am asked about the work of what I do, I tend to point out that, basically, I ama shopkeeper and a homemaker.
My designing comes out of those twin worlds, public and private, and makes up the two parts of the business that is Aero: a studio and a store. I am lucky to create homes and the products that go into them. And now, this online Aero that is a different window onto those worlds. A third way in design that is both immediate and as meandering and full of discovery as an actual walk through the physical place of Aero, in New York City.
I’d always dreamed of living in New York. Eventually I did come here to go to art school; to study at the museums, absorb the architecture. Both this city and the wonderful training I received exist in the way I think about design. The location of Aero was chosen for its connection to the downtown world of artists and galleries that I first witnessed during school. Our first clients and many since have come from that world of creative arts. We started here and we are still here, twenty years later.
Designing anything, from the details of a lamp to the interiors of a whole estate, is still an art project to me. It is always a learning process: fun, hopeful, considered, and a little bit reverent. It is to know the past in order to invent something new for the time of now.


Designing beautiful graphics and typography; taking constant pictures; writing fine words… these are parts of the art project, too. I have always been interested in graphic design, printworks, storytelling, and of course, photography. And these elements have always been part of how Aero has been presented over the years. I am endlessly fascinated with the idea of the library and frequently build ones for my clients (both the room and the collection). I have written two books of my own. It may be old fashioned in one way, but I still like the true object of a piece of film, ora book, or an elegant sheet of stationery. Or, the singular location of a special store and the collections in it. These things slow us down. They turn us away from the ever-present screens and speed of modern life. They hold history. They are personal.
The challenge, and the art, of making Aero exist online was to capture something of those physical layers and history: to invite you to slow down and wander through stories and among pictures. To linger and to return. I think of it as a new kind of library. A shop in the making.And a home away from home. Welcome.

  Thomas O’Brien on Thomas O’Brien |
  Chicago magazine
      | Design Dose May 2010
    




 
 


Interiors and product designer and head of New York-based Aero Studios Thomas O’Brien gave a great talk last Friday at the Merchandise Mart promoting his new book, American Modern. Jan Parr and I (along with one of our contributors, Tate Gunnerson who wrote a nice synopsis of the lecture here were all very taken with one line in particular: “Everything was modern in its own time.” This sort of historical perspective is what makes O’Brien such an interesting designer—and person. He talked a lot about contextualization, or thinking about a home’s age when decorating it. In his Long Island house, a converted boys’ academy that was built in the 1830s, he tried to create a kitchen that felt like it could have been around during the home’s younger years (say, in the ’20s) and he consciously collects artifacts from that era as well, such as books published the year the house was built. I also liked seeing how his personal decorating style has evolved. At one point, his Manhattan condo was pristine, cream, and rather minimal. Very sophisticated, but not particularly daring. Then, he decided to embrace clutter and non-conformity, moving his bed into the living room and covering every surface with art and memorabilia. It’s refreshing to see that designers, too, sometimes need time to come out of their shells and live in a way that feels true to them.
