BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Raymond James has hired Jonathan Knauss as a managing director for its financial services investment banking practice. Previously, Knauss worked at Hovde Group where he was head of the diversified financials group.
PRESS RELEASE
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – Raymond James is adding resources to its Financial Services Investment Banking practice with the addition of Jonathan Knauss as managing director. A veteran of the middle market, Knauss will serve clients in the specialty finance sector.
“Jonathan is a highly skilled and experienced banker with an impressive track record of transactions across the financial services industry,” said Jim Bunn, senior managing director and head of Investment Banking at Raymond James. “We’re continuing to see increased levels of deal activity in financial services and Jonathan’s expertise in the sector gives us additional capabilities to grow our advisory and underwriting services in this space.”
Knauss is based in Chicago and joins Raymond James from Hovde Group where he was head of the diversified financials group. He previously headed the specialty finance investment banking practice at BMO Capital Markets and began his investment banking career at A.G. Edwards.
The addition of Knauss continues the measured growth of Raymond James’ Financial Services practice which provides strategic advisory and equity and debt capital formation. Over the past several years, Raymond James hired multiple senior professionals to support this growing practice and added new capabilities, including mutual-to-stock-conversions for thrifts and mutual insurance companies as well as Fixed Income origination and syndication for financial institutions of all types. Deal flow has been strong as the group has advised on 17 M&A transactions announced or closed this year and executed 22 securities offerings during 2017. 





“This is a first-class team of professionals who are truly committed to the clients’ best interest,” said Knauss. “The growth orientation of Raymond James is especially well suited to the dynamic specialty finance sector in which I focus. There’s a lot of opportunity in the sector now and we don’t see that slowing anytime soon, so I expect to be busy.”

Family Offices










You’ve acquired many blessings, now you have to choose your opportunities wisely.
The family offices we serve range in size from $25 million to $2 billion under management.  Most of the family offices we serve have been established by successful entrepreneurs, who have made their money on their own, but didn’t make it managing money.  Therefore, they’ve asked us and a collection of professionals to team with them.
The market is full of investment ideas, both public and private.  There’s now an overload of information at our fingertips, it’s often hard to understand the value and opportunity through all of the noise.  Families and family offices understand there are no monopolies on good ideas, but it’s hard to identify the good from the bad.  Through our networks, client base, and strategic partners, we have established relationships with a select few family offices to provide quality ideas and investment recommendations according to their specifications.
Our Core Services provided to Family Offices:

Short Term Cash Management, or Cash Solutions
Researched-Based Investment (either growth or income-related) through a Custom Structured Product
Access to RJ Institutional Investment Research
Cost Analysis and Fee Negotiation
Ongoing Performance Monitoring and Recommendations to the Investment Committee

While we can’t share specifics due to confidentiality contracts, we can provide a number of case studies upon request.

Wealth AdvisorDirect: 770.673.2154


MAX.DEAN@RAYMONDJAMES.COM





 

 


Max is a managing partner with Bespoke Wealth Management of Raymond James. With previous experience in corporate America and equities research, Max’s main role on the team is financial modeling and scenario analysis. As our clients prepare to sell their business, prepare for retirement, or have basic planning needs, Max constructs a personalized plan around their situation to help answer tough questions.  Max has earned the accreditation of a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ which is widely considered the gold standard among financial advisors. Ultimately, the team’s goal is to achieve financial success through professional advice, sound risk management, quality investment products, and personal, efficient service.
Max hails from the great state of Ohio. As both of his parents were doctors, Max had a great deal of exposure to the medical industry but was always destined for the finance field. At the age of 14, Max opened his first IRA after being presented with a compounded interest illustration in math class.
Max graduated magna cum laude from Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business while also being the captain of the wrestling team. After several marketing positions, he acquired his MBA in finance and entrepreneurship from the University Of Oklahoma’s Price School of Business. After a short stint on Wall Street in 2008, Max worked at telecom giant AT&T for over four years, where he was consistently recognized as a top performer.
Max has been heavily involved in small groups and youth ministry at Buckhead Church, is a founding member of Wrestlers In Business (a local 501c3), volunteers as a wrestling coach at The Lovett School, and is involved in both the Oklahoma and Indiana alumni associations. Favorite activities include trips to Hartwell and Lanier, weight lifting, and running events.  He lives in the Chastain Park area with his wife Katherine and their dog Moe.






 
 
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. owns the certification marks CFP®, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, CFP® (with plaque design) and CFP® (with flame design) in the U.S., which it awards to individuals who successfully complete CFP Board’s initial and ongoing certification requirements.








                    WHY WORK WITH A CFP®


In life, it’s important to find a financial planner you trust to provide sound, unbiased advice and professional services. Being CFP® certified means someone has voluntarily taken the extra steps needed to provide the highest possible standard of financial planning to those they serve. To become a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional one must pass the comprehensive CFP® Certification Exam, have a minimum of three years’ professional experience in financial planning process and must be approved by the CFP Board, which involves an extensive background check – including an ethics, character and criminal check. To maintain certification, CFP® license holders must complete 30 hours of continuing education accepted by the CFP Board every two years.
How does working with a CFP® certified advisor benefit you? CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professionals are held to the utmost standards of ethics and professional responsibility, which prepares them for a career-long commitment to provide truly personalized services to meet your needs; all while maintaining high levels of financial planning and professionalism. CFP® professionals maintain their professional edge through ongoing education and training in addition to the rigorous requirements to represent a high level of integrity, objectivity, competence, fairness, confidentiality, professionalism and diligence when working with you.

About Raymond James

 


Our "about us"
is really about you.

We have always been a different kind of financial services firm, embracing long-term planning, valuing methodical decision-making and remaining focused on what matters most: You.













About Us 


When Bob James founded Raymond James, he did so based on a belief that clients deserved more than help with investment decisions, they needed advice that considered their entire financial picture.
Today, that client-focused approach has extended to serve more than 3 million client accounts through 7,200 financial advisors in the United States, Canada and overseas. Further, the company has expanded through the years to serve corporations, institutions and municipalities through significant capital markets, banking and asset management services.


No matter the business, we believe if we do what’s right for clients,
we’ll help them achieve success while also realizing our own.
It’s that simple.

Working with a Raymond James Advisor
It starts by being personal.
Your relationship with a Raymond James advisor begins with a meaningful conversation – about you. Your goals, your wants, your needs, your concerns, your family, your passion, your vision for the future. It’s about working together to understand the strategies and services that will give you the optimal chance to fulfill your objectives – to live the life you want.
Next, you and your advisor will develop a comprehensive plan.
 Just like you, your plan is unique. It will be customized to help you reach major milestones – the ones you know are coming, and perhaps a few you haven’t considered yet. With comprehensive, institutional-quality resources, your advisor can provide a wide array of wealth management services, from investment strategies backed by award-winning research to estate planning vehicles that ensure your wishes are carried out exactly as you intend.
In implementing the plan, your advisor will work in collaboration with other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants, to assure your financial plan is holistic – all aspects working together. Through Investor Access, you will have online access to up-to-date account information, all while your accounts and information are protected by cybersecurity technology that goes well beyond the industry standard.
Through the years, your plan will evolve with you.
 The relationship with your advisor will grow deeper as you monitor the progress of your investments and review your strategy. Life events might require adjustments. Whatever the need, whatever phase of life you are in, your advisor will see you through.

Working with a Raymond James advisor means you have more than a financial planner. 
You have a trusted financial partner – for life.

What Makes Us Different




Why a Raymond James Advisor
Trust builds from an understanding of what’s most important to you. And with a relationship that deepens over time. When you work with a Raymond James advisor, your plan is individual. Personal. And built for the long term. Each advisor is empowered with the latest technology so you get the information you need, when you need it, from virtually anywhere. From tracking all of your accounts in one secure place to access to industry-leading research, it all starts right here.
Learn More


About Raymond James
Our deliberate nature and thoughtful approach to financial planning have led to a history of strength and steady, stable growth. Our company’s conservative approach began in 1962 when Robert James put the word “Investments” after his name. And since then, Raymond James advisors have been crafting meticulously tailored, holistic financial plans to help ensure their clients can retire and realize their individual financial goals.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.
