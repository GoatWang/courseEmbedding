Choosing to Formula-Feed
 



      Share:    

 






There are many reasons a mother may decide formula feeding is the best option for providing her child with the basic nutrition requirements needed for proper growth and development. Here are some helpful tips to use when choosing formula for your baby.
 
Nine out of ten mothers use formula.
According to a recent study, most new mothers (9 out of 10, actually) use formula at some point during their baby's first year. So you're not alone, not by a long shot.
Women are choosing formula feeding for many reasons.
Either mom or baby has physical or medical issues.
She can't pump or breastfeed after returning to work.
She wants Dad and other family members to be a part of feeding.
There are many formula options for your baby.
You can feel good knowing that there are some excellent formula options out there. Look for the ones that are specially formulated to nourish your baby's brain and eye development and immune health.
What to look for in an infant formula:
Different brands of formulas have different levels of DHA, ARA and choline, key nutrients found in breast milk. Look for a formula with expert-recommended levels of these important building blocks for your baby's brain and eyes.
Most babies thrive on a formula with whole proteins. Breast milk has whole proteins in it, and you want your formula to be as close to breast milk as possible.
Your formula should satisfy your baby's basic nutrition requirements and provide the balanced nutrition your baby needs, including calcium and antioxidants.
Smart Formula Nutrition

*Average level of DHA in worldwide breast milk is 0.32% +/- 0.22% (mean +/- standard deviation of total fatty acids) based on an analysis of 65 studies of 2,474 women.
†As calculated from the mean choline content of human milk determined by the Institute of Medicine.
‡Similac and Advance are registered trademarks of an entity unrelated to Mead Johnson & Company.

Non-GMO* Formulas: Commonly Asked Questions
 Non-GMO* Formulas: Commonly Asked Questions





We recently introduced Enfamil PREMIUM® and Enfagrow PREMIUM™ formulas, which are all non-GMO. While the addition of non-GMO formulas expands the variety of products to choose from, parents can remain confident in the safety and nutrition of all our Enfamil® products.
Below are a few commonly asked questions about these new products. If you have additional questions about our Enfamil PREMIUM® Newborn, Enfamil PREMIUM® Infant, Enfamil PREMIUM® Gentlease®, Enfagrow PREMIUM™ Toddler Transitions® and Enfagrow PREMIUM™ Toddler Next Step™ products – or any of our Enfamil formulas – you can call us at 1-800-BABY123, Mon-Fri 7am-7pm CST; Sat 8am-4:30pm CST. Or email us at EnfamilResourceCenter@Enfamil.com
What non-GMO products are available?
The following products are available in retail locations nationwide:
Enfamil PREMIUM® Newborn powder tub and ready to use bottles
Enfamil PREMIUM® Infant powder tub and ready to use bottles
Enfamil PREMIUM® Gentlease® powder tub (Enfamil PREMIUM® Gentlease® ready to use bottles will be non-GMO by the end of the year)
Enfagrow PREMIUM™ Toddler Transitions®
Enfagrow PREMIUM™ Toddler Next Step™ – Natural Milk 32 fl oz bottles
Coming Soon: Enfagrow PREMIUM™ Toddler Next Step™ – Natural Milk powder can
Parents can also buy these products on shop.enfamil.com or by calling us at 1-800-BABY123.
What are GMOs? Are they safe to consume?
A GMO – or Genetically Modified Organism – often refers to ingredient materials that have been altered by using gene-splicing techniques in order to introduce a desirable trait. A broad range of health professionals and scientists, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the American Medical Association, and the World Health Organization agree that the genetically modified foods and ingredients currently available and on the market today are safe to consume.
What does "non-GMO" mean?
There is no single accepted definition for the term "non-GMO." Mead Johnson uses the term "non-GMO" to mean that the ingredients have come from sources that have not been genetically engineered or created through biotechnology/gene splicing.
How are you able to assure that your products are non-GMO?
We work with our suppliers to confirm that the ingredients they supply for these Non-GMO Enfamil® products have come from non-GMO sources – which means the source of the ingredient is not genetically engineered.
What does the disclosure regarding the potential for the presence of trace amounts of genetically engineered material in the products mean?
We work with our suppliers to source non-GMO ingredients for our formulas. However, there are a number of ways that trace amounts of genetically engineered materials (often referred to as GMO) might be present in our products, such as manufacturing proximity, fermentation and processing aids or enzymes used in production. Mead Johnson takes steps to limit the potential for the inadvertent introduction of genetically engineered materials material during our production processes, such as segregating non-GMO ingredients and flushing or cleaning the production lines before non-GMO formulations are manufactured, but Mead Johnson recognizes that our efforts and those of our suppliers cannot ensure the complete absence of genetically engineered materials.
It is also important to note that almost all animal feed in the U.S. is genetically modified, which means that dairy-derived ingredients in our non-GMO products are likely to come from animals that were given some feed that was made with genetically engineered materials. This is common in many other non-GMO foods.
Are your non-GMO products safer or more nutritious than your other Enfamil products?
No. Our Enfamil PREMIUM Newborn, Enfamil PREMIUM Infant, Enfamil PREMIUM Gentlease, Enfagrow PREMIUM Toddler Transitions and Enfagrow PREMIUM Toddler Next Step have the same nutritious and high-quality ingredients as existing Enfamil Newborn, Enfamil Infant, Enfamil Gentlease and Enfagrow Toddler Next Step varieties. The difference between the two is how some of these ingredients are sourced. Both varieties are part of Enfamil Staged Nutrition, inspired by the changing nutrition of breast milk and, like all other Enfamil® formulas, have nutrients for healthy growth and brain-nourishing DHA.
Why not convert all your formula products to non-GMO?
Through our consumer research, we know that some parents are interested in non-GMO versions of our products, while others are not. That’s why we are providing parents with a variety of choices. While the addition of our Enfamil PREMIUM Newborn, Enfamil PREMIUM Infant, Enfamil PREMIUM Gentlease, Enfagrow PREMIUM Toddler Transitions and Enfagrow PREMIUM Toddler Next Step products expands the variety of products to choose from, parents can continue to be confident in the safety and nutritional benefits of all of our Enfamil products.
*Ingredients not genetically engineered. Trace amounts of genetically engineered material may be present in the product, such as from manufacturing environments and process sources.

For more than a century, Mead Johnson has led the way in developing safe, high-quality, innovative products to help meet the nutritional needs of infants and children. Click on a brand below to explore our family of products.




















Enfamil





Enfamil® and its family of formulas including Enfagrow®, Enfakid® and Enfapro®, are scientifically-designed to meet the nutritional needs of newborns, infants, toddlers and children. Enfamil’s full product portfolio is formulated to provide optimal nutrition and to support brain development. Following a staged approach, each formula is intended for use as part of a balanced diet while providing the nutrients needed for healthy physical growth and development during the first critical days of life, up to toddler and school age.
History
Introduced in 1959, Enfamil was Mead Johnson’s first routine formula designed to be patterned after the nutritional composition of breast milk. Since then, the product has undergone several significant reformulations and has evolved into a global family of science-based formulas tailored to the changing nutritional needs of children. Today, Enfamil formulas are trusted by parents and healthcare professionals and enjoyed by children around the world, in countries such as Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
Innovations
Mead Johnson’s steadfast commitment to infant nutrition research has led to a series of innovative formulation improvements over the years. In 2002, Mead Johnson launched Enfamil LIPIL®, which included DHA and ARA, and is clinically-proven to benefit infants in the areas of brain and eye development. By 2010, the product also included nutrients needed for healthy physical growth and development, including Natural Defense™ Dual Prebiotics, designed to help support a baby’s own defenses.
Beyond Enfamil’s routine staged formulas, Mead Johnson developed a series of products that are formulated for the most fragile of newborns and low-birth weight infants. Mead Johnson's Enfamil Premature products provide levels of nutrients and DHA for this fragile population.
Today, the Enfamil brand is trusted by parents and healthcare professionals around the world – providing optimal nutrition for infants and children through every stage of development.

Choco Milk





Choco Milk®, a leading nutritional milk supplement, has become one of the best-loved milk modifiers for kids in Mexico and continues to grow in popularity in the Southwest United States. Parents love it for its vitamin-rich offering, while kids love it for its creamy, chocolaty taste.
History
Launched in 1928 as the first milk modifier in Mexico, Choco Milk has evolved into one of the most popular fortified drinks in that country. In 2000, the product went through a series of reformulations, including an enhanced formulation to meet the changing nutritional demands of children. Celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2003, Choco Milk today is offered in a variety of flavors including chocolate, strawberry, cinnamon, banana and Neapolitan.
Innovations
In 2000, Choco Milk was reformulated from 17 to 20 vitamins, increasing the amount of nutrients in each serving. Today, the leading nutritional milk supplement contains a unique formula with 23 vitamins and minerals and is available in five delicious flavors kids love.











Lactum





Lactum® is a scientifically-formulated milk supplement designed to provide 100 percent of the daily nutrients needed when combined with three regular meals based on the nutritional recommendations of the Food Pyramid guidelines in the Philippines.  Lactum helps parents provide proper nutritional supplements for kids, ensuring essential nutrients are incorporated into their diet.
Available in natural or plain milk and chocolate milk flavors, Lactum’s children’s milk formulas  target the unique nutritional needs of children during specific stages of development: from 1 to 3 years, 3 years to 6 years, and for school-aged children 6 years and older. The same product is available throughout the world under different brand names, including: Lactum (in the Philippines), Sustagen (in Malaysia and Indonesia) and Alacta (in Thailand).
History
First introduced in the 1980s as a certified formula marketed to healthcare professionals, Lactum became commercially available in 1991. In 1995, Lactum was repositioned to what it is today as an alternative to full cream milks available in the market and scientifically formulated to deliver essential nutrients to children with picky eating habits.
Over the next decade, the product went through several modifications in order to improve its nutritional value, including in 2002 when Mead Johnson re-launched Lactum from a single product to a unified franchise with specific-staged products to cater to the nutritional needs of children during specific stages of development. At that time, Lactum became available as Lactum 1+ and 3+, and again in 2005 when Mead Johnson introduced Lactum 6+.
Innovations
Mead Johnson’s steadfast commitment to children’s nutrition research led to innovative formulation improvements over the years designed to offer the best possible nutrition. In 2002, Lactum launched as a staged milk formula with the introduction of a full portfolio of vitaminized, ready-to-drink (RTD) products that cater to the changing nutritional needs of out-and-about and busy school-going children. In 2007, Lactum re-launched with prebiotics, DHA and inulin in order to strengthen its nutritional offering. Lactum is currently available in the Philippines and is sold under the Sustagen brand name in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Nutramigen





Nutramigen® is designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and young children with food allergies or colic due to cow’s milk protein sensitivities. Nutramigen contains a milk protein that is broken down into tiny pieces to virtually eliminate allergic reactions. This extensively hydrolyzed protein has been widely studied and is clinically proven effective for cow’s milk protein allergy. In addition, Nutramigen works fast (often within 48 hours) to quiet diet-related colic due to cow's milk protein allergy. Nutramigen also has DHA and ARA – two nutrients found in breast milk that are the building blocks for a baby’s brain and eyes.
History
Mead Johnson developed Nutramigen in 1942 to cater to the needs of infants with allergies to cow’s milk protein and was the first protein-hydrolysate infant formula available in the United States. Nutramigen today is the most widely studied formula for the dietary management of allergic manifestations.
After nearly 70 years, infants with food allergies or protein sensitivities have managed their conditions successfully with Nutramigen. Today, the formula is widely available in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and North America.
Innovations
After nearly 70 years of research and innovation to the Nutramigen line, the product remains one of the leading infant formulas in the United States for children with milk allergies. In 2009, Mead Johnson introduced Nutramigen with Enflora™ LGG in the United States that included the addition of Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG – also known as LGG. LGG is the widely-studied probiotic, with more than 40 clinical trials conducted in infants and children. The first to use this extensive array of scientific support, Mead Johnson added LGG to Nutramigen to help the strength of the intestinal barrier of the allergic infant. To date, thousands of infants with cow’s milk protein allergies have benefited from the dual action of Nutramigen with LGG, not only to reduce allergen exposure, but also to support a healthy stomach.











Sustagen





Sustagen® is a nutritionally-balanced milk supplement for children. Available in plain, vanilla, honey and chocolate flavors, Sustagen’s children’s milk formulas target the unique nutritional needs of children during specific stages of development: from 1 to 2 years, 3 years and older, and for school-aged children 6 years and older.
History
Originally introduced as a tube- and oral-feeding product in the 1950s, Sustagen evolved into the only brand within the Mead Johnson portfolio for both children and adults. By the 1980s, Mead Johnson released Sustagen Kids, a supplement that provided the daily recommended amount of nutrients, including iron and vitamin C, for kids up to 12 years.
Innovations
In the 1990s, Sustagen Kids was launched with high levels of iron and vitamin C. In order to fulfill 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of nutrients for children, Mead Johnson also included 26 additional vitamins and minerals to the formula.
In 2008, Sustagen was reformulated in the Philippines to deliver 100 percent of the daily nutrients needed by children, when combined with three regular meals, based on the nutritional recommendations provided by the Philippines' Food Pyramid guidelines.
Today, Sustagen is enjoyed by adults and children throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Central America, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Venezuela.

Mead Johnson Nutrition is a leading manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company dates back to a firm created by Edward Mead Johnson, one of the co-founders of Johnson & Johnson, who created his own business in 1895, which was renamed Mead Johnson & Company in 1905. The company was majority owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb after an acquisition in 1967, but was spun off in 2009 as an independent firm.
In the year end 31 December 2016, Mead Johnson reported net sales of $3,743 million. Fifty percent of those sales were generated in Asia, 17% in Latin America and 33% in North America/Europe. For the same time period, the company reported total assets of $4,088 million.
In February 2017, British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (RB) bid $16.7 billion for the company.[1]
On June 15, 2017 MJN announced that its merger with Reckitt Benckiser (RB) had been completed. As a result, MJN's common stock is no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange, effective the announcement date.[2]

History and products[edit]




Dextri-Maltose and Pablum, early Mead Johnson products


Edward Mead Johnson had founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886 together with his brothers. In 1895, Johnson developed a side business called The American Ferment Company to create a digestive aid. In 1897, E. Mead Johnson left the family business to go out into business on his own in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1905, the company was re-established as Mead Johnson & Company.[3] The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be clinically approved and recommended by doctors. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.[3]
Edward Mead Johnson died in 1934, and Lambert Mead Johnson succeeded his father as president, and served in the position until 1955, making him the longest-serving president in company history.[3] D. Mead Johnson was the third generation of the family to serve as chief executive of the firm. During his tenure, which lasted from 1955 until the firm's takeover by Bristol-Myers in 1968, the firm's annual sales tripled to $131 million, and grew to nearly 4,400 employees.[4]
Acquisition and spin-off from Bristol-Myers[edit]
Bristol-Myers reached agreement in August 1967 for a deal under which Mead Johnson would be acquired, with shareholders receiving a mix of common and preferred stock in a deal valued at $240 million. Mead Johnson's net sales in 1966 were $131 million with earnings of $7.3 million.[5]
Bristol-Myers announced in February 2009 that it was going to spin off Mead Johnson to focus on its primary pharmaceutics business, with an initial public offering estimated to bring in $562.5 million and would leave Bristol-Myers with 90% ownership of the firm.[6] A plan offered in November 2009 would allow shareholders of Bristol-Myers to exchange one dollar of stock in that company for $1.11 worth of shares in Mead Johnson for the 133.5 million shares in the firm, which would value the company at $7.7 billion based on the stock's then current closing price. The stock swap was intended to provide a tax-free exchange. CEO James M. Cornelius of Bristol-Myers said that "With a successful execution of this split-off, we fully consider ourselves a BioPharma company".[7]
Acquisition by Reckitt Benckiser[edit]
In February 2017 it was announced that Reckitt Benckiser was in advanced negotiations to acquire Mead Johnson.[8][9] On February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser Group announced it had agree to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.[10]
RB's intention was to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. In order to effect the transaction, RB incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition has merged, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the surviving entity at completion.[11]
Mead Johnson announced on June 12, 2017 that the final regulator approval to complete the acquisition had been received. On June 15, 2017 the merger was completed and Mead Johnson became the Infant and Child Nutrition (IFCN) Division of RB.

History and products[edit]




Dextri-Maltose and Pablum, early Mead Johnson products


Edward Mead Johnson had founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886 together with his brothers. In 1895, Johnson developed a side business called The American Ferment Company to create a digestive aid. In 1897, E. Mead Johnson left the family business to go out into business on his own in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1905, the company was re-established as Mead Johnson & Company.[3] The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be clinically approved and recommended by doctors. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.[3]
Edward Mead Johnson died in 1934, and Lambert Mead Johnson succeeded his father as president, and served in the position until 1955, making him the longest-serving president in company history.[3] D. Mead Johnson was the third generation of the family to serve as chief executive of the firm. During his tenure, which lasted from 1955 until the firm's takeover by Bristol-Myers in 1968, the firm's annual sales tripled to $131 million, and grew to nearly 4,400 employees.[4]
Acquisition and spin-off from Bristol-Myers[edit]
Bristol-Myers reached agreement in August 1967 for a deal under which Mead Johnson would be acquired, with shareholders receiving a mix of common and preferred stock in a deal valued at $240 million. Mead Johnson's net sales in 1966 were $131 million with earnings of $7.3 million.[5]
Bristol-Myers announced in February 2009 that it was going to spin off Mead Johnson to focus on its primary pharmaceutics business, with an initial public offering estimated to bring in $562.5 million and would leave Bristol-Myers with 90% ownership of the firm.[6] A plan offered in November 2009 would allow shareholders of Bristol-Myers to exchange one dollar of stock in that company for $1.11 worth of shares in Mead Johnson for the 133.5 million shares in the firm, which would value the company at $7.7 billion based on the stock's then current closing price. The stock swap was intended to provide a tax-free exchange. CEO James M. Cornelius of Bristol-Myers said that "With a successful execution of this split-off, we fully consider ourselves a BioPharma company".[7]
Acquisition by Reckitt Benckiser[edit]
In February 2017 it was announced that Reckitt Benckiser was in advanced negotiations to acquire Mead Johnson.[8][9] On February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser Group announced it had agree to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.[10]
RB's intention was to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. In order to effect the transaction, RB incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition has merged, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the surviving entity at completion.[11]
Mead Johnson announced on June 12, 2017 that the final regulator approval to complete the acquisition had been received. On June 15, 2017 the merger was completed and Mead Johnson became the Infant and Child Nutrition (IFCN) Division of RB.

Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. Shares Are Surging On Today's News
The baby formula maker could be going the way of some its rivals and is in talks for a major buyout -- and that's welcome news for investors.

What happened
Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (NYSE:MJN), maker of infant formula such as Enfamil brand, is reportedly in talks of a $16.7 billion buyout from Reckitt Benckiser Group (NASDAQOTH:RBGLY). Shares are up nearly 25% as of 11 a.m. EST Thursday.
So what
U.K.'s Reckitt Benckiser is a consumer good conglomerate with products from Lysol to Air Wick air fresheners. The company has been looking for a play further into the pharmaceutical sector, but looks like this will be its big buy instead. Reckitt Benckiser is known for its shrewd cost management in these acquired companies, which helps boost value long term. The offer of $90 cash per share of Mead Johnson is about 30% higher than Wednesday's closing price, hence Thursday's Mead Johnson stock surge.
A few months ago, Chinese baby food maker Synutra was bought out as those investors believed in the growth of the baby formula market. The deal with Mead Johnson looks to be similar, especially in China where Mead Johnson gets about a third of its total sales. This deal would pit Reckitt Benckiser directly against industry behemoths Nestlé S.A. and Groupe Danone, two of the largest volume sellers of baby formula worldwide.





Now what
Mead Johnson investors should be thrilled with the news, after seeing the stock drop around 26% since July until Thursday morning's surge. The move by Reckitt Benckiser looks well timed as even $90 per share is below where Mead Johnson's stock was in July, making this look like a deal for what could be a resurgent brand.
The market moved fast to price the shares appropriately for the potential buyout, so there's little value left to be squeezed out of them assuming the deal goes through. However, there is still the chance for competing bids, which could push that price up higher before a final deal is signed.

Reckitt Benckiser to Buy Mead Johnson in $16.6 Billion Deal - Bloomberg

Reckitt Benckiser to Buy Mead Johnson in $16.6 Billion Deal
By Paul Jarvis

February 10, 2017, 9:51 AM EST







                Lysol maker seeks growth with baby formula as sales slow
            



                Reckitt Benckiser sees $250 million savings after three years
            



Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc agreed to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion, taking the U.K. consumer-products maker into the baby-formula market and providing a catalyst for growth as its sales momentum slows.The $90-a-share takeover will add to earnings within a year and lead to 200 million pounds ($250 million) of cost savings after three years, the maker of Lysol cleaners said Friday. Reckitt shares fell, reversing early gains, as the company forecast 2017 revenue gains below analyst estimates and said it had a “soft” start to the first quarter.Reckitt Benckiser’s biggest-ever takeover boosts growth prospects after 2016 revenue advanced at the slowest pace in more than five years amid tough conditions in Europe and emerging markets like Brazil. A $480 million breakup fee reduces the chance of a counter-offer for Mead Johnson, which has been touted as a takeover candidate since the maker of Enfamil went public in 2009.








“This deal has potential to reignite top-line growth, the only area where the Reckitt model appears lacking,” said Deborah Aitken, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Sales SlowdownThe acquisition marks an “inflection point” for Reckitt Benckiser, Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor said at a press conference. He cited urbanization, changes to China’s one-child policy and increasing rates of women entering the workforce as reasons for entering the infant nutrition market, which he sees growing at 3 percent to 5 percent a year in the medium term.Reckitt Benckiser shares fell 1.5 percent to 7,133 pence at 2:30 p.m. in London. Mead Johnson gained 4.8 percent to $87.04 in early New York trading. The offer price is the same as the companies indicated when they announced the negotiations on Feb. 1.




The bid values the target at 17 times earnings compared with multiples of 20 that Nestle paid for Pfizer’s baby-formula unit in 2012 and 22 that Danone paid for baby-food maker Numico in 2007, according to John Baumgartner, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The debt-funded acquisition will add to per-share earnings in the first full year and will be “double-digit accretive” by the third year, Reckitt Benckiser said.




“This looks just about achievable to us at first blush,” Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies, said of the cost-saving forecast.Adding Baby Food to Condoms Helps Reckitt Boss Forget Lousy YearThe announcement of the deal was accompanied by Reckitt Benckiser’s fourth-quarter results, which were brought forward from Monday and missed expectations. Like-for-like sales growth of 1 percent compared with a company-compiled consensus estimate of 1.7 percent. Full-year operating profit was in line with estimates at 28.1 percent of sales.The U.K. company also forecast 3 percent growth in like-for-like sales this year, below analyst estimates for a gain of about 4.2 percent. The first quarter has been weighed down by a new product in the Scholl foot-care line that failed to live up to expectations and will be a drag on performance through the first half of the year, Kapoor said.“In 2017, we expect macro conditions to remain challenging, and for a number of existing headwinds to persist in the first half,” the CEO said in a statement.Although not previously considered by analysts to be an obvious acquirer of Mead Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser has had the U.S. company on its radar for a number of years, Kapoor said Friday on a conference call.The purchase will add baby formula to a portfolio of consumer brands that include Nurofen painkillers, Strepsils throat lozenges and French’s mustard. Reckitt Benckiser has proven able to enter and thrive in new categories before, as it did when it acquired Durex condom maker SSL International Plc in 2010. And it already has a toe in the nutrition business from its 2012 purchase of Schiff Nutrition, which makes Omega-3 supplements and joint-pain pills.Asia AttractionsOne of the main reasons for the takeover is to increase Reckitt Benckiser’s presence in the developing markets of Asia. Mead Johnson trails Nestle and Danone in the global baby-nutrition business, though it’s second only to Nestle in Asia, the biggest market.Baby food will likely be one of Asia’s fastest-growing food categories, even as the industry contends with near-term headwinds, Bloomberg Intelligence noted in December.Reckitt Benckiser said it expects to complete the takeover by the end of the third quarter and expects to retain a “strong” investment-grade credit rating.Robey Warshaw and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as joint lead financial advisers to Reckitt Benckiser, which also received advice from Deutsche Bank and HSBC. Mead Johnson was advised by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.— With assistance by Thomas Buckley, John Ainger, and Sam Chambers

Choosing to Formula-Feed
 



      Share:    

 






There are many reasons a mother may decide formula feeding is the best option for providing her child with the basic nutrition requirements needed for proper growth and development. Here are some helpful tips to use when choosing formula for your baby.
 
Nine out of ten mothers use formula.
According to a recent study, most new mothers (9 out of 10, actually) use formula at some point during their baby's first year. So you're not alone, not by a long shot.
Women are choosing formula feeding for many reasons.
Either mom or baby has physical or medical issues.
She can't pump or breastfeed after returning to work.
She wants Dad and other family members to be a part of feeding.
There are many formula options for your baby.
You can feel good knowing that there are some excellent formula options out there. Look for the ones that are specially formulated to nourish your baby's brain and eye development and immune health.
What to look for in an infant formula:
Different brands of formulas have different levels of DHA, ARA and choline, key nutrients found in breast milk. Look for a formula with expert-recommended levels of these important building blocks for your baby's brain and eyes.
Most babies thrive on a formula with whole proteins. Breast milk has whole proteins in it, and you want your formula to be as close to breast milk as possible.
Your formula should satisfy your baby's basic nutrition requirements and provide the balanced nutrition your baby needs, including calcium and antioxidants.
Smart Formula Nutrition

*Average level of DHA in worldwide breast milk is 0.32% +/- 0.22% (mean +/- standard deviation of total fatty acids) based on an analysis of 65 studies of 2,474 women.
†As calculated from the mean choline content of human milk determined by the Institute of Medicine.

Mead Johnson Nutrition is a leading manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company dates back to a firm created by Edward Mead Johnson, one of the co-founders of Johnson & Johnson, who created his own business in 1895, which was renamed Mead Johnson & Company in 1905. The company was majority owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb after an acquisition in 1967, but was spun off in 2009 as an independent firm.
In the year end 31 December 2016, Mead Johnson reported net sales of $3,743 million. Fifty percent of those sales were generated in Asia, 17% in Latin America and 33% in North America/Europe. For the same time period, the company reported total assets of $4,088 million.
In February 2017, British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (RB) bid $16.7 billion for the company.[1]
On June 15, 2017 MJN announced that its merger with Reckitt Benckiser (RB) had been completed. As a result, MJN's common stock is no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange, effective the announcement date.[2]

History and products[edit]




Dextri-Maltose and Pablum, early Mead Johnson products


Edward Mead Johnson had founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886 together with his brothers. In 1895, Johnson developed a side business called The American Ferment Company to create a digestive aid. In 1897, E. Mead Johnson left the family business to go out into business on his own in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1905, the company was re-established as Mead Johnson & Company.[3] The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be clinically approved and recommended by doctors. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.[3]
Edward Mead Johnson died in 1934, and Lambert Mead Johnson succeeded his father as president, and served in the position until 1955, making him the longest-serving president in company history.[3] D. Mead Johnson was the third generation of the family to serve as chief executive of the firm. During his tenure, which lasted from 1955 until the firm's takeover by Bristol-Myers in 1968, the firm's annual sales tripled to $131 million, and grew to nearly 4,400 employees.[4]
Acquisition and spin-off from Bristol-Myers[edit]
Bristol-Myers reached agreement in August 1967 for a deal under which Mead Johnson would be acquired, with shareholders receiving a mix of common and preferred stock in a deal valued at $240 million. Mead Johnson's net sales in 1966 were $131 million with earnings of $7.3 million.[5]
Bristol-Myers announced in February 2009 that it was going to spin off Mead Johnson to focus on its primary pharmaceutics business, with an initial public offering estimated to bring in $562.5 million and would leave Bristol-Myers with 90% ownership of the firm.[6] A plan offered in November 2009 would allow shareholders of Bristol-Myers to exchange one dollar of stock in that company for $1.11 worth of shares in Mead Johnson for the 133.5 million shares in the firm, which would value the company at $7.7 billion based on the stock's then current closing price. The stock swap was intended to provide a tax-free exchange. CEO James M. Cornelius of Bristol-Myers said that "With a successful execution of this split-off, we fully consider ourselves a BioPharma company".[7]
Acquisition by Reckitt Benckiser[edit]
In February 2017 it was announced that Reckitt Benckiser was in advanced negotiations to acquire Mead Johnson.[8][9] On February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser Group announced it had agree to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.[10]
RB's intention was to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. In order to effect the transaction, RB incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition has merged, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the surviving entity at completion.[11]
Mead Johnson announced on June 12, 2017 that the final regulator approval to complete the acquisition had been received. On June 15, 2017 the merger was completed and Mead Johnson became the Infant and Child Nutrition (IFCN) Division of RB.

Edward Mead Johnson had founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886 together with his brothers. In 1895, Johnson developed a side business called The American Ferment Company to create a digestive aid. In 1897, E. Mead Johnson left the family business to go out into business on his own in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1905, the company was re-established as Mead Johnson & Company.[3] The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be clinically approved and recommended by doctors. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.[3]
Edward Mead Johnson died in 1934, and Lambert Mead Johnson succeeded his father as president, and served in the position until 1955, making him the longest-serving president in company history.[3] D. Mead Johnson was the third generation of the family to serve as chief executive of the firm. During his tenure, which lasted from 1955 until the firm's takeover by Bristol-Myers in 1968, the firm's annual sales tripled to $131 million, and grew to nearly 4,400 employees.[4]
Acquisition and spin-off from Bristol-Myers[edit]
Bristol-Myers reached agreement in August 1967 for a deal under which Mead Johnson would be acquired, with shareholders receiving a mix of common and preferred stock in a deal valued at $240 million. Mead Johnson's net sales in 1966 were $131 million with earnings of $7.3 million.[5]
Bristol-Myers announced in February 2009 that it was going to spin off Mead Johnson to focus on its primary pharmaceutics business, with an initial public offering estimated to bring in $562.5 million and would leave Bristol-Myers with 90% ownership of the firm.[6] A plan offered in November 2009 would allow shareholders of Bristol-Myers to exchange one dollar of stock in that company for $1.11 worth of shares in Mead Johnson for the 133.5 million shares in the firm, which would value the company at $7.7 billion based on the stock's then current closing price. The stock swap was intended to provide a tax-free exchange. CEO James M. Cornelius of Bristol-Myers said that "With a successful execution of this split-off, we fully consider ourselves a BioPharma company".[7]
Acquisition by Reckitt Benckiser[edit]
In February 2017 it was announced that Reckitt Benckiser was in advanced negotiations to acquire Mead Johnson.[8][9] On February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser Group announced it had agree to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.[10]
RB's intention was to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. In order to effect the transaction, RB incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition has merged, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the surviving entity at completion.[11]
Mead Johnson announced on June 12, 2017 that the final regulator approval to complete the acquisition had been received. On June 15, 2017 the merger was completed and Mead Johnson became the Infant and Child Nutrition (IFCN) Division of RB.

Mead Johnson Nutrition is a leading manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company dates back to a firm created by Edward Mead Johnson, one of the co-founders of Johnson & Johnson, who created his own business in 1895, which was renamed Mead Johnson & Company in 1905. The company was majority owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb after an acquisition in 1967, but was spun off in 2009 as an independent firm.
In the year end 31 December 2016, Mead Johnson reported net sales of $3,743 million. Fifty percent of those sales were generated in Asia, 17% in Latin America and 33% in North America/Europe. For the same time period, the company reported total assets of $4,088 million.
In February 2017, British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (RB) bid $16.7 billion for the company.[1]
On June 15, 2017 MJN announced that its merger with Reckitt Benckiser (RB) had been completed. As a result, MJN's common stock is no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange, effective the announcement date.[2]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
