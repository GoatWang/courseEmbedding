In 2000, Sweetnam was named vice president of operations, heavy-duty transmission clutch and aftermarket, truck. From 2001 to 2008, he served as senior vice president and president, truck group.
Prior to joining Eaton, Sweetnam spent 10 years at Cummins Engine Co., where he served in a variety of significant roles, including president of Cummins Electronics Co. and group managing director of Holset Engineering Co. Ltd., Cummins’ U.K.-based global turbocharger business. From 1977 to 1985, Sweetnam served in a variety of managerial roles for Canadian Liquid Air Ltd. in Montreal, Quebec, and Calgary, Alberta. From 1975 to 1977, he served as a construction engineer and product and operations engineer with Air Products & Chemicals in Allentown, Pa., and Sao Paulo, Brazil. He began his career as a civil engineer at Olko Engineering in New York, N.Y.
Sweetnam earned a bachelor’s degree in applied science and engineering from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a master’s degree from Harvard University. He is a board member of The Lubrizol Corp., a specialty chemical company based in Wickliffe, Ohio, and the board of trustees for ideastream, a public service multimedia organization based in Cleveland.
