The effect of product diversification strategies on the relationship between international diversification and firm performance

            Chang, Shao-Chi; Wang, Chi-Feng
        

            Previous studies have provided mixed evidence on the interaction effect of product and international diversification on firm performance. This study extends this stream of research by investigating the differential impacts of product diversification strategies on the relationship between international diversification and firm performance. We find that while related product diversification positively influences the performance of multinational firms, unrelated product diversification negatively moderates the international diversification–performance relationship. The evidence is robust for different models of international diversification and firm performance, and holds for firms in both the service and manufacturing industries. Our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing different product diversification strategies, and provide a potential explanation for prior mixed evidence.

The effect of product diversiﬁcation strategies on the relationshipbetween international diversiﬁcation and ﬁrm performanceShao-Chi Changa,*, Chi-Feng Wanga,baInstitute of International Business, National Cheng Kung University, No. 1, University Road, 701 Tainan, TaiwanbDepartment of International Trade, Cheng Shiu University, TaiwanAbstractPrevious studies have provided mixed evidence on the interaction effect of product and international diversiﬁcation on ﬁrmperformance. This study extends this stream of research by investigating the differential impacts of product diversiﬁcation strategieson the relationship between international diversiﬁcation and ﬁrm performance. We ﬁnd that while related product diversiﬁcationpositively inﬂuences the performance of multinational ﬁrms, unrelated product diversiﬁcation negatively moderates the interna-tional diversiﬁcation–performance relationship. The evidence is robust for different models of international diversiﬁcation and ﬁrmperformance, and holds for ﬁrms in both the service and manufacturing industries. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance ofdistinguishing different product diversiﬁcation strategies, and provide a potential explanation for prior mixed evidence.# 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionAs an increasing number of ﬁrms expand into globalmarkets, the impact of international diversiﬁcation hasgenerated quite an interest among researchers (e.g.,Capar & Kotabe, 2003; Contractor, Kundu, & Hsu,2003; Gomes & Ramaswamy, 1999; Hitt, Hoskinsson,& Kim, 1997; Lu & Beamish, 2004). Since globaldiversiﬁcation encompasses dimensions of geographicas well as product markets (Kim, Hwang, & Burgers,1989), many multinational ﬁrms have also diversiﬁedtheir products. Prior literatures have argued that thestrategy of product diversiﬁcation has importantinﬂuences on the performance of multinational ﬁrms(Geringer, Beamish, & da Costa, 1989; Hitt et al., 1997;Kim et al., 1989). For example, the experience ofproduct diversiﬁcation enables managers to betterhandle the diversity and complexity created frominternational diversiﬁcation. Diversiﬁed ﬁrms mayreplicate the structures and capabilities established intheir existing operations to cross-border expansion inorder to reduce potential transaction costs. Furthermore,economies of scale and scope arising from theinterdependencies across divisions bring ﬁrms greateropportunities to achieve synergy of product diversity asthey expand into global markets.Nevertheless, the empirical evidence on the inter-action effect between product and international diver-siﬁcation has been mixed. Hitt et al. (1997) found thatproduct diversiﬁcation positively enhances the perfor-mance of internationally diversiﬁed ﬁrms. In contrast,Geringer, Tallman, and Olsen (2000) and Tallman andLi (1996) found no signiﬁcant evidence for aninteractive effect between international and productdiversiﬁcation. Furthermore, Kim et al. (1989) foundthat the effect of product diversiﬁcation is contingentupon the extent of international diversiﬁcation.

Technological outsourcing and product diversification: do markets for technology affect firms’ strategies?

            Cesaroni, Fabrizio
        

            This paper analyses how the existence of competitive technology markets affects firms’ technology sourcing decisions, and their propensity to enter into new product markets. While the division of innovative labour has received increasing attention within the economic literature, this paper focuses on its managerial implications. By means of a specialised database, we assess how patterns of technology trade influence firms’ technology and diversification strategies in the chemical industry. We find that, the larger the market for technology, the stronger the advantages to substitute internal R&D with outsourcing, and to increase the degree of product diversification.

Research Policy 33 (2004) 1547–1564Technological outsourcing and product diversiﬁcation:do markets for technology affect ﬁrms’ strategies?Fabrizio Cesaroni∗Laboratory of Economics and Management, St. Anna School of Advanced Studies, Piazza Martiri della Liberta 33,Pisa 56127, ItalyReceived 2 July 2003; received in revised form 27 July 2004; accepted 4 August 2004Available online 2 October 2004AbstractThis paper analyses how the existence of competitive technology markets affects ﬁrms’ technology sourcing decisions, andtheir propensity to enter into new product markets. While the division of innovative labour has received increasing attentionwithin the economic literature, this paper focuses on its managerial implications. By means of a specialised database, we assesshow patterns of technology trade inﬂuence ﬁrms’ technology and diversiﬁcation strategies in the chemical industry. We ﬁnd that,the larger the market for technology, the stronger the advantages to substitute internal R&D with outsourcing, and to increasethe degree of product diversiﬁcation.© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Keywords: Market for technology; Technological outsourcing; Technology transfer; Product diversiﬁcation; Chemical industry1. IntroductionThe present study focuses on the inﬂuence that tech-nology markets play on ﬁrms’ technological and di-versiﬁcation strategies. While the managerial literaturehas discussed the causes and motivations of diversiﬁ-cation and of technology outsourcing for a long time, ithas only recently discovered the importance of marketsfor technology and the inﬂuence that they play on cor-porate strategies (Arora et al., 2001; Gans and Stern,∗Tel.: +39 050 883345; fax: +39 050 883344.E-mail address: cesaroni@sssup.it.2003). These recent studies have mostly explored howthe possibility to commercialisetechnologies by meansof market-based transactions affects ﬁrms’ capabilitytogainproﬁtsfromtechnologydevelopment,andhencehave assessed the inﬂuence of technology markets onlyfrom the perspective of technology developers. Theyhave mostly explored the supply side of markets fortechnology.In this study we take the opposite perspective.

Turner Titan, L.P.




LARGE CAP
			Diversified Inception Date: 7.1.10



Portfolio Manager

				Christopher Baggini, CFA


	The Turner Titan, L.P. is a global, diversified portfolio of long and short investments across all major industry sectors with a focus on large cap companies.


Assets in strategy (As of 6.30.14): $55.3 million*
*Assets may include assets that are managed as LP, mutual fund or separately managed accounts

Investment Philosophy

	We seek to buy companies with improving earnings dynamics and short those with deteriorating fundamentals.

Investment Process

	The heart of Turner’s stock selection process is fundamental analysis. For long positions, our global security analysts seek to identify:


	Global companies benefiting from change:


Accelerating earnings;
		 
Improving expectations;
		 
High returns on capital.


	Industry leaders:


Strong management;
		 
Sustainable earnings, margins, and revenue growth;
		 
Compelling new products and services;
		 
Open-ended business opportunities;
		 
Market share gains.


	Our analysts seek to identify sale/short sale candidates by identifying companies that exhibit the following:




			stock prices that appear to already reflect earnings;
		



			expectations of adverse events that would affect long-term earnings;
		



			poorly performing management;
		



			indicators that the company is likely to fail to meet expected performance; or
		



			companies that exist in industries with structural weaknesses.
		



	Our Investment Team is aligned by investment strategies with a lead portfolio manager(s) and a dedicated team of sector analysts. Each investment strategy team also has access to a shared resource pool of analysts with a specific sector/industry expertise. Our analysts use innovative and multidisciplinary methods, allowing them to capture investment opportunities in all market cycles.


	Extensive, sector-focused analysis is undertaken by our sector experts to identify and quantify the critical factors driving growth. The goal of our sector teams is to produce 360°analysis utilizing input from financials, competitors, suppliers, customers and independent research providers to determine if the companies followed will exceed, meet, or fall short of consensus earnings expectations. In addition, members of our Investment Team conduct meetings with domestic and international companies' management in efforts to gain further insight into the dynamics behind a company’s growth prospects.


	The lead portfolio manager collaborates directly with the sector analysts regarding the output of their research, and is ultimately responsible for security selection and for the individual weighting of each portfolio holding.

Important Disclosure

Only persons that qualify as "accredited investors" for purposes of regulation D under the Securities Act, and as "qualified clients" for purposes of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, may invest in interest. The interests are offered in a manner to enable the partnership to be excluded from registration under the Investment Company Act. Nothing presented should be considered an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in or shares of any fund described herein. Any such offer or solicitation will be made only by means of the relevant offering document, which is available by calling Carolyn Patton at 484.329.2440. Please read the offering document carefully prior to making an investment. 

There are various substantial risks associated with an investment in the Fund including:

	• The Fund(s) may engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices including but not limited to short sales, option strategies, 
structured derivatives, commodity interests and swap agreements that may increase the risk of investment loss;
	• The investment risks of the Fund are increased by the Funds' ability to focus its investments in one or more economic sector, to invest in smaller and medium capitalization companies, foreign companies, and IPO’s; 
	• Investments in the Fund can be highly illiquid;
	• The Fund is not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors;
	• May involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information;
	• The Fund is not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds;
	• The Fund may also take advantage of opportunities in the area of options, futures contracts and options thereon and any other synthetic or derivative instruments which are not presently contemplated for use by the Fund or which are not currently available but which may be developed to the extent such opportunities are both consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and legally permissible for the Fund.

	You should consider purchasing Interests in any fund only if you are fully able, financially and otherwise, to bear a loss of your entire investment, and if you have the background and experience to understand thoroughly the risks of an investment in the Partnership. The offering document contains a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in the Fund and should be read carefully prior to considering making an investment. Each prospective investor is encouraged to obtain the advice of an accountant, attorney, tax consultant, and/or business adviser with respect to the legal, tax, and business aspects of an investment prior to subscribing for interests.

The YTD net return shown for a completed calendar year reflects actual fees and expenses paid; the YTD net return shown for a portion of a calendar year or for an individual month reflects estimated fees and expenses only. Actual fees and expenses may vary.

	The general partner reserves the right to pay any or all Fund fees and expenses in its sole discretion. An investor’s actual return may vary significantly from the returns shown.

	The views and opinions expressed are not intended as a forecast, a guarantee of future results, investment recommendations, or an offer to buy or sell any securities. Opinions about individual securities mentioned may change, and there can be no guarantee that the Fund will select and hold any particular security for its client portfolios.

NW Refining  is an Alberta- based company with a vision to create value-added products and services in high demand. Through its participation in the North West Redwater Partnership (NWR), NW Refining will build and operate the first new refinery to be built in Canada since 1984. The Sturgeon Refinery, located 45 kilometres east of Edmonton, will maximize the value of Alberta’s bitumen resources in a responsible and sustainable manner.  Once Phase One of the Sturgeon Refinery is complete, it will have the capacity to process approximately 79,000 barrels per day of bitumen blend feedstock into approximately 80,000 barrels per day of high value and high demand refined products including low carbon diesel and diluents. The Sturgeon Refinery is the first refinery to incorporate carbon capture from the outset and will utilize gasification technology to capture the CO2 produced during the refining process and sell it as feedstock to Enhance Energy Inc., whose Alberta Carbon Trunk Line will use this feedstock for enhanced oil recovery before safely and permanently storing the CO2 deep underground. Responsibly processing more bitumen in Alberta will create more jobs for Albertans, while managing our CO2footprint and creating products that can access world markets.

Ferus Natural Gas Fuels (Ferus NGF), privately held by The Energy & Minerals Group, builds and operates liquefied and compressed natural gas (LNG and CNG) fueling infrastructure across North America to promote and facilitate the use of natural gas as a more economic and cleaner-burning alternative fuel to diesel.
Ferus NGF built the first Canadian merchant LNG plant in Elmworth, AB, (highlighted in the Alberta Climate Leadership Discussion Paper) which is providing LNG fuel to oil and gas operations in the region, local utilities during natural gas service outages, and to Ferus’ own LNG-powered tractors - the only LNG-powered Class 8 Heavy Duty trucks operating in Alberta.
		In the United States, Ferus NGF LP has partnered with General Electric in a North Dakota CNG business, which captures natural gas that would otherwise be flared, compresses it, and uses the CNG to fuel drilling and fracturing operations in place of diesel (featured in the Alberta Climate Leadership Report to the Minister). Our Houston-based Eagle LNG division is building two LNG plants in Jacksonville, Florida – one to load LNG onto ocean-going vessels for export to countries currently using heavy fuel oil or diesel for power generation, and the second for use in domestic marine fueling.
By facilitating adoption of a lower carbon fuel, Ferus NGF is creating new markets for our abundant natural gas resource thereby contributing to energy diversification, and helping Alberta and Canada meet its climate change objectives.

Alberta is Canada’s largest petrochemical producing region and home to a $14 billion chemistry industry.
Alberta’s petrochemical industry is the province’s top manufacturing sector directly employing nearly 8,000 people, supporting key sectors of our economy and multiplying the value of our natural resources five to fifteen times.  This industry has seen significant growth since the 1970s when provincial government policy decisions encouraged the processing of natural gas and natural gas liquids signaling the beginning of this industry in Alberta. Creating the next generation of value added policy could add further world scale petrochemical plants, diversify our energy products and customers around the world, grow our provincial GDP by several billion dollars, increase economic stability and government revenues, and create thousands of permanent high paying, skilled jobs across Alberta for current and future generations of Albertans.








WHAT WE DO



Diversification encourages innovation and sustainability










ADDING VALUE WHILE 
   	    RESPECTING THE ENVIRONMENT


The Council is focused on:

Identifying and expanding existing opportunities in Alberta for companies that add value to energy resources.
Building the value added resource sector to provide stable jobs and a place for Alberta’s future workforce to grow and prosper.
Diversifying our slate of export products and capturing the potential for a greater share of world markets
Helping Alberta’s refined petroleum products access and compete successfully in global markets. 
Ensuring that Albertans receive the full value of their resources through strategic diversification and enhancement.
Identifying the barriers to investment and proposing mechanisms to seize the opportunities in manufacturing that are right for our province.
Promoting environmental stewardship and innovation.






THE POTENTIAL: Refining  Maximizing the Value of Our Resources




Decades after their discovery, the potential in our province’s bitumen reserves is still staggering today. From additional tax revenues to much needed jobs, the oil sands remain an enormous opportunity to ensure an even better Alberta for generations to come. Making the most of that opportunity will require significantly more refining here at home, where we can maximize the value of the resource by creating high-demand products such as diesel.  Responsibly processing more bitumen in Alberta will create more jobs for Albertans, while managing our environmental footprint and creating products that can access world markets.

RECYCLABLE PLASTICS WE ENJOY AND DEPEND ON


Alberta’s Value Added Industries
Alberta is blessed with an abundance of natural resources.
The production of those resources brings prosperity and benefits to Albertans. Adding value to our energy resources is the best way to capitalize on the development of Alberta's world scale feedstocks. Expanding and extending our product base from what we already do well, just makes good sense.  Value added manufacturing amplifies that prosperity and diversifies our economic base, at the same time often serving a valuable role in reducing emissions.  We can increase the worth of our resources, diversify our economy and manage our environmental footprint as we grow world class companies here in Alberta.






THE POTENTIAL: Responsible DevelopmentEnvironmental Stewardship of our Natural Resources




As we work to diversify our economy and add value to our natural resources, we are continually mindful of our environmental responsibilities.  We are committed to responsible development and are using new technologies to improve processes and outcomes.  We seek new ways to develop and upgrade our resources here in Alberta, further reducing our environmental footprint.  Innovation in the manufacturing sector has already led to emissions reduction, water conservation and a healthier environment.  Research and development of technology that is more efficient and produces environmental benefits is ongoing.  The responsible development and refining of Alberta’s resources is a commitment we all share to ensure a brighter future for all Albertans.
