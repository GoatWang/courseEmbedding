High Performance Greases
Request Information





HomeProductsGreases High Performance GreasesLess bearing failures, longer lasting greases
For strong bearing and bushing protection and optimal performance, you need grease capable of lasting longer in extreme conditions. You need Schaeffer’s grease.
Severe working conditions are no match for our versatile greases. Using advanced load carrying properties, Schaeffer’s greases prevent metal-to-metal contact during periods of tremendous pressure, increased heat and high shock loads. Even when exposed to moisture and containments, our greases retain their grease-like consistency. This unique staying power means less grease application while providing optimal bearing performance.

With a reputation for lasting two to three times longer than the competition, our greases simplify maintenance and reduce operating costs. See for yourself what others have experienced – components last longer with Schaeffer’s greases.




Reduce Friction and Wear
Our robust greases provide a durable shield against friction and wear. This enables moving parts to rotate smoothly and freely so your equipment can operate efficiently with less downtime.




Reduce Grease Consumption
Blended with advanced thickeners and base oils, our greases resist thinning out and separating as conditions intensify. Schaeffer’s greases stay with the bearings and keep them properly lubricated for extended periods of time.




Resist Washout
When exposed to water, Schaeffer’s greases resist emulsifying and washing away on components. Our rust inhibiting additives give our greases the strength they need to form a seal against water and shield surfaces from rust and corrosion.




Strong Load Carrying Capabilities
Fortified with moly and anti-wear additives, Schaeffer’s greases withstand tremendous loads up to 500,000 psi. Significantly less friction occurs in components, resulting in less wear and cooler area temperatures – which ultimately leads to longer equipment life.

To access the decision makers in that market we also needed to develop a new channel of large systems integrators.  Within 6 months we built relationships with EDS, CSC, and Northrop Grummon systems integration units and sold multi-million dollar deals to customers including the Homeland Security Department, Sears, and EDS Corporate.Executive AffiliateRHK, IncMay 2002  –  May 2003 (1 year 1 month)was a $25 million firm providing strategic consulting services and market research information & analysis to top executives of leading telecommunications services and equipment suppliers.Executive AffiliateEngaged by RHK to help extend their consulting practice in the service provider domain and to reposition the practice to higher-level executive relationships with client companies.CEOQuantumShift CorporationJanuary 2000  –  January 2002 (2 years 1 month)$32M start-up providing a hosted telecom management software application and a full suite of voice and data services to mid-sized companies throughout the United States.President and CEORecruited to lead this start-up venture backed company at the height of the technology boom.

Home  Faculty and Research
		        
Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.
