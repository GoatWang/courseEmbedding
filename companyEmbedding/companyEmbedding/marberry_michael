Marberry was integral in developing Huber’s corporate and business unit strategies, completed numerous acquisitions and divestitures, implemented the Corporation’s debt capital structure, and strengthened Huber’s internal controls and compliance program.

Marberry was a business strategy consultant at McKinsey & Company for four years. Prior to this, he was a process engineer and product development group leader at the Procter & Gamble Company for five years.

Michael L. Marberry


Michael Marberry is known for new ideas, strategic initiatives and a  vision  of the future – and he has demonstrated those abilities on an  international  scale.
A native of Paducah, he earned a Bachelor of   Science degree in chemical engineering from the University of Kentucky   in 1981, graduating with high distinction. Throughout his career, he has  taken  on positions of increasing responsibility. His strategies will  shape the future  of J.M. Huber Corporation, where he now serves as  President and CEO.
He made the most of opportunities at UK, completing  engineering  internships with Union Carbide Corporation and Exxon  Research and Development  laboratories. He received graduate fellowship  awards from Ashland Oil and  Phillips Petroleum, and returned to UK to  earn a Master’s Degree in  chemical engineering in 1983.
From there, his rise to leadership accelerated. He  joined the Procter &  Gamble Company in Cincinnati  in 1983 as a  product development engineer. In his first two years there, he led  the  product formulation and process design for a unique new product – Crest   Tartar Control toothpaste. He was co-inventor on a patent awarded to  P&G  for innovation in that area. He led the production startup to  commercialize  Crest Tartar Control at Procter & Gamble’s U.S.-based  manufacturing plants.
He was promoted in 1986 to product development group  leader, a position in  which he directly supervised a team of research  and development engineers. He  led projects coordinating the purchasing,  manufacturing, marketing, sales and  distribution of new Crest  products.
He then decided to pursue further education in the  area of general  management. Mr. Marberry left P&G in 1988 to enroll  in the Amos Tuck School  of Business Administration at Dartmouth    College, and earned his  Master of Business Administration degree in  1990, graduating with honors as an  Edward Tuck Scholar.
His next step allowed his problem-solving and  leadership skills to benefit  many companies. He joined McKinsey and  Company, one of the world’s leading  consulting firms.
There he was involved with a wide range of projects  covering many  industries, as well as government. He led a comprehensive  corporate redesign  program that enabled a $2 billion public utility to  compete more effectively  following deregulation.
He provided analysis and recommendations to the  Minister of Finance in a  Latin American country to support trade  negotiations with Mexico. A  leading personal computer company benefited  from a process he designed to  evaluate and commercialize new  technologies. He also implemented a new sales,  marketing and  distribution strategy to expand the company’s North American  market  share; and he designed and validated a more effective performance   measurement and management control system.
His ability to work with a variety of corporate  leaders in developing key  business strategies is a testament to his  skills in building and maintaining  strong relationships.
In 1994 Mr. Marberry was named Director of Corporate  Strategy and  Development for M.A. Hanna Corporation, a publicly traded  $2 billion specialty  polymer business headquartered in Cleveland.  He  chaired the company’s strategic review committee, managed international   expansion projects, and led numerous merger and acquisition  initiatives. His  leadership and negotiation skills were again in  evidence as he completed  important acquisitions in Germany,  the United  Kingdom, Denmark, Norway,  and Singapore, and  established the  company’s first operating joint venture in China.
He found his next challenge in 1997 with J.M. Huber,  a private, multi-billion  dollar conglomerate with more than 4,000  employees in 28 countries. Huber has  diverse operations in specialty  chemicals, oil and gas exploration, timber and  wood products and  financial services. As vice president for new business  development, Mr.  Marberry held direct responsibility for corporate portfolio   management, technology transfer and merger and acquisition transactions.  He led  the planning and negotiation as Huber acquired Noviant, one of  the world’s  leading manufacturers of cellulose ethers, and served as  managing director of  Noviant for 18 months to oversee the transition.
As Huber’s chief financial officer, he led a global  finance organization  with more than 100 professionals. He served as a  board member for most Huber  subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2004, he  led negotiations for Huber’s largest  mergers and acquisitions  transaction ever, the $1 billion acquisition of CP  Kelco, a leading  producer of specialty hydrocolloids with a wide variety of   applications.
In 2006, Mr. Marberry was named President of Huber  Engineered Materials.  Huber Engineered Materials was formed in 1998 by  combining J.M. Huber  Corporation’s Engineered Minerals Division and  Chemicals Division. He held this  role for three years and led the  company’s entry into China with the construction of a world-class   facility in Qingdao  for the production of precipitated silica.    Finally, in June 2009, Mr. Marberry was named the new President and CEO   of J.M. Huber Corporation, following the retirement of the former chief   executive.
Mr. Marberry is involved with numerous charities  including Feed the  Children, the United Way  and Monmouth Conservation  Foundation.
He and his wife Bernice reside in Holmdel,   New  Jersey. They have five  children: Felicia, Matthew, Sophia, Lauren, and  Brandon.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
