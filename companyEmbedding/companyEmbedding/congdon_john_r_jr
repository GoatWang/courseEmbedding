John Rhodes “Jack” Congdon Sr.founded Old Dominion Truck Leasing.









































































































During the late 1960s and ’70s, expansion was the name of the game in the trucking industry.“If you don’t go out and buy somebody, you will have a slow death,” opined John Rhodes “Jack” Congdon Sr. in a 1969 Richmond News Leader interview, when he was executive vice president of Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. and president of Old Dominion Truck Leasing and Continental Truck Leasing Co.Mr. Congdon, a trailblazer in the trucking industry and especially in truck leasing, was laid to rest last week in a private graveside service in Westhampton Memorial Park in Henrico County. The Richmond native and resident died of cancer Oct. 30 in Richmond. He was 80.In 1934, his parents, Lillian and Earl Congdon, traded in a car someone gave them as a wedding gift on a truck and used it to start Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., a Richmond-based business that did trucking runs to Norfolk.Jack Congdon drove Old Dominion trucks during summers before he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School. His mother became president and later chairwoman of Old Dominion after his father died. His brother, Earl Congdon Jr., eventually served as president, CEO and chairman.After serving as an Army military policeman for two years in Texas, he returned in 1955 to join his mother and brother at Old Dominion, where he rose to positions including senior vice president and vice chairman.In 1959 Old Dominion was a small intrastate hauler going between Richmond and Norfolk and doing little more than $1 million worth of business a year. Acquisition of a truck business with access to the major trucking routes in the Carolinas started the company into rapid expansion.In 1963, Jack Congdon founded Old Dominion Truck Leasing when a North Carolina customer who made school bus bodies asked if Old Dominion Freight Line could lease equipment to haul some of the bodies to a plant in Canada.He started with four pieces of equipment and no revenue. Six years later, he had 200 pieces of equipment and annual volume of about $1.5 million.Mr. Congdon served as director of the Chicago-based National Truck Leasing System.Mr. Congdon was a master Mason in Tuckahoe Masonic Lodge 347, AF&AM; a noble of Acca Temple Shrine; and a member and former deacon at River Road Church, Baptist.He was a supporter of VCU Medical Center’s Massey Cancer Center and Pauley Heart Center.A man who enjoyed the water, he loved spending time with his family at a river home he owned in White Stone.He was the widower of Natalie Neblett Congdon, to whom he was married 58 years.Survivors include a daughter, Susan Terry; two sons, John R. Congdon Jr. and Jeff Congdon; a brother, Earl Everett Congdon Jr. of High Point, N.C.; and eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.erobertson@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6115

Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.


                  Old Dominion Customers, a lot of people think OD is in the business of shipping freight. Managing truck logistics. Moving cargo. And making deliveries.

What we’re really in the business of doing is keeping promises.

People keep promises, and that’s what everyone who works at Old Dominion does. Because even though it may look like a truck or a drayage container or maybe just a bunch of cardboard boxes, each one contains promises.

A promise that manufacturers will get what they need to produce their product. A promise that retailers will receive the product by a certain date and have it on the shelves. And ultimately, it’s a promise that consumers will be able to buy that product easily, whenever they need it.

At OD, we believe the world runs on promises, and no transportation company is better suited or skilled to keep those promises than we are.

The way we keep promises is by continually finding innovative ways to simplify your transportation process. Our four product groups, OD • Domestic, OD • Expedited, OD • Global and OD • Technology, provide you with all the products and services you need to make the promise of seamless simplicity a reality.

OD promises you the power of one source to meet your needs. We are not operating groups or business entities trying to act as one company. We ARE one company.

Our single company structure also allows us to excel on all levels of customer service and ensures that our thousands of employees share the same dedication to you, our customer, each and every day

2013 NEWS & PRESS RELEASES




Old Dominion Announces Passing of Jack Congdon
THOMASVILLE, N.C. (Nov. 1, 2013)  – John R. “Jack” Congdon, Sr., pioneer in truck leasing and longtime member of the Board of Directors at Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., has died following a battle with cancer. He was 80 years old.
Jack Congdon joined Old Dominion in 1951, and has held numerous positions within the company, up to and including Senior Vice President and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Jack Congdon is also the founder of Old Dominion Truck Leasing, a Virginia based corporation primarily engaged in the full-service leasing of tractors, trailers and other equipment.
“Jack Congdon is rightly considered a trailblazer within the trucking industry. In addition to founding Old Dominion Truck Leasing, he played an integral role in ensuring the success of Old Dominion Freight Line,” said David Congdon, Old Dominion’s president and CEO and Jack Congdon’s nephew. “A multitude of friends, family and colleagues at both companies mourn his loss.”
After serving in the U.S. Army as a military policeman, Jack Congdon returned to join his mother and older brother, Earl Congdon Jr., to build the family business, Old Dominion Freight Line. Jack participated in growing the company through a number of geographic expansions and acquisitions with his extensive knowledge of equipment management and dedicated logistics.
He is preceded in death by Natalie Neblett Congdon, his wife of 58 years and survived by their three children, Susan Terry, John Congdon Jr. and Jeff Congdon. He is also survived by his older brother, Earl Congdon, in addition to eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
