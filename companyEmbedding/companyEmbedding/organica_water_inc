Diverse biology improves treatment efficiency
Organica wastewater plants enhance the natural processes of complex ecosystems by utilizing considerably more diverse biology than those already in use in the industry.
In addition to the bacteria found in traditional activated sludge systems, Organica treatment plants are populated by over 3,000 species of microbes, aquatic flora and fauna.







Iconic structures in the middle of cities
We are proud to have been a trendsetter allowing treatment plants to be placed in the middle of urban and suburban population centers.
Our signature facilities bring the natural world into these environments, creating aesthetically appealing new spaces and enhancing quality of life for residents.







Cost Savings lead to Lower Treatment Costs
Organica-powered WWTPs result in CAPEX savings and more than 30% lower OPEX relative to conventional technology.
Even more importantly, the unique look & feel allows our wastewater treatment plants to be strategically located virtually anywhere. This results in lower infrastructure costs (typically 90%+ of total treatment cost), increased land value (often 2-4x the total CAPEX of a facility), and enablement of cost-effective reuse of the treated effluent.

Organica Water is a global provider of innovative solutions for the treatment and recycling of wastewater. Over the past two decades Organica has developed a truly unique approach, enabling customers all over the world to address urban water challenges in a cost and resource efficient manner. Organica’s solutions are all founded on the fundamental belief that nature provides the most efficient means to treat wastewater, offering significant cost savings compared to other solutions, and harmonious integration into modern urban lifestyles.Early daysEstablished in 1998, Organica began as a traditional wastewater design-build company focused exclusively on the Hungarian market. During the first nine years of its life the company built over 75 municipal, commercial, and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), using a variety of different technologies, for clients ranging from large municipalities to multinational companies such as GM, Audi, Alcoa, Shell, Suzuki and GE. At the same time, Organica invested significantly into R&D with a goal of developing its own IFAS-type (Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge) solution for biological wastewater treatment. In 2007 Organica sold its design-build business to focus exclusively on the commercialization of its own biological wastewater treatment solution on a global basis.International roll-outToday, Organica is an international company operating on three different continents, and the world leader in Fixed-Bed Biofilm Activated Sludge (FBAS) technology, with dozens of operating references in France, Hungary, and China. Organica’s dedicated team focuses on providing customers with sales support, WWTP design, and technology specific products, all of which enable them to build Organica-powered WWTPs for a variety of applications. Organica’s staff integrates a wide range of expertise and disciplines, with microbiologists, engineers, architects, economists, and sales professionals, all working towards the common goal of treating wastewater in less physical space and using less energy, resulting in significantly lower capital and operating costs compared to traditional approaches.

At the heart of the Organica Food Chain Reactor (FCR) solution is the Organica Biomodule. Designed to fit securely into the biological reactors, each Biomodule acts as the support structure for both the plants whose roots make up the primary biofilm carrier, and Organica’s specially developed proprietary biofiber media designed to mimic the structure and function of the plant roots.

The Biomodule includes plant racks, the biofiber media, fastening/adjustment mechanisms, and other materials including even the plants themselves.  The Biomodule is installed into the reactors to support and promote the growth of a healthy and robust fixed film culture of bacteria and other higher organisms on both the plant roots and biofiber media.





                        Installation of Organica Biomodule
                    


The root structures in turn provide an ideal habitat for a thriving ecosystem – both larger (3-4x greater active biomass per cubic meter of reactor volume) and more diverse (4x greater species diversity) than the biology found in typical conventional activated sludge based systems.
This results in the development of a distinctive self-regulating ecosystem with operational flexibility and high resilience to unexpected influent fluctuations and shock-loading.  In addition, because the Biomodules support this unique biofilm fixed on the root structures, the process utilizes much lower suspended solids content in the water (typically 90% less than conventional suspended growth systems).  This lower suspended solids content improves oxygen transfer efficiency and results in 30% or greater energy savings.
The Biomodule is the key component of an Organica FCR WWTP, enabling the same level of contaminant/nutrient removal in half (or less) reactor volume when compared to other activated sludge-based solutions.  This volume reduction results in land, construction, and equipment cost savings.

Designed specifically to remove the remaining Total Suspended Solids (TSS) content of the wastewater after biological treatment. Because the biomass in an Organica Food Chain Reactor (FCR) is primarily fixed on the root structures, suspended solids (TSS) content of the water at the end of biological treatment is significantly (commonly 90%) lower than conventional suspended growth systems (100-300 mg/l).  As a result, an Organica FCR WWTP can perform phase separation via discfilter units instead of space-consuming sedimentation tanks (secondary clarifiers).  Each Scallop discfilter incorporates a simple, yet sophisticated, design that ensures continuous and low-maintenance operation.

Organica’s Scallop discfilter is a mechanical cloth filtration device specially designed to remove suspended solids.  Designed as an “inside-out” system, water flows into the Scallop discfilter feed pipe and through openings into the discs mounted on the feed pipe. As the influent flows through the filter panels, suspended solids collect on the filtration media surface. The solids accumulate and generate headloss, which causes the feed pipe water level to rise until hitting a set point, triggering the automated backwash cycle. During backwash, the accumulated solids are washed from the rotating discs into the sludge trough by a small portion of the filtered water under pressure. Filtration is continuous even during backwash, and the design of the discfilter enables water to gravity flow through the whole system, minimizing pumping energy.
The design also allows for simple and easy access to individual filter panels for easy maintenance or replacement.

Farm-To-Fork
Fresh Garbanzo Bean Hummus
The flavor of this hummus is similar in flavor to hummus made with canned garbanzo beans (or chickpeas), only fresher. If you don't have fresh garbanzo beans, you can sub with canned ones, just drain and rinse first. 



RECIPE











WHAT'S SPROUTING
Summer's Bounty
"The canal is running as fast and full as it is able to. The rain water from last winter is sitting, flowing out of the reservoir, down the creek, into the canals, and ultimately to the thirsty farms that are filled with this season’s crops." Read more of Thaddeus' Farm News.

Recipe Roundup
Veggie Chips
Our members are always asking for suggestions on how to sneak some extra veggies into their families’ diets. Well, you've asked for it and here it is! We love serving these homemade veggie chips with fresh hummus, guacamole, or a yogurt dip.
