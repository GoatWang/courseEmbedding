Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
