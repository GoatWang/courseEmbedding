Enviva Partners, LP Receives Offer to Acquire Sampson Production Plant






October 17, 2016 04:36 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) (the “Partnership” or “we”) today 
      announced that Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC (the “Hancock JV”), a 
      joint venture between an affiliate of Enviva Holdings, LP and affiliates 
      of John Hancock Life Insurance Company, has offered to sell the entity 
      which owns the wood pellet production plant in Sampson County, North 
      Carolina (the “Sampson plant”), along with a 10-year, 420,000 metric ton 
      per year (“MTPY”) off-take contract with an affiliate of DONG Energy, to 
      the Partnership. The transaction also includes a 15-year, 95,000 MTPY 
      off-take contract with the Hancock JV and a third-party shipping 
      contract. As previously announced, the board of directors of the 
      Partnership’s general partner has formed a Conflicts Committee comprised 
      solely of independent directors to evaluate the offer. The final 
      purchase price and other terms are subject to negotiation with, and 
      approval of, the Conflicts Committee, but the Partnership currently 
      expects the final purchase price to be between $170 million and $180 
      million. Assuming terms of the acquisition are agreed upon, the 
      Partnership expects the transaction to close on or about January 3, 2017.
    

      Construction of the Sampson plant is complete and the plant is producing 
      wood pellets for sale. The Sampson plant is expected to produce 
      approximately 500,000 MTPY of wood pellets in 2017 and to reach its full 
      production capacity of approximately 600,000 MTPY in 2019. The Sampson 
      plant is expected to generate incremental Adjusted EBITDA of 
      approximately $22 million for 2017, increasing to approximately $27 
      million once full production capacity is achieved. Assuming completion 
      of the drop-down acquisition, the weighted average remaining term of the 
      Partnership’s off-take contracts would extend to 9.7 years and our 
      contracted revenue backlog would increase to $5.7 billion as of January 
      1, 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


Adjusted EBITDA


      We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation 
      and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement 
      of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset 
      impairments and disposals, and certain other items of income or loss 
      that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and 
      other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial 
      banks, and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our 
      assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.
    

      Our estimates of incremental adjusted EBITDA from the Sampson plant are 
      based on numerous assumptions that are subject to significant risks and 
      uncertainties. The assumptions underlying such estimates are inherently 
      uncertain and subject to significant business, economic, financial, 
      regulatory, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause 
      actual results and amounts to differ materially from those estimates. 
      For more information about such significant risks and uncertainties, 
      please see the risk factors discussed or referenced in our filings with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including the Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently 
      filed with the SEC. A reconciliation of estimated incremental adjusted 
      EBITDA to GAAP net income is not provided because forward-looking GAAP 
      net income generated by the Sampson plant is not accessible and 
      reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort. 
      The amount of interest expense with respect to the Sampson plant is not 
      accessible or estimable at this time. The amount of actual interest 
      expense incurred could be significant, such that the actual amount of 
      net income generated by the Sampson plant could vary substantially from 
      the respective amount of estimated incremental adjusted EBITDA.
    

Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements and information in this press release, including 
      those concerning our future results of operations, acquisition 
      opportunities, and distributions, may constitute “forward-looking 
      statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” 
      “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which 
      are generally not historical in nature. These forward-looking statements 
      are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and beliefs 
      concerning future developments and their potential effect on the 
      Partnership. Although management believes that these forward-looking 
      statements are reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that 
      future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it 
      anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks 
      and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control) 
      and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from the Partnership’s historical experience and its present 
      expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, 
      but are not limited to: (i) the amount of products that the Partnership 
      is able to produce, which could be adversely affected by, among other 
      things, operating difficulties; (ii) the volume of products that the 
      Partnership is able to sell; (iii) the price at which the Partnership is 
      able to sell products; (iv) changes in the price and availability of 
      natural gas, coal, or other sources of energy; (v) changes in prevailing 
      economic conditions; (vi) the Partnership’s ability to complete 
      acquisitions, including acquisitions from its sponsor; (vii) our ability 
      to successfully negotiate and complete the acquisition of the Sampson 
      plant and associated contracts (the “Sampson Acquisition”), integrate 
      the Sampson plant into our existing operations, and realize the 
      anticipated benefits of the Sampson Acquisition; (viii) unanticipated 
      ground, grade, or water conditions; (ix) inclement or hazardous weather 
      conditions, including extreme precipitation, temperatures, and flooding; 
      (x) environmental hazards; (xi) fires, explosions, or other accidents; 
      (xii) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations (or the 
      interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low-carbon energy, the 
      forestry products industry, or power generators; (xiii) inability to 
      acquire or maintain necessary permits; (xiv) inability to obtain 
      necessary production equipment or replacement parts; (xv) technical 
      difficulties or failures; (xvi) labor disputes; (xvii) late delivery of 
      raw materials; (xviii) inability of the Partnership’s customers to take 
      delivery or their rejection of delivery of products; (xix) failure of 
      the Partnership’s customers to pay or perform their contractual 
      obligations to the Partnership; (xx) changes in the price and 
      availability of transportation; and (xxi) the Partnership’s ability to 
      borrow funds and access capital markets.
    

      For additional information regarding known material factors that could 
      cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results, 
      please read its filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently filed 
      with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The 
      Partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Enviva Partners, LP, together with its subsidiaries ("we," "us," "our," or "the Partnership"), is a Delaware limited partnership formed on November 12, 2013. Our sponsor is Enviva Holdings, LP (and, where applicable, its wholly owned subsidiary Enviva Development Holdings, LLC) and references to our General Partner refer to Enviva Partners GP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of our sponsor. References to the "Hancock JV" refer to Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC, a joint venture between our sponsor, Hancock Natural Resource Group, Inc. and certain other affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis in Part II-Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Form 10-K"), as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Our 2016 Form 10-K contains a discussion of other matters not included herein, such as disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates and contractual obligations. You should also read the following discussion and analysis together with the risk factors set forth in the 2016 Form 10-K and the factors described under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Basis of Presentation  The following discussion of our historical performance and financial condition is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.  On December 14, 2016, the Hancock JV contributed to Enviva, LP all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests in Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC ("Sampson") for total consideration of $175.0 million. Sampson owns a wood pellet production plant in Sampson County, North Carolina (the "Sampson plant"). The acquisition (the "Sampson Drop-Down") also included two off-take contracts and related third-party shipping contracts.  Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for periods prior to December 14, 2016 have been retroactively recast to reflect the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down as if it occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson was originally organized. Entities contributed by or distributed to our sponsor or the Hancock JV are considered entities under common control and are recorded at historical cost with any excess consideration over cost being recorded as a distribution in partners' capital.  Business Overview  We are the world's largest supplier by production capacity of utility-grade wood pellets to major power generators. We own and operate six industrial-scale production plants in the Southeastern United States that have a combined wood pellet production capacity of 2.8 million metric tons per year ("MTPY"). We also own a deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake. All of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics. Owning these cost-advantaged assets, the output from which is fully contracted, in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows that should enable us to increase our per-unit cash distributions over time, which is our primary business objective.  Our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the Partnership. During 2017, contracted volumes under our existing off-take contracts are approximately equal to the full production capacity of our production plants. Our off-take contracts provide for sales of 2.7 million metric tons ("MT") of wood pellets in 2017 and have a weighted-average remaining term of 9.8 years from April 1, 2017. We intend to continue expanding our business by taking advantage of the growing demand for  Table of Contents  our product that is driven by the conversion of coal-fired power generation and combined heat and power plants to co-fired or dedicated biomass-fired plants, principally in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe and, increasingly, in South Korea and Japan.  How We Evaluate Our Operations  Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton  We use adjusted gross margin per metric ton to measure our financial performance. We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.  Adjusted EBITDA  We view adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of our financial performance. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.  Distributable Cash Flow  We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.  Table of Contents  The following tables present a reconciliation of each of adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Recast) (in thousands, except per metric ton) Reconciliation of gross margin to adjusted gross margin per metric ton: Metric tons sold 623 560 Gross margin $ 18,476 $ 15,755 Depreciation and amortization 8,432 6,881 Adjusted gross margin $ 26,908 $ 22,636  Adjusted gross margin per metric ton $ 43.19 $ 40.42   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Recast) (in thousands) Reconciliation of distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net income: Net income $ 2,502 $ 5,546 Add: Depreciation and amortization 8,436 6,893 Interest expense 7,705 3,391 Non-cash unit compensation expense 1,714 681 Asset impairments and disposals 24 1 Transaction expenses 2,533 53 Adjusted EBITDA 22,914 16,565 Less: Interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discounts 7,324 2,945 Maintenance capital expenditures 452 725 Distributable cash flow attributable to Enviva Partners, LP 15,138 12,895 Less: Distributable cash flow attributable to incentive distribution rights 537 156 Distributable cash flow attributable to Enviva Partners, LP limited partners $ 14,601 $ 12,739  Factors Impacting Comparability of Our Financial Results  Our future results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to our historical consolidated results of operations and cash flows, principally for the following reasons:  Our sponsor contributed its interest in Sampson to us on December 14, 2016. Our historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been retroactively recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Sampson as if the contributions had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson was originally organized. The recast amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily include general and administrative expenses associated with plant development and  Table of Contents  commissioning costs incurred during the construction of the Sampson plant. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the plant began producing wood pellets during the fourth quarter of 2016.  We began deliveries under a new long-term, firm off-take contract in December 2016. In connection with the Sampson Drop-Down, the Hancock JV assigned us a ten-year take-or-pay off-take contract with DONG Energy Thermal Power A/S (the "DONG Contract"). The contract commenced September 1, 2016 and provides for sales of 360,000 MTPY for the first delivery year and 420,000 MTPY for years two through ten. The contract, accompanied by our increased production capacity from the Sampson plant, will have a material effect on our product sales and resulting gross margin.  We issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement to eligible purchasers. On November 1, 2016, we and Enviva Partners Finance Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership formed on October 3, 2016 for the purpose of being the co-issuer of the notes, issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2021 (the "Senior Notes") to eligible purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which resulted in net proceeds of $293.6 million after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts of $6.4 million. On December 14, 2016, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand and the issuance of 1,098,415 unregistered common units representing limited partnership interests in the Partnership (the "common units") at a value of $27.31 per unit, or $30.0 million of common units, to affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company, funded the consideration payable for the Sampson Drop-Down. The remainder of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes were used to repay certain outstanding term loan indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As a result, our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the outstanding debt and interest expense associated with the Senior Notes.  We repaid a portion of the Original Credit Facilities and increased the capacity of our revolving credit facility. On April 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") providing for a $199.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities (the "Original Credit Facilities"). We entered into an assumption agreement on December 11, 2015, providing for $36.5 million of incremental term loan borrowings (the "Incremental Term Advances" and, together with the Original Credit Facilities, the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities") under the Credit Agreement. In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (the "Second Amendment"), which became effective upon the closing of the Sampson Drop-Down. Upon the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, a portion of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-2 and Tranche A-4 borrowings and to repay a portion of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Tranche A-1 and Tranche A-3 borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Following the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down and repayment of a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the limit under our revolving credit commitments was increased from $25.0 million to $100.0 million pursuant to the Second Amendment.  Revenue and costs for deliveries to customers can vary significantly between periods depending upon the specific shipment and reimbursement for expenses, including the then-current cost of fuel. Depending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either Cost, Insurance and Freight ("CIF") or Free on Board ("FOB"). Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. These costs are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under an FOB contract, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognition between periods, but these terms generally have little impact on gross margin.  Table of Contents  How We Generate Revenue  Overview  We primarily earn revenue by supplying wood pellets to our customers under off-take contracts, the majority of the commitments under which are long-term in nature. We refer to the structure of our contracts as "take-or-pay" because they include a firm obligation to take a fixed quantity of product at a stated price and provisions that ensure we will be compensated in the case of a customer's failure to accept all or a part of the contracted volumes or termination of the contract. Each contract defines the annual volume of wood pellets that a customer is required to purchase and we are required to sell, the fixed price per metric ton for product satisfying a base net calorific value and other technical specifications. These prices are fixed for the entire term, subject to annual inflation-based adjustments and price escalators, as well as, in some instances, price adjustments for product specifications and changes in underlying costs. In addition to sales of our product under these long-term, take-or-pay contracts, we routinely sell volumes under shorter-term contracts which range in volume and tenor and, in some cases, may include only one specific shipment. Because each of our contracts is a bilaterally negotiated agreement, our revenue over the duration of these contracts does not generally follow spot market pricing trends. Our revenue from the sale of wood pellets is recognized when the goods are shipped, title passes, the sales price to the customer is fixed, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Depending on the specific off-take contract, shipping terms are either CIF or FOB. Under a CIF contract, we procure and pay for shipping costs, which include insurance and all other charges, up to the port of destination for the customer. These costs are included in the price to the customer and, as such, are included in revenue and cost of goods sold. Under an FOB contract, the customer is directly responsible for shipping costs. Our customer shipping terms, as well as the timing and size of shipments during the year, can result in material fluctuations in our revenue recognition between periods but generally have little impact on gross margin.  The majority of the wood pellets we supply to our customers is produced at our production plants. These sales are included in "Product sales." We also fulfill our contractual commitments and take advantage of dislocations in market supply and demand by purchasing from and selling to third-party market participants, including, in some cases, our customers. In these back-to-back transactions, where title and risk of loss are immediately transferred to the ultimate purchaser, revenue is recorded net of costs paid to the third-party supplier. This revenue is included in "Other revenue."  In some instances, a customer may request to cancel, defer or accelerate a shipment. Contractually, we will seek to optimize our position by selling or purchasing the subject shipment to or from another party, either within our contracted off-take portfolio or as an independent transaction on the spot market. In most instances, the original customer pays us a fee including reimbursement of any incremental costs, which is included in "Other revenue."  Contracted Backlog  As of April 1, 2017, we had approximately $5.6 billion of product sales backlog for firm contracted product sales to power generators. Backlog represents the revenue to be recognized under existing contracts assuming deliveries occur as specified in the contracts. Contracted future product sales denominated in foreign currencies, excluding revenue hedged with foreign currency forward contracts, are included in U.S. Dollars at April 3, 2017 forward rates.  Table of Contents  Our expected future product sales revenue under our contracted backlog as of April 1, 2017 is as follows (in millions):   Period from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 $ 347 Year ending December 31, 2018 508 Year ending December 31, 2019 and thereafter 4,762 Total product sales contracted backlog $ 5,617  Costs of Conducting Our Business  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold includes the costs to produce and deliver our wood pellets to customers. The principal expenses incurred to produce and deliver our wood pellets consist of raw material, production and distribution costs.  We have strategically located our plants in the Southeastern United States, a region with plentiful wood fiber resources. We manage the supply of raw materials into our plants through a mixture of short-term and long-term contracts. Delivered wood fiber costs include stumpage (i.e., the price paid to the underlying timber resource owner for the raw material) as well as harvesting, transportation and, in some cases, size reduction services provided by our suppliers. The majority of our product volumes are sold under contracts that include cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate increases in raw material and distribution costs.  Production costs at our production plants consist of labor, energy, tooling, repairs and maintenance and plant overhead costs. Production costs also include depreciation expense associated with the use of our plants and equipment. Some of our off-take contracts include price escalators that mitigate inflationary pressure on certain components of our production costs. In addition to the wood pellets that we produce at our owned and operated production plants, we selectively purchase additional quantities of wood pellets from third-party wood pellet producers.  Distribution costs include all transport costs from our plants to our port locations, any storage or handling costs while the product remains at port and shipping costs related to the delivery of our product from our port locations to our customers. Both the strategic location of our plants and our ownership or control of our deep-water terminals has allowed for the efficient and cost-effective transportation of our wood pellets. We seek to mitigate shipping risk by entering into long-term, fixed-price shipping contracts with reputable shippers matching the terms and volumes of our contracts for which we are responsible for arranging shipping. Certain of our off-take contracts include pricing adjustments for volatility in fuel prices, which allow us to pass the majority of fuel price-risk associated with shipping through to our customers.  Additionally, as deliveries are made during the applicable contract term, we amortize the purchase price of acquired customer contracts that were recorded as intangibles.  Raw material, production and distribution costs associated with delivering our wood pellets to our deep-water terminals and third-party wood pellet purchase costs are capitalized as a component of inventory. Fixed production overhead, including the related depreciation expense, is allocated to inventory based on actual wood pellet production. These costs are reflected in cost of goods sold when inventory is sold. Distribution costs associated with shipping our wood pellets to our customers and amortization of favorable contracts are expensed as incurred. Our inventory is recorded using the first-in, first-out method ("FIFO"), which requires the use of judgment and estimates. Given the nature of our inventory, the calculation of cost of goods sold is based on estimates used in the valuation of the FIFO inventory and in determining the specific composition of inventory that is sold to each customer.  Table of Contents  General and Administrative Expenses  We and our General Partner are party to a Management Services Agreement (the "MSA") with Enviva Management Company, LLC ("Enviva Management"). Under the MSA, direct or indirect, internal or third-party expenses incurred are either directly identifiable or allocated to us. Enviva Management estimates the percentage of employee salary and related benefits, third-party costs, office rent and expenses and any other overhead costs to be provided to us. Each month, Enviva Management allocates the actual costs accumulated in the financial accounting system using these estimates. Enviva Management also charges us for any directly identifiable costs such as goods or services provided at our request. We believe Enviva Management's assumptions and allocations have been made on a reasonable basis and are the best estimate of the costs that we would have incurred on a stand-alone basis.  Our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the contribution of our sponsor's interest in Sampson as if the contribution had occurred on May 15, 2013, the date Sampson was originally organized. We do not develop plants or ports within the Partnership and therefore we do not incur startup and commissioning costs or overhead costs related to construction activities. Prior to the consummation of the Sampson Drop-Down, Sampson incurred general and administrative costs related to plant development activities, which included startup and commissioning costs as well as incremental overhead costs related to construction activities. We do not expect to incur these costs going forward as the plant began producing wood pellets during the fourth quarter of 2016.

	Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements Forward-Looking Statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this presentation that address activities, events or developments that Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) (Enviva, we, or us) expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. The words believe, expect, may, estimates, will, anticipate, plan, intend, foresee, should, would, could, or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by Enviva based on managements expectations and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate. Although Enviva believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, Enviva cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. A number of the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Enviva, and may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include the factors discussed or referenced in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently filed with the SEC, including those risks relating to financial performance and results, economic conditions and resulting capital restraints, availability of sufficient capital to execute Envivas business plan, the ability of Enviva to complete acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, impact of compliance with legislation and regulations and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. When considering the forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in such filings. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which such statement is made, and Enviva undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. All forward-looking statements attributable to Enviva are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Industry and Market Data This presentation has been prepared by Enviva and includes market data and other statistical information from third-party sources, including independent industry publications, government publications or other published independent sources. Although Enviva believes these third-party sources are reliable as of their respective dates, Enviva has not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of this information. Some data is also based on Envivas good faith estimates, which are derived from its review of internal sources as well as the third-party sources described above. 2

	Contract and Market Update - Europe  In the UK, support for the reduction of carbon emissions and renewable energy continues after the Brexit vote. In July, the U.K. announced its 5th carbon budget with emission reduction requirements for 2030, after previously announcing plans to shut down all coal-fired power plants by 2025. In October, parliament agreed to extend the governments powers to award new contract for difference (CfD)2 incentives for new low-carbon energy projects out to 2026 from the original end date of 2020  The Macquarie MGT Teesside project in the UK achieved financial close. Our sponsor is the sole supplier of the approximately 1 million MTPY of imported biomass required by the plant, and the Partnership has contracted with our sponsor to supply 470,000 MTPY of these volumes, commencing in 2019 and continuing through 2034  Drax received EU state-aid approval of the CfD for its third 660 megawatt (MW) biomass unit, anticipated to require more than 2 million MTPY  DONG Energy began burning wood pellets instead of coal at its 350 MW Studstrup unit 3 CHP plant and is currently testing wood pellets at its 215 MW Avedore unit 1 CHP plant. Dong Energy has stated half of the power and heat production at its Danish power stations must be based on biomass in 2020. The Partnership has a ten-year, 420,000 MTPY off-take contract with an affiliate of DONG Energy  In the Netherlands, the second and final round of applications for the 2016 renewable incentive program commenced in September with 5.0 billion euros in funding available. The budget for the 2016 second round was increased from 4.0 billion euros after the first round, which awarded several biomass projects a total of 2.5 billion euros in subsidies, was oversubscribed. Several utility-scale projects, including projects from RWE, Engie and Uniper, received 2016 awards. In addition, the Minister of Economic Affairs has announced that it will increase the program budget from 9.0 billion euros in 2016 to 12.0 billion euros in 2017 ¹ Hawkins Wright: The Outlook for Wood Pellets  Demand, Supply, Costs and Prices; Third quarter 2016 ² CfD  Contract for Difference is a legally binding contract with the UK government that supports biomass conversions in the UK 19 European industrial wood pellet demand expected to grow to 22 million tons by 2020, a 14% annual growth rate1

	Contract and Market Update  Asia and Rest of World  In Japan, nearly 3.2 gigawatts (GWs) of biomass-fired capacity, implying demand of more than 10 million MTPY of biomass, have been approved through the feed-in tariff (FiT) program, of which approximately 500 MWs are commissioned. The Japanese government has set a target of 6.0  7.5 GWs of biomass-fired capacity by 20302  South Korean demand is expected to grow to 2.7 million MTPY in 20201 as increases in the Renewable Portfolio Standard come into effect and several power generators consider new-build and full unit conversions to biomass  The Partnership signed an agreement to supply a minimum of 160,000 metric tons over three years to Albiomas 36.5 megawatt, biomass-fueled combined heat and power facility in Martinique, subject to the facility achieving full operation  Albiomas model is replicable in island nations around the world, highlighting the economic benefits of coupling locally-sourced biomass with imported wood pellets to displace higher-cost fossil fuels with a compelling environmental solution ¹ Hawkins Wright: The Outlook for Wood Pellets  Demand, Supply, Costs and Prices; Third quarter 2016 2 Bloomberg New Energy Finance: Japan Biomass Market Update; June 30, 2016 20 Asian industrial wood pellet demand expected to grow to more than 5 million tons by 2020, a 24% annual growth rate1

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance. Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our off-take pricing to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets. Adjusted EBITDA We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals, and certain other items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure. Distributable Cash Flow We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare cash generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. 37

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation (Cont.) Our sponsors estimates of incremental adjusted EBITDA for the Wilmington terminal are based on numerous assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The assumptions underlying our sponsors estimates of incremental adjusted EBITDA generated by certain of its assets are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, economic, financial, regulatory, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and amounts to differ materially from those estimates. For more information about such significant risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors discussed or referenced in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently filed with the SEC. A reconciliation of estimated incremental adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income is not provided because forward-looking GAAP net income generated by the Wilmington terminal is not accessible and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort. The amount of interest expense with respect to the Wilmington terminal is not accessible or estimable at this time. The amount of actual interest expense incurred could be significant, such that the actual amount of net income generated by the Wilmington terminal could vary substantially from the amount of estimated incremental adjusted EBITDA. 42

Enviva Partners, LP Reports Strong Financial Results for Full-Year 2016 and Affirms 2017 Guidance | Business Wire
























































Enviva Partners, LP Reports Strong Financial Results for Full-Year 
      2016 and Affirms 2017 Guidance






February 23, 2017 06:51 AM Eastern Standard Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE:EVA) (the “Partnership” or “we”) today 
      reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and 
      full-year 2016.
    


Highlights:



Completed the Sampson Drop-Down acquisition on December 14, 2016


Generated net revenue of $464.3 million and net income of $17.7 
        million for the full-year 2016, after giving effect to the recast for 
        the Sampson Drop-Down


Excluding the results of the Sampson Drop-Down for the period prior 
        to the Acquisition Date, generated adjusted EBITDA of $89.6 million 
        for the full-year 2016


Affirming full-year 2017 guidance for net income in a range of 
        $31.0 million to $35.0 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of 
        $110.0 million to $114.0 million, excluding the impact of any 
        additional drop-downs or third-party acquisitions



      “Strong plant performance and reduced costs across our operations 
      enabled the partnership to deliver solid financial results for the 
      year,” said John Keppler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We 
      completed the Sampson drop-down acquisition earlier than anticipated, 
      setting the stage for robust growth in 2017.”
    

Presentation of Recast Financial Results


      On December 14, 2016 (the “Acquisition Date”), we consummated the 
      acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability 
      company interests in Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC (“Sampson”). The 
      acquisition consisted of a fully operational wood pellet production 
      plant in Sampson County, North Carolina (the “Sampson Plant”), a 
      10-year, 420,000 metric tons per year (“MTPY”) off-take contract with 
      DONG Energy Thermal Power A/S (“DONG Energy”), a 15-year, 95,000 MTPY 
      off-take contract with our sponsor’s joint venture, and related 
      third-party shipping contracts (collectively, the “Sampson Drop-Down”). 
      Because the Sampson Drop-Down was a transfer between entities under 
      common control, generally accepted accounting principles in the United 
      States (“GAAP”) require that we recast our financial results to include 
      the results of the Sampson Drop-Down since the date Sampson was 
      originally organized. In addition, certain intercompany transactions 
      between us and Sampson during such periods have been eliminated and the 
      results are presented as if the assets included in the Sampson Drop-Down 
      had been the Partnership’s assets since Sampson was initially organized. 
      As a result, Sampson’s results are now included in our results presented 
      in accordance with GAAP. The effect of this recast is to present 
      financial statements as if the Partnership had developed the Sampson 
      plant when in fact it is our sponsor’s strategy to develop new projects 
      outside the Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial 
      results presented in this release are recast on this basis.
    

Annual Financial Results


      For the full-year 2016, we generated net revenue of $464.3 million, an 
      increase of 1.5 percent, or $6.9 million, from 2015. Included in net 
      revenue were product sales of $444.5 million during 2016 and $451.0 
      million during 2015. Other revenue increased to $19.8 million in 2016 
      from $6.4 million for 2015, principally due to increased fees earned 
      related to customer requests to adjust the timing of or cancel 
      shipments. We generated net income of $17.7 million in 2016 compared to 
      $19.5 million last year, a decrease of $1.7 million, driven principally 
      by a $10.0 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the 
      planned sale of our smallest production plant located in Wiggins, 
      Mississippi, and higher interest expense.
    

      Excluding the results of the Sampson Drop-Down for the period prior to 
      the Acquisition Date, adjusted EBITDA for 2016 was $89.6 million, an 
      increase of 16.0 percent, or $12.4 million, from 2015. The increase in 
      adjusted EBITDA was driven by increased other revenue and cost 
      improvements across our operations during 2016, primarily related to 
      increased plant utilization, lower raw material costs and lower fuel 
      costs that reduced our to-port logistics costs. Distributable cash flow, 
      prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights 
      paid to the general partner, was $68.8 million.
    

Fourth Quarter Financial Results


      For the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated net revenue of $126.5 
      million, an increase of 8.3 percent, or $9.7 million, from the 
      corresponding quarter of 2015. Included in net revenue were product 
      sales of $121.2 million, an increase of $6.1 million from the 
      corresponding quarter of last year due to an increased number of 
      shipments under CIF contracts, which had the effect of increasing 
      revenue and cost of sales, as well as favorable contract pricing mix. We 
      had a net loss of $8.1 million compared to net income of $7.6 million 
      for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $15.7 million, driven by 
      the non-cash impairment charge mentioned above and an increase in 
      interest expense.
    

      Excluding the results of the Sampson Drop-Down for the period prior to 
      the Acquisition Date, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 
      $22.2 million, an increase of 3.1 percent, or $0.7 million, from the 
      corresponding period in 2015. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven 
      by increased product sales and lower raw material costs. Distributable 
      cash flow, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive 
      distribution rights paid to the general partner, was $12.9 million.
    

Distribution


      As announced February 1, 2017, the board of directors of our general 
      partner declared a distribution of $0.5350 per common and subordinated 
      unit for the fourth quarter of 2016. This distribution is 16.3 percent 
      higher than the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015. The 
      quarterly distribution will be paid on Tuesday, February 28, 2017, to 
      unitholders of record as of the close of business on Wednesday, 
      February 15, 2017.
    

      Including the fourth quarter distribution, the Partnership will have 
      distributed $2.10 per common and subordinated unit for full-year 2016. 
      The Partnership’s distributable cash flow, excluding the results of the 
      Sampson Drop-Down for the period prior to the Acquisition Date and net 
      of amounts attributable to incentive distribution rights, was $67.8 
      million for 2016, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.28 
      times.
    

Outlook and Guidance


      Consistent with the guidance provided on November 3, 2016, the 
      Partnership expects full-year 2017 net income to be in the range of 
      $31.0 million to $35.0 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 
      $110.0 million to $114.0 million. The Partnership expects to incur 
      maintenance capital expenditures of $5.0 million and interest expense 
      net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount 
      of $29.0 million in 2017. As a result, the Partnership expects full-year 
      distributable cash flow to be in the range of $76.0 million to $80.0 
      million, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive 
      distribution rights paid to the general partner. For full-year 2017, we 
      expect to distribute at least $2.35 per common and subordinated unit. 
      The guidance amounts provided above do not include the impact of any 
      additional acquisitions from the Partnership’s sponsor or third parties. 
      Although deliveries to our customers are generally ratable over the 
      year, the Partnership’s quarterly income and cash flow are subject to 
      modest seasonality in the first quarter and to the mix of customer 
      shipments made, which may vary from period to period. As such, the board 
      of directors of the Partnership’s general partner evaluates the 
      Partnership’s distribution coverage ratio on an annual basis when 
      determining the distribution for a quarter.
    

Market and Contracting Update


      Our sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the 
      Partnership. Our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of 
      off-take contracts that has a weighted-average remaining term of 9.8 
      years from February 1, 2017.
    

      Independent industry experts Hawkins Wright project that worldwide 
      demand for industrial wood pellets will increase to approximately 27 
      million tons in 2020, representing an annual growth rate of nearly 20 
      percent, driven predominantly by biomass consumption in Europe and Asia. 
      The following are key recent developments:
    


        DONG Energy, the largest power producer in Denmark, announced in 
        February 2017 that it will completely eliminate the use of coal in its 
        generation of power and heat by 2023, and will replace the fuel with 
        biomass. DONG Energy already has two facilities burning wood pellets, 
        which are expected to consume approximately 1.8 million MTPY of wood 
        pellets at full capacity.
      

        In December, Drax Power Limited (“Drax”) received EU state-aid 
        approval of the contract for difference (CfD) through 2027 for its 
        third 660 megawatt (“MW”) biomass unit, which is anticipated to 
        require more than 2 million MTPY of wood pellets. Drax has stated that 
        it could convert the remaining three coal-burning units to biomass in 
        the next two to three years under the right conditions.
      

        In the Netherlands, biomass projects were awarded the majority of the 
        5.0 billion euros in funding available through the second and final 
        round of applications for the 2016 renewable incentive program, 
        including 2.1 billion euros awarded to coal plants planning to co-fire 
        biomass. Both rounds in 2016 were heavily oversubscribed, and RWE, 
        Engie, and Uniper received awards. The Minister of Economic Affairs 
        has announced that the program budget will be increased from 9.0 
        billion euros in 2016 to 12.0 billion euros in 2017.
      

        In November, Japan ratified the Paris climate agreement, demonstrating 
        the government’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions. As part of 
        their plan for significant emissions reductions by 2030, Japan has set 
        a target of 6.0 – 7.5 gigawatts (“GWs”) of biomass-fired capacity, of 
        which nearly 3.2 GWs have been approved through Japan’s feed-in tariff 
        (FiT) program with many other projects that are either awaiting 
        approval or expected to apply prior to the September deadline for the 
        2017 award applications. Several power producers have announced 
        biomass projects, including Japan’s largest electricity wholesaler, 
        Electric Power Development Company (J-Power), which stated recently it 
        expects to co-fire biomass at all seven of its coal-fired plants.
      

        Several recently announced biomass-fueled projects in South Korea are 
        expected to be operational by 2020, increasing the expected South 
        Korean demand for wood pellets up to 6 million MTPY. As this demand is 
        well in excess of expected domestic supply, a significant amount of 
        wood pellets are expected to be imported under long-term contracts, 
        representing a shift from the short-term tender mechanism currently 
        used to purchase biomass in South Korea.
      

        In January, China’s National Energy Administration announced that the 
        country will spend at least $360.0 billion on renewable energy through 
        2030. In addition, published reports indicate that China is expected 
        to increase biomass-fired generation capacity from 10.3 GWs in 2015 to 
        15.0 GWs by 2020.
      


Sponsor Activity


      Construction of our sponsor’s deep-water marine terminal in Wilmington, 
      North Carolina (the “Wilmington terminal”) is complete. The first 
      shipment was loaded in December 2016, the facility receives regular 
      deliveries via truck and rail, and routinely loads vessels consistent 
      with our sponsor’s expectations. The Partnership expects to have the 
      opportunity to acquire the Wilmington terminal in 2017.
    

      Our sponsor’s joint venture is currently completing the detailed design 
      for a build-and-copy replica of the Sampson plant at a permitted site in 
      Hamlet, North Carolina, to supply MGT Power’s Teesside Renewable Energy 
      Plant. In order to supply anticipated incremental volume growth in 
      Europe and the emerging Asian market, our sponsor is also evaluating 
      additional production capacity investments at its sites in Lucedale, 
      Mississippi and Abbeville, Alabama, as well as other sites positioned to 
      take advantage of the existing terminal capacity at our Port of 
      Chesapeake and the Port of Wilmington. In addition, our sponsor 
      continues to evaluate its option to build and operate a marine export 
      terminal at the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, which could support 
      pellet production from the potential plant in Lucedale, Mississippi and 
      other potential facilities in the region.
    

Conference Call


      We will host a conference call with executive management related to our 
      fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results and to discuss our outlook and 
      guidance, and a more detailed market update, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern 
      Time) on Thursday, February 23, 2017. Information on how interested 
      parties may listen to the conference call is available in the Investor 
      Relations page of our website (www.envivabiomass.com). 
      A replay of the conference call will be available on our website after 
      the live call concludes.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      We provide results in this release that (i) do not give effect to the 
      recast of financial results and assume the Sampson Drop-Down had not 
      occurred or (ii) include financial results of assets excluding the 
      period prior to the Acquisition Date. These illustrative presentations 
      are not presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered 
      alternatives to the presentation of the recast financial results of the 
      Partnership. Management views these presentations as important to 
      reflect the Partnership’s actual performance during 2016, including as 
      measured against our published guidance for 2016, which did not include 
      the impact of acquisitions.
    

      We use adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and 
      distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance.
    

Adjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton


      We define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding depreciation 
      and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted 
      gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares 
      our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of 
      profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross 
      margin per metric ton will be affected primarily by our ability to meet 
      targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs 
      associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production 
      plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.
    

Adjusted EBITDA


      We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation 
      and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement 
      of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset 
      impairments and disposals and certain items of income or loss that we 
      characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted 
      EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users 
      of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and 
      research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets 
      without regard to financing methods or capital structure.
    

Distributable Cash Flow


      We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance 
      capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt 
      issuance costs and original issue discount. We use distributable cash 
      flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance 
      of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the 
      cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash 
      distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. 
      We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.
    

      Adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable 
      cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 
      We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures 
      provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial 
      condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures 
      should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable 
      GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has 
      important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, 
      but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP 
      financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per 
      metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, or distributable cash flow in isolation or 
      as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our 
      definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable 
      to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing 
      their utility.
    

      The following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin 
      per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most 
      directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as applicable, for each of 
      the periods indicated.

Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements and information in this press release, including 
      those concerning our future results of operations, acquisition 
      opportunities, and distributions, may constitute “forward-looking 
      statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” 
      “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which 
      are generally not historical in nature. These forward-looking statements 
      are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and beliefs 
      concerning future developments and their potential effect on the 
      Partnership. Although management believes that these forward-looking 
      statements are reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that 
      future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it 
      anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks 
      and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control) 
      and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from the Partnership’s historical experience and its present 
      expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, 
      but are not limited to: (i) the volume of products that we are able to 
      sell; (ii) the price at which we are able to sell our products; (iii) 
      failure of the Partnership’s customers, vendors, and shipping partners 
      to pay or perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership; (iv) 
      the creditworthiness of our financial counterparties; (v) the amount of 
      low-cost wood fiber that we are able to procure and process, which could 
      be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or financial 
      difficulties suffered by our suppliers; (vi) the amount of products that 
      we are able to produce, which could be adversely affected by, among 
      other things, operating difficulties; (vii) changes in the price and 
      availability of natural gas, coal, or other sources of energy; (viii) 
      changes in prevailing economic conditions; (ix) the ability of the 
      Partnership to complete acquisitions, including acquisitions from our 
      sponsor, and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions; (x) 
      unanticipated ground, grade, or water conditions; (xi) inclement or 
      hazardous weather conditions, including extreme precipitation, 
      temperatures, and flooding; (xii) environmental hazards; (xiii) fires, 
      explosions, or other accidents; (xiv) changes in domestic and foreign 
      laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to 
      renewable or low-carbon energy, the forestry products industry, or power 
      generators; (xv) changes in the regulatory treatment of biomass in core 
      and emerging markets for utility-scale generation; (xvi) the inability 
      to acquire or maintain necessary permits or rights for our production, 
      transportation, and terminaling operations; (xvii) the inability to 
      obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts; (xviii) 
      operating or technical difficulties or failures at our plants or ports; 
      (xix) labor disputes; (xx) the inability of our customers to take 
      delivery of our products; (xxi) changes in the price and availability of 
      transportation; (xxii) changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 
      (xxiii) changes in interest rates; (xxiv) failure of our hedging 
      arrangements to effectively reduce our exposure to interest and foreign 
      currency exchange rate risk; (xxv) risks related to our indebtedness; 
      (xxvi) customer rejection due to our failure to maintain effective 
      quality control systems at our production plants and deep-water marine 
      terminals; (xxvii) changes in the quality specifications for our 
      products that are required by our customers; (xxviii) the effects of the 
      approval of the United Kingdom of the exit of the United Kingdom 
      (“Brexit”) from the European Union, and the implementation of Brexit, in 
      each case on our and our customers’ businesses; and (xxix) the ability 
      of the Partnership to borrow funds and access capital markets.

Operational Excellence | Safety
Wood pellet manufacturing is our core business. A successful pelleting operation requires specialized expertise in a number of areas.  Enviva has assembled the people, suppliers, and capabilities to manage the breadth of activities required for successful execution from forest to ship.We source and manage a feedstock supply chain every day.
With vertical integration into chipping operations and registered foresters on staff, we have over 100 years of experience in procuring biomass. We know how to make and deliver pellets for industry.  Our team of engineers and operations people are not from utilities, but rather from manufacturing.  We understand how to manage safety, quality, reliability and costs to ensure we meet manufacturing specifications and exceed customer expectations. We know inventory management and how to manage the logistic chain that is specific and particular to moving pellets cost effectively and without product degradation.

ABOUT ENVIVA
Enviva was founded in 2004 with a clear purpose in mind: We wanted to develop a cleaner energy alternative to fossil fuels. In particular, we wanted to offer electric utilities a fuel to replace coal, enabling them to generate power without interruption while reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.
More than a decade later, Enviva has become the world’s largest producer of wood pellets – a small and seemingly ordinary product that is addressing these big challenges and delivering real results.
Enviva owns and operates six plants strategically located in the southeastern United States that produce nearly 3 million metric tons of wood pellets annually. We export our pellets primarily to power plants in the United Kingdom and Europe that previously were fueled by coal, enabling them to reduce their lifetime carbon footprint by about 80%. We make our pellets using sustainable practices that protect Southern forests. And we employ about 600 people and support many other businesses in the rural South, where jobs and economic opportunity are sometimes scarce.
At Enviva, our job is more than making pellets. We work for lower emissions, healthy forests and strong communities.
Enviva conducts its activities primarily through two entities: Enviva Partners, LP, a publicly-traded master limited partnership (NYSE: EVA), and Enviva Development Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned private company.
Enviva Partners, LP
Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that aggregates a natural resource, wood fiber, and processes it into a transportable form, wood pellets. Enviva Partners sells a significant majority of its wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay agreements with creditworthy customers in the United Kingdom and Europe. The Partnership owns and operates six plants with a combined production capacity of nearly 3 million metric tons of wood pellets per year in Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida.
In addition, the Partnership owns a deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia, which is used to export wood pellets. Enviva Partners also exports pellets through the ports of Wilmington, NC; Mobile, AL; and Panama City, FL.
Enviva Development Holdings, LLC
Enviva Development Holdings, LLC develops and builds wood pellet production plants and export terminals. It has a pipeline of projects under development to support incremental projected demand for wood pellets.
Through a joint venture with the Hancock Natural Resource Group and other affiliates of the John Hancock Life Insurance Company, Enviva Development Holdings owns a deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Wilmington, NC, and is completing the detailed design work for the permitted plant site in Hamlet, NC.

Enviva Partners, LP Receives Offer to Acquire Sampson Production Plant




    Monday, October 17, 2016 4:36 pm EDT  



      Dateline:          




                    BETHESDA, Md.        






EmailPDFPrintRSS 



      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:EVA 






BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) (the “Partnership” or “we”) today 
      announced that Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC (the “Hancock JV”), a 
      joint venture between an affiliate of Enviva Holdings, LP and affiliates 
      of John Hancock Life Insurance Company, has offered to sell the entity 
      which owns the wood pellet production plant in Sampson County, North 
      Carolina (the “Sampson plant”), along with a 10-year, 420,000 metric ton 
      per year (“MTPY”) off-take contract with an affiliate of DONG Energy, to 
      the Partnership. The transaction also includes a 15-year, 95,000 MTPY 
      off-take contract with the Hancock JV and a third-party shipping 
      contract. As previously announced, the board of directors of the 
      Partnership’s general partner has formed a Conflicts Committee comprised 
      solely of independent directors to evaluate the offer. The final 
      purchase price and other terms are subject to negotiation with, and 
      approval of, the Conflicts Committee, but the Partnership currently 
      expects the final purchase price to be between $170 million and $180 
      million. Assuming terms of the acquisition are agreed upon, the 
      Partnership expects the transaction to close on or about January 3, 2017.
    

      Construction of the Sampson plant is complete and the plant is producing 
      wood pellets for sale. The Sampson plant is expected to produce 
      approximately 500,000 MTPY of wood pellets in 2017 and to reach its full 
      production capacity of approximately 600,000 MTPY in 2019. The Sampson 
      plant is expected to generate incremental Adjusted EBITDA of 
      approximately $22 million for 2017, increasing to approximately $27 
      million once full production capacity is achieved. Assuming completion 
      of the drop-down acquisition, the weighted average remaining term of the 
      Partnership’s off-take contracts would extend to 9.7 years and our 
      contracted revenue backlog would increase to $5.7 billion as of January 
      1, 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures



Adjusted EBITDA



      We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation 
      and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement 
      of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset 
      impairments and disposals, and certain other items of income or loss 
      that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and 
      other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial 
      banks, and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our 
      assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.
    

      Our estimates of incremental adjusted EBITDA from the Sampson plant are 
      based on numerous assumptions that are subject to significant risks and 
      uncertainties. The assumptions underlying such estimates are inherently 
      uncertain and subject to significant business, economic, financial, 
      regulatory, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause 
      actual results and amounts to differ materially from those estimates. 
      For more information about such significant risks and uncertainties, 
      please see the risk factors discussed or referenced in our filings with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including the Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently 
      filed with the SEC. A reconciliation of estimated incremental adjusted 
      EBITDA to GAAP net income is not provided because forward-looking GAAP 
      net income generated by the Sampson plant is not accessible and 
      reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort. 
      The amount of interest expense with respect to the Sampson plant is not 
      accessible or estimable at this time. The amount of actual interest 
      expense incurred could be significant, such that the actual amount of 
      net income generated by the Sampson plant could vary substantially from 
      the respective amount of estimated incremental adjusted EBITDA.
    

Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements and information in this press release, including 
      those concerning our future results of operations, acquisition 
      opportunities, and distributions, may constitute “forward-looking 
      statements.” The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” 
      “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which 
      are generally not historical in nature. These forward-looking statements 
      are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and beliefs 
      concerning future developments and their potential effect on the 
      Partnership. Although management believes that these forward-looking 
      statements are reasonable when made, there can be no assurance that 
      future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it 
      anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks 
      and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control) 
      and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      from the Partnership’s historical experience and its present 
      expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, 
      but are not limited to: (i) the amount of products that the Partnership 
      is able to produce, which could be adversely affected by, among other 
      things, operating difficulties; (ii) the volume of products that the 
      Partnership is able to sell; (iii) the price at which the Partnership is 
      able to sell products; (iv) changes in the price and availability of 
      natural gas, coal, or other sources of energy; (v) changes in prevailing 
      economic conditions; (vi) the Partnership’s ability to complete 
      acquisitions, including acquisitions from its sponsor; (vii) our ability 
      to successfully negotiate and complete the acquisition of the Sampson 
      plant and associated contracts (the “Sampson Acquisition”), integrate 
      the Sampson plant into our existing operations, and realize the 
      anticipated benefits of the Sampson Acquisition; (viii) unanticipated 
      ground, grade, or water conditions; (ix) inclement or hazardous weather 
      conditions, including extreme precipitation, temperatures, and flooding; 
      (x) environmental hazards; (xi) fires, explosions, or other accidents; 
      (xii) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations (or the 
      interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low-carbon energy, the 
      forestry products industry, or power generators; (xiii) inability to 
      acquire or maintain necessary permits; (xiv) inability to obtain 
      necessary production equipment or replacement parts; (xv) technical 
      difficulties or failures; (xvi) labor disputes; (xvii) late delivery of 
      raw materials; (xviii) inability of the Partnership’s customers to take 
      delivery or their rejection of delivery of products; (xix) failure of 
      the Partnership’s customers to pay or perform their contractual 
      obligations to the Partnership; (xx) changes in the price and 
      availability of transportation; and (xxi) the Partnership’s ability to 
      borrow funds and access capital markets.
    

      For additional information regarding known material factors that could 
      cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results, 
      please read its filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently filed 
      with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on 
      forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The 
      Partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
