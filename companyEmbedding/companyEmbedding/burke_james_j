James E. Burke, whose leadership of Johnson & Johnson during the Tylenol poisonings in the 1980s is regarded as a textbook example of how to handle a public relations crisis, died on Friday at a health care facility near New Brunswick, N.J. He was 87.His death was confirmed by his son, James.As Johnson & Johnson’s chairman and chief executive from 1976 until his retirement in 1989, Mr. Burke oversaw a vast expansion of the company, which now sells a variety of products like baby shampoo, prescription drugs and artificial hips. Sales tripled to $9 billion a year, and the company began doing business in many more countries.But Mr. Burke is best known for his handling of the Tylenol crisis in 1982, when seven people in the Chicago area died after taking capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide. In 1986, another poisoned capsule killed a woman in Yonkers. The crimes have never been solved.The company spent more than $100 million recalling 32 million bottles of Tylenol capsules from store shelves in 1982, and even more on another recall in 1986. And Mr. Burke placed himself before news cameras and apologized.

In a news conference in 1986 announcing that Johnson & Johnson would stop selling its over-the-counter products in capsules, which could be tampered with, and switch to solid caplets, a reporter asked if Mr. Burke was sorry the company had not acted sooner. “Yes, indeed I am,” he said.

“That taught corporations a lesson about candor,” John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said on Monday in a telephone interview. “It was a huge legacy to leave: When you have a problem, deal with it openly, up front.”Those who knew Mr. Burke said he thrived on lively debate and sought opinions wherever he went. Three days into the first Tylenol poisonings in 1982, he traveled to Vermont to visit his son for parents’ weekend at Middlebury College. His son said he had assumed that his father would be too busy to make the trip, but Mr. Burke insisted and took eight of his son’s friends out to dinner.

“He sat and he asked each one of them, ‘If you were me, what would you do?’ ” James Burke, who is an independent film producer, recalled on Monday. “He asked everybody he could think of what would be the right thing to do, and then took what made sense to him and his values.”Within months in 1982, Johnson & Johnson had returned Tylenol to the market in new, tamper-resistant packaging — the scare prompted Congress to pass antitampering legislation — and it took just one more year before the company recovered its position as the top-selling over-the-counter pain reliever.James Edward Burke was born in Rutland, Vt., on Feb. 28, 1925, a son of James and Mary Barnett Burke. He grew up in Slingerlands, N.Y., a small town outside Albany.

This post is in partnership with Knowledge@Wharton, the online research and business analysis journal of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The article below was originally published at knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu.
James Burke received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000 and was named one of history’s 10 greatest CEOs by Fortune magazine in 2003. But it was for his handling of the Tylenol tragedy back in 1982 that Burke, CEO of Johnson & Johnson from 1976 to 1989, will be remembered most. Burke died last week at age 87.

In 1982, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced extra-strength Tylenol capsules sold in five Chicago stores. Before that happened, Tylenol, sold by J&J’s McNeil Consumer Products division, had 35% of the $1.2 billion analgesic market. After the deaths, J&J’s market share dropped to 7%.
Under Burke’s leadership, the company spent $100 million to recall 31 million bottles of Tylenol and re-launched the product two months later in tamper-proof packaging. Burke’s actions have become a legendary example of good crisis management, serving as the basis for case studies in numerous business schools and management books.

Burke not only saved the reputation of the company, but he also saved the brand as well. By mid-1983, Tylenol’s share of the analgesic market had climbed to 30%, reaching 35% by the end of the year.
In a 2004 Wharton School Publishing Book titled, Lasting Leadership: What You Can Learn from the Top 25 Business People of Our Times, Burke emphasized the value of the J&J credo, dating back to the company’s founding in 1887, which stated that the company is responsible first to its customers, then to its employees, the community and the stockholders, in that order. “The credo is all about the consumer,” Burke said. When those seven deaths occurred, “the credo made it very clear at that point exactly what we were all about. It gave me the ammunition I needed to persuade shareholders and others to spend the $100 million on the recall. The credo helped sell it.”
In his interview for Lasting Leadership, Burke also spoke about trust. “Trust has been an operative word in my life. [It] embodies almost everything you can strive for that will help you to succeed. You tell me any human relationship that works without trust, whether it is a marriage or a friendship or a social interaction; in the long run, the same thing is true about business.”
Ironically, Johnson & Johnson has recently experienced a number of setbacks that “have caused many to question whether the firm has lost sight of that credo,” according to a Knowledge@Wharton article earlier this year. The company’s problems with plants in Fort Washington, Pa., Lancaster, Pa., and Puerto Rico — the sites associated with recalls of over-the-counter products like Benadryl and Children’s Tylenol – “dragged on for years,” the article notes. Two hip devices were recalled in 2010 for post-surgical complications, and the company agreed to pay $158 million to the state of Texas to settle claims it improperly marketed the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal to some patients. Other suits surrounding the marketing of this drug are ongoing. Recalls of surgical sutures and contact lenses have been announced as well.
(MORE: 10 Questions for Ty Burrell)
Years earlier, as Lasting Leadership noted, other companies had demonstrated what came to be seen as poor judgment in the way they handled defective product incidents. For example, Coca-Cola had mismanaged the “contaminated can” incident in Europe in 1999; Intel had initially failed to respond quickly to the calculation errors embedded in its Pentium chip in 1994, and Firestone had initially refused to accept responsibility for SUV roll-overs caused by poorly manufactured tires in 2000.
Burke’s actions were the opposite. According to media reports at the time, the Tylenol crisis led the news every night on every station for six weeks. Burke, however, met the challenge head on, contacting the chief of each network’s news divisions in order to keep them informed. He also met with the directors of the FBI and the FDA. “There were many people in the company who felt there was no possible way to save the brand, that it was the end of Tylenol,” Burke said. “But the fact is, I had confidence in J&J and its reputation, and also confidence in the public to respond to what was right. It helped turn Tylenol into a billion-dollar business.”
The person who placed the cyanide in the Tylenol capsules was never found.

James E. Burke (February 28, 1925 – September 28, 2012) was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Johnson & Johnson from 1976 to 1989, a company for which he worked forty years.[2]
Early life[edit]
Burke was born in Rutland, Vermont. He earned his BA at the College of the Holy Cross in 1947 and his MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1949.
Career[edit]
J&J announced that Richard B. Sellars would step down as CEO as of November 1, 1976, and be replaced by Burke.[3] As CEO, Burke is credited for the growth of Johnson & Johnson to its current size and prominence, but he is perhaps best known for his crisis management in 1982, when it was found that Tylenol capsules had been poisoned with cyanide.[4]
According to a Fortune article, Burke's "defining moment" actually came six years earlier when he challenged his fellow executives to either recommit to the company credo or "tear it off the wall."
Penned by J&J scion and legendary chairman General Robert Wood Johnson II in the 1940s, the credo proclaimed that J&J's "first responsibility" was to its customers and then to employees, management, communities, and stockholders-in that order.
By the mid-1970s, however, Burke was troubled by a sense that the credo had lost its influence in the organization. "When I asked people what they thought of it, I got vague answers," he says. But during a series of "challenge" meetings he arranged, executives debated the credo in the context of the company's history and mission. "It became clear that our value system had been vital to our ability to outperform the competition for nearly one hundred years," Burke recalls. "Whenever we cared for the customer in a profound-and spiritual-way, profits were never a problem."
The Tylenol crisis could have been a death blow to the brand and, potentially, the company itself, continues Burke. "Innocent people were killed. Industry analysts and advertising experts told us that Tylenol was finished."
As several HBS case studies point out, Tylenol was the country's best-selling over-the-counter pain reliever at the time of the poisonings, with 35 percent of the market-more than the next three brands combined. Yet within a year of the crisis, thanks to decisions by Burke and his team to recall millions of bottles and replace them in a matter of weeks with pioneering tamper-resistant packaging while keeping the media and public well informed, the product had regained 85 percent of its market share. By the mid-1980s, Tylenol had rebounded completely. The customer confidence and goodwill Johnson & Johnson had built up also enabled it to overcome another poisoning incident in 1986-an event that resulted in the replacement of capsules with caplets.
Following his retirement, he was appointed the second chairman of the national nonprofit organization Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA), formed by a consortium of advertising professionals who ran a research-based media campaign to discourage teenage use of illegal drugs such as marijuana.[5] Burke was honored for his public service advertising work by then US president Bill Clinton, who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. Fortune magazine named him as one of the ten greatest CEOs of all time and he has a membership in the National Business Hall of Fame.[6]
He also received the Bower Award for Business Leadership in 1990.
In 1993, Burke received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[7]
He was President of the Business Enterprise Trust that honored acts of courage, integrity and social conscience in business.

Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs.

For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash.If I have insurance can I still shop around for a better rate?Yes. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easy. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.How do I file a life insurance claim?Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.How do I file a homeowners insurance claim?In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved.

I was ordered deported and was detained for many months and was going to be deported to my home country.  Mr. Helt stopped my deportation, reopened my case, removed my deportation order and obtained my release.  From that moment on, Mr. Helt was always with me during my saga to legalize my status and stand up for my rights.  HE FOUGHT FOR ME -- for years in the district courts and the immigration courtrooms and in different cities.  I was deported in Los Angeles and Mr. Helt was there for me.  My bond hearing was in Louisiana, and Mr. Helt was there for me.  Mr. Helt was there for me at the Memphis court to help me obtain my lawful permanent residency.  My immigration case was never easy.  Even on the last day of my immigration trial, it was a very contested hearing.   We won and Mr. Helt many times spoke up for me, made numerous objections, protected my rights, made sure that I was treated like a human being and with respect.  And Mr. Helt later represented my wife.  The day before her interview, there was a big snow storm in Chicago and the flights were cancelled.  Mr. Helt left the airport and drove to Memphis overnight (THROUGH A SNOW STORM) so he could be with us at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.  My wife got her green card, thanks to Christopher Helt.  What Mr. Helt did for me and my family was amazing and is superhuman. I can honestly say I don't think there will ever be another lawyer who fights for the South Asian community like Mr. Helt.Lannon Lannon & Barrderek.schultz.965 ratedThis law firm is amazing, espe...This law firm is amazing, especially Patricia Lannon, who handled my case incredibly well. My workers' compensation case began in 2005. My first attempt at finding a lawyer to represent me did not go well. Within months it became apparent he didn't know what he was doing, and even more so when he withdrew his counsel 3 years later. The opposing lawyers loved this, and began calling my house, taunting me, telling me to just give up. And it WAS a very difficult case, I knew this, and so I began to think maybe it WAS hopeless. But thanks to the anger I felt from their phone calls and my mom's encouragement , I pursued the case. I knew I was right, and so I started to look for a better lawyer.That's when I found Lannon Lannon & Barr. In the beginning they were unsure of the outcome, and they told me it would be a very difficult case. They didn't give up on me though, and before I knew it the case was building and moving forward. Suddenly everything started to look like maybe I actually had a chance. I knew very quickly that I had found a very good lawyer.We won the case. After losing two more appeals the insurance company finally gave up, firing the lawyers who had originally harassed me and admitting defeat. I can't even express in words how excited I am with the outcome. I sincerely recommend this law firm to everyone and anyone who needs a good workers' compensation attorney. They WON'T give up on you; they know EXACTLY what they are doing, and they work HARD for you! Call them!Budin Law OfficesB A. ratedI and two more students were hit by a car in the cross walk in a school campus. I don't have any family or relatives in here so i contacted with one of the student office for a lawyer suggestion, they suggested Adam Ingber. this guy took my case and was interested in the beginning. 6 months later he learned driver does not have very good insurance, there is very limited money. he said he can't do anything for my case, he needs to run a business and i should just go hospital and cry then they might waive my bill. i had a horrible legal service experience until i meet with Budin Law Offices (John Budin).He is very experienced and helpful attorney. First of all, he took my case although there was not so much money, he really wanted to help me. Since there were 3 people and limited money, it was very challenging to get equal amounts of money among 3 people. I ended up getting equal amount with others (although i had less injury), which is great for me. He knows what he is doing! and he is trying everything to make your case better. He only contacted with me 1-2 times during all this process, he takes care everything in an amazing way. i was very depressed after accident and my first bad attorney experience. I appreciate John Budin Law office, my case is successfully solved. they did a great job in my case. I will definitely suggest John Budin if you need a legal service. He solves challenging cases in a smart way and he is very supportive and trustable person. Sakina Carbide Law OfficeS. M. ratedI know Sakina Carbide for the past 19 years, she helped me with my immigration case in year 2000 for my status change to permanent resident. Everything went smooth all due to her guidance and her preparing me. Recently, she has helped us with my wife immigration case from fiancée visa in 2008, then permanent resident in 2009 and finally citizenship in 2017. Sakina Carbide has always been our number one choice. She is very hardworking, dedicated, friendly, and competent lawyer in Chicago, IL area. She has treated us like family and cares about her clients from the bottom of her heart. Her fees are very reasonable, and she will spend the extra time with you if needed on top of that she will be present with you during your interview.  She is our lawyer for all our future legal needs. I would highly recommend Sakina Carbide to anyone and everyone who needs a lawyer. I thank her for all the help she has provided me and my family, God bless her and her family. She is an excellent attorney! Second to none.O'Malley, Veronica MTrent S. ratedI Would Like To Thank The Extremely Honorable Judge Veronica M. O'Malley. It Was An Absolute  Honor To Be In Your Presence May 17 2017 In Your Court Room. My Only Regret Is I Was Not Able To Film The Total Smack Down! Your vision for evil I observed emediately. The patience you possess is undeniable considering the total fabrications from the Petitioner you had to endure. Even know you seen right through her lies from the onset you displayed considerable Open-mindedness, courtesy, and tact. Your courage was inspiring considering the danger I was portrayed by that old lady. You assessed us both with punctuality, firmness, understanding, and compassion. In the end you resolved the issue with humility and common sense. You Are An Extremely Beautiful Person ... Inside And Outside! Thank You, I Love You and May God Bless Every Thing You Do!I have been blessed with unparalleled vision, For DEER and Evil!ALL GLORY GOES TO GOD  ... Without the Lord Jesus Christ I am nothingSal Sheikh - Attorney at LawAnonymous C. ratedI hired Mr. Sheikh due to the fact that he is professional, knowledgeable, a great listener, easy to talk to and most importantly acts with a sense of urgency.  I received a phone call within the hour I left him a message! A bright and compassionate attorney, from our first conversation he made me feel at ease and did not judge me for the situation I had placed myself in (criminal charges).  Once we met in person I could tell he had the experience and expertise I needed for my situation.  I’m so thankful he took my case; other attorneys’ plans were not good options for me and Sal had a different plan and approach that worked!  He worked around my schedule, patiently answered all my questions and explained what to expect several times over the course of my year-long ordeal.  Sal’s been doing this a long time, is very good at what he does and knows what to do to get you the best outcome for your case. Call Sal!Jim Tom - State Farm Insurance Agentharold_l ratedA+ is the grade I would bestow...A+ is the grade I would bestow upon my agent Jim Tom, and my sincere appreciation for the recent refund I received from his corporate office. It all started with a recent $89 bump up on my Honda insurance. I called agent Tom's office, who took the time to review my policies to make sure everything was up to date. After I had let him know I no longer drove my Honda to work, he advised me that would lower the premium. I had already sent my payment in, but recently I received a refund check for about the same amount it had increased. In reviewing my condo policy, he discovered I no longer needed the large coverage which I had, plus he also bumped up my deductible, which resulted in me getting another nice refund back on my condo policy. In this day and age of insurance companies not looking out the the little guy, I'm glad I have agent Tom to look out for my back. Sal Sheikh - Attorney at LawBrandon R. ratedSalim J Sheikh was not was what I was expecting from a lawyer. He not only soothed my anxieties about my case, but he also gave me back my dignity and hope. The man has worked tirelessly for me and has included me in every step of the process. He has given me more of his time than I would ever reasonably expect from law practitioner. Not only is Mr. Sheikh on top of all things case related, he is also very wise and sharp as a tac. When trouble came looking for me Sal immediately came to my home and discussed the case. From there we drafted a reasonable retainer agreement that allowed me to still keep my head above water. This case was the most serious case I have ever faced and Mr. Sheikh has walked me through the maze. I could not hope for a better Attorney and counselor. Finally I could not recommend Mr. Sheikh more.Azita M. MojaradTudor M. ratedAzita Mojarad is hands down, one of the best attorneys in the Chicagoland area! Azita, along with her knowledgeable team, have represented myself as well as my friends and family for the past 15 years. Sometimes life has its downs, for many of us... Well, fortunately, Azita has always made sure I always come up on top! No matter what the circumstances were, no matter how hard the case was, no matter what time of day or night I called, in need of advice, or a bond, she was always there. In this day and age, when the legal ramifications are getting more and more complex, when problems sometimes seem unsolvable, the need for excellent legal advice is needed more than ever, in order to succeed. This is why I highly recommend Azita Mojarad as well as her team of highly experienced attorneys!  David M. Smith Attorney at LawBarbara L. ratedI was charged with Domestic Battery and a Order of Protection was issued on me in my own house. After hiring Mr. Smith I felt a relief that I would not have to go this course alone, I felt I had someone who had my best interest at heart. We took this case to trial and WON, he was like a young Perry Mason. At any rate not only was I found not guilty of Domestic Battery the OP was thrown out. By the way I also hired Mr. Smith to serve this individual a 30 day notice to vacate my property. Needless to say I'm one Happy Camper with the services I received from David Smith and his team. I would Highly Recommend anyone with issues such as mine to contact Mr. Smith so that at least you will be able to breath.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.
