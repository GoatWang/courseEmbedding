Synaptive Medical Receives CE Mark in Europe and Regulatory Approval in Australia for Brightmatter Plan
Apr 24 17
Synaptive Medical Inc. has received its first CE Mark as well as regulatory approval in Australia. The approval opens European and Australian markets to BrightMatter™ Plan, a neurosurgical planning system that automatically generates dynamic tractography, enabling surgeons to easily create preoperative plans that allow for less disruptive, more accurate surgery. BrightMatter Plan is a part of Synaptive’s innovative solution that includes advanced imaging, informatics, surgical planning, navigation and robotic visualization with a digital microscope for brain surgery. BrightMatter Plan by Synaptive Medical automatically generates 3D, dynamic whole brain tractography using an advanced type of MRI called diffusion tensor imaging to provide a complete picture, representing the white matter in the brain. The software makes this unprecedented automation and level of detail clinically available for the first time. With this information, BrightMatter Plan allows surgeons to easily explore multiple approaches to determine the least invasive access point and safe route to the surgical target. This enhanced pre-surgical visualization may contribute to reduced complications, and may enable access to previously inaccessible brain locations. The resulting tractography and surgical plan can then be exported to navigation systems, such as BrightMatter Guide, for use in the operating room.

I interviewed at Synaptive Medical (Toronto, ON).InterviewOverall: satisfactoryPros:- The interviewers were polite and respectful- The interview started on time as scheduledCons:- Interview lacked structure and logical flow- Unclear objective of the interview- Interview not focused on assessing the core required skills- Although respectful and polite, the interviewers did not manage to guide the interview well. There were awkward pauses as if they didn't know what to ask next. The interview left an impression that a candidate had already been selected, and it was scheduled merely to project an equal opportunity front, which proved to be the case.Interview Questions No structured questions about previous experience.   Answer Question Synaptive Medical 2017-07-13 09:12 PDT See All 23 Interviews Synaptive Medical Awards & Accolades Let us know if we're missing any workplace or industry recognition – Add AwardsWork at Synaptive Medical?

TEWKSBURY, MA: Omnify Software, a provider of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions for electronics manufacturers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) has declared that its Empower PLM suite for product development teams will be utilized by Synaptive Medical- a developer of neurosurgical technologies and therapies.
Synaptive delivers clinically relevant, cost effective and advanced neurosurgery equipments, products and surgical visualization solutions through its expertise in automated surgical positioning systems, neurosurgical imaging, optics and information science.  Synaptive’s system generates a three dimensional roadmap of the fiber tracts within the brain’s topography through automatic data processing, enabling the neurosurgeons to plan flawless surgery and perform it with focus.
Recently, Synaptive has developed its medical device product portfolio therefore it became vital to implement an automated and integrated product development process with regulatory compliance required for a growing medical device company.
Omnify Software offers single and secure platform to manage all phases of organization’s product's life span such as concept, development, production and support, curtailing the complexity and pain of manual product design and development processes.
Omnify’s flexible and web-based Empower PLM suite can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud as well as can be integrated with organization's existing environments. It is designed to manage product content information including Item Record Data, Project Data, Quality, Automated Changes, Documents, Datasheets and Bill of Materials. It provides direct interface with CAD and CAE- design systems and ERP- manufacturing systems.
Now by deploying Empower PLM, Synaptive Medical can create tightly integrated and controlled business processes to maintain growth. Implementation and company-wide training was completed by a Synaptive team of two in less than three months.
“Omnify Software as a solution can integrate well with ERP and meet their requirements. We evaluated Omnify along with four other solutions and based on ease of integration, ease of configuration, feature list, and price, we chose Omnify Empower," says Arie Henkin, Quality Systems Lead at Synaptive Medical.
Omnify Empower is integrated into the daily life of employees at Synaptive Medical. Now employees can seamlessly find all product-related information like, raising a nonconformance in production, creating a change order in engineering and opening a corrective action in quality.
