Early life and education[edit]
Both of his parents (Richard and Judy) came from Taiwan. Tony Hsieh was born in Illinois and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area of California.[4] He has two younger brothers, Andy Hsieh and Dave Hsieh.
In 1995, he graduated from Harvard University with a degree in computer science.[5] While at Harvard, he managed the Quincy House Grille selling pizza to the students in his dorm; his best customer, Alfred Lin, would later be Zappos’s CFO and COO.[6] After college, Hsieh worked for Oracle Corporation.[7] After five months, Hsieh found himself dissatisfied with the corporate environment and quit to co-found LinkExchange with Sanjay Madan, a college friend and also an ex-Oracle employee.
Career[edit]

LinkExchange

In 1996, Hsieh started developing the idea for an advertising network called LinkExchange.[8] Members were allowed to advertise their site over LinkExchange's network by displaying banner ads on their website. They launched in March 1996, with Hsieh as CEO, and found their first 30 clients by direct emailing webmasters.[9] The site grew, and within 90 days LinkExchange had over 20,000 participating web pages and had its banner ads displayed over 10 million times.[10] By 1998, the site had over 400,000 members and 5 million ads rotated daily.[11] In November 1998, LinkExchange sold to Microsoft for $265 million.[12][13]

Venture Frogs

After LinkExchange sold to Microsoft, Hsieh co-founded Venture Frogs, an incubator and investment firm, with his business partner, Alfred Lin.[14][15] The name originated from a dare. One of Hsieh’s friends said she would invest everything if they chose "Venture Frogs" as the name, and the pair took her up on the bet (although they have yet to see any money).[16] They invested in a variety of tech and Internet startups, including Ask Jeeves, OpenTable and Zappos.[16]

Zappos

In 1999, Nick Swinmurn approached Hsieh and Lin with the idea of selling shoes online.[6] Hsieh was initially skeptical and almost deleted Swinmurn’s initial voice mail. After Swinmurn mentioned that "footwear in the US is a $40 billion market, and 5% of that was already being sold by paper mail order catalogs," Hsieh and Lin decided to invest through Venture Frogs. Two months later, Hsieh joined Zappos as the CEO, starting with $1.6 million in 2000.[6] By 2009, revenues reached $1 billion.[17][18]
On July 22, 2009, Amazon.com announced the acquisition of Zappos.com in a deal valued at approximately $1.2 billion.[19] Hsieh is said to have made at least $214 million from the sale, not including money made through his former investment firm Venture Frogs.[20] [21]

JetSuite

Hsieh joined JetSuite's board in 2011. He led a $7 million round of investment in the growing private "very light jet" concern. The investment allowed JetSuite to add two new Embraer Phenom 100 jets which have two pilots, two engines and safety features equivalent to large commercial passenger jets but weigh less than 10,000 pounds and are consequently highly fuel efficient.[22]

Twitter

Hsieh has been an active Twitter user with a substantial following. He has been widely noted as an influential figure in how Twitter can be used among C-level executives to build a connection with customers, partners and employees.[23] His public account now seems to be dormant. Since 2012, he has only sent 4 tweets from this account.[24]

Downtown Project - Las Vegas, NV

Since 2009, Hsieh, who still runs the downtown Las Vegas based Zappos.com business, has been organizing a major re-development and revitalization project for downtown Las Vegas, which has been for the most part left behind compared to the Las Vegas strip's booming growth. Hsieh originally planned the Downtown Project as a place where Zappos.com employees may live and work, but the project has grown beyond that to a vision where thousands of local tech and other entrepreneurs may live and work.[25][26] Projects funded include The Writer's Block, the first independent bookseller in Las Vegas.[27]
Awards[edit]
Hsieh received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in 2007.[28]
1993 World Champions - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest [29]
Harvard University Team - Tony Hsieh, Derrick Bass, Craig Silverstein
Personal life[edit]
In June 2010, Hsieh released Delivering Happiness, a book about his entrepreneurial endeavors. It was profiled in many world publications, including The Washington Post, CNBC, TechCrunch, The Huffington Post and The Wall Street Journal.[30][31][32][33][34] It debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List and stayed on the list for 27 consecutive weeks.[35][36] Hsieh resides primarily in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada, but he also owns a home in Southern Highlands.[37][38] [39]

Early life and education[edit]
Both of his parents (Richard and Judy) came from Taiwan. Tony Hsieh was born in Illinois and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area of California.[4] He has two younger brothers, Andy Hsieh and Dave Hsieh.
In 1995, he graduated from Harvard University with a degree in computer science.[5] While at Harvard, he managed the Quincy House Grille selling pizza to the students in his dorm; his best customer, Alfred Lin, would later be Zappos’s CFO and COO.[6] After college, Hsieh worked for Oracle Corporation.[7] After five months, Hsieh found himself dissatisfied with the corporate environment and quit to co-found LinkExchange with Sanjay Madan, a college friend and also an ex-Oracle employee.
Career[edit]

LinkExchange

In 1996, Hsieh started developing the idea for an advertising network called LinkExchange.[8] Members were allowed to advertise their site over LinkExchange's network by displaying banner ads on their website. They launched in March 1996, with Hsieh as CEO, and found their first 30 clients by direct emailing webmasters.[9] The site grew, and within 90 days LinkExchange had over 20,000 participating web pages and had its banner ads displayed over 10 million times.[10] By 1998, the site had over 400,000 members and 5 million ads rotated daily.[11] In November 1998, LinkExchange sold to Microsoft for $265 million.[12][13]

Venture Frogs

After LinkExchange sold to Microsoft, Hsieh co-founded Venture Frogs, an incubator and investment firm, with his business partner, Alfred Lin.[14][15] The name originated from a dare. One of Hsieh’s friends said she would invest everything if they chose "Venture Frogs" as the name, and the pair took her up on the bet (although they have yet to see any money).[16] They invested in a variety of tech and Internet startups, including Ask Jeeves, OpenTable and Zappos.[16]

Zappos

In 1999, Nick Swinmurn approached Hsieh and Lin with the idea of selling shoes online.[6] Hsieh was initially skeptical and almost deleted Swinmurn’s initial voice mail. After Swinmurn mentioned that "footwear in the US is a $40 billion market, and 5% of that was already being sold by paper mail order catalogs," Hsieh and Lin decided to invest through Venture Frogs. Two months later, Hsieh joined Zappos as the CEO, starting with $1.6 million in 2000.[6] By 2009, revenues reached $1 billion.[17][18]
On July 22, 2009, Amazon.com announced the acquisition of Zappos.com in a deal valued at approximately $1.2 billion.[19] Hsieh is said to have made at least $214 million from the sale, not including money made through his former investment firm Venture Frogs.[20] [21]

JetSuite

Hsieh joined JetSuite's board in 2011. He led a $7 million round of investment in the growing private "very light jet" concern. The investment allowed JetSuite to add two new Embraer Phenom 100 jets which have two pilots, two engines and safety features equivalent to large commercial passenger jets but weigh less than 10,000 pounds and are consequently highly fuel efficient.[22]

Twitter

Hsieh has been an active Twitter user with a substantial following. He has been widely noted as an influential figure in how Twitter can be used among C-level executives to build a connection with customers, partners and employees.[23] His public account now seems to be dormant. Since 2012, he has only sent 4 tweets from this account.[24]

Downtown Project - Las Vegas, NV

Since 2009, Hsieh, who still runs the downtown Las Vegas based Zappos.com business, has been organizing a major re-development and revitalization project for downtown Las Vegas, which has been for the most part left behind compared to the Las Vegas strip's booming growth. Hsieh originally planned the Downtown Project as a place where Zappos.com employees may live and work, but the project has grown beyond that to a vision where thousands of local tech and other entrepreneurs may live and work.[25][26] Projects funded include The Writer's Block, the first independent bookseller in Las Vegas.[27]
Awards[edit]
Hsieh received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in 2007.[28]
1993 World Champions - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest [29]
Harvard University Team - Tony Hsieh, Derrick Bass, Craig Silverstein
Personal life[edit]
In June 2010, Hsieh released Delivering Happiness, a book about his entrepreneurial endeavors. It was profiled in many world publications, including The Washington Post, CNBC, TechCrunch, The Huffington Post and The Wall Street Journal.[30][31][32][33][34] It debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List and stayed on the list for 27 consecutive weeks.[35][36] Hsieh resides primarily in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada, but he also owns a home in Southern Highlands.[37][38] [39]

Early life and education[edit]
Both of his parents (Richard and Judy) came from Taiwan. Tony Hsieh was born in Illinois and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area of California.[4] He has two younger brothers, Andy Hsieh and Dave Hsieh.
In 1995, he graduated from Harvard University with a degree in computer science.[5] While at Harvard, he managed the Quincy House Grille selling pizza to the students in his dorm; his best customer, Alfred Lin, would later be Zappos’s CFO and COO.[6] After college, Hsieh worked for Oracle Corporation.[7] After five months, Hsieh found himself dissatisfied with the corporate environment and quit to co-found LinkExchange with Sanjay Madan, a college friend and also an ex-Oracle employee.
Career[edit]

LinkExchange

In 1996, Hsieh started developing the idea for an advertising network called LinkExchange.[8] Members were allowed to advertise their site over LinkExchange's network by displaying banner ads on their website. They launched in March 1996, with Hsieh as CEO, and found their first 30 clients by direct emailing webmasters.[9] The site grew, and within 90 days LinkExchange had over 20,000 participating web pages and had its banner ads displayed over 10 million times.[10] By 1998, the site had over 400,000 members and 5 million ads rotated daily.[11] In November 1998, LinkExchange sold to Microsoft for $265 million.[12][13]

Venture Frogs

After LinkExchange sold to Microsoft, Hsieh co-founded Venture Frogs, an incubator and investment firm, with his business partner, Alfred Lin.[14][15] The name originated from a dare. One of Hsieh’s friends said she would invest everything if they chose "Venture Frogs" as the name, and the pair took her up on the bet (although they have yet to see any money).[16] They invested in a variety of tech and Internet startups, including Ask Jeeves, OpenTable and Zappos.[16]

Zappos

In 1999, Nick Swinmurn approached Hsieh and Lin with the idea of selling shoes online.[6] Hsieh was initially skeptical and almost deleted Swinmurn’s initial voice mail. After Swinmurn mentioned that "footwear in the US is a $40 billion market, and 5% of that was already being sold by paper mail order catalogs," Hsieh and Lin decided to invest through Venture Frogs. Two months later, Hsieh joined Zappos as the CEO, starting with $1.6 million in 2000.[6] By 2009, revenues reached $1 billion.[17][18]
On July 22, 2009, Amazon.com announced the acquisition of Zappos.com in a deal valued at approximately $1.2 billion.[19] Hsieh is said to have made at least $214 million from the sale, not including money made through his former investment firm Venture Frogs.[20] [21]

JetSuite

Hsieh joined JetSuite's board in 2011. He led a $7 million round of investment in the growing private "very light jet" concern. The investment allowed JetSuite to add two new Embraer Phenom 100 jets which have two pilots, two engines and safety features equivalent to large commercial passenger jets but weigh less than 10,000 pounds and are consequently highly fuel efficient.[22]

Twitter

Hsieh has been an active Twitter user with a substantial following. He has been widely noted as an influential figure in how Twitter can be used among C-level executives to build a connection with customers, partners and employees.[23] His public account now seems to be dormant. Since 2012, he has only sent 4 tweets from this account.[24]

Downtown Project - Las Vegas, NV

Since 2009, Hsieh, who still runs the downtown Las Vegas based Zappos.com business, has been organizing a major re-development and revitalization project for downtown Las Vegas, which has been for the most part left behind compared to the Las Vegas strip's booming growth. Hsieh originally planned the Downtown Project as a place where Zappos.com employees may live and work, but the project has grown beyond that to a vision where thousands of local tech and other entrepreneurs may live and work.[25][26] Projects funded include The Writer's Block, the first independent bookseller in Las Vegas.[27]
Awards[edit]
Hsieh received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in 2007.[28]
1993 World Champions - ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest [29]
Harvard University Team - Tony Hsieh, Derrick Bass, Craig Silverstein
Personal life[edit]
In June 2010, Hsieh released Delivering Happiness, a book about his entrepreneurial endeavors. It was profiled in many world publications, including The Washington Post, CNBC, TechCrunch, The Huffington Post and The Wall Street Journal.[30][31][32][33][34] It debuted at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List and stayed on the list for 27 consecutive weeks.[35][36] Hsieh resides primarily in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada, but he also owns a home in Southern Highlands.[37][38] [39]

 Share this article




























































DALLAS, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:    SRC) ("Spirit" or the "Company"), a premier net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that primarily invests in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate, today announced that Jackson Hsieh has been named to the position of Chief Executive Officer and President and has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, the Company announced that Richard I. Gilchrist, formerly Lead Independent Director of the Company and veteran of the REIT industry, has been appointed as Chairman of the Board. As a consequence of these changes, Thomas H. Nolan is leaving the Company effective immediately. 








"We have made significant progress at Spirit, improving the quality of our talent, strengthening our operations and enhancing our capital structure, but we recognize there is still significant work to be done," stated Mr. Hsieh. "Our plan moving forward will focus critically on credit and tenant concentration challenges in order to enhance the profitability of our platform. We remain committed to growing the Company in a manner that enables us to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve liquidity and create long-term stockholder value." 
Mr. Hsieh joined Spirit Realty Capital in September 2016 from Morgan Stanley, where he served as Managing Director and Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, primarily focused on the firm's real estate clients. Prior to this, Mr. Hsieh was Vice Chairman and Sole/Co-Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking Group at UBS, managing a team of over 70 professionals in six offices worldwide. During his career, including a prior period at Morgan Stanley and tenures at Bankers Trust Company and Salomon Brothers, Inc., he served as senior lead banker on over $285 billion of real estate and lodging transactions. Mr. Hsieh is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley (1983), and earned a master's degree from Harvard University (1987). 
Mr. Gilchrist stated, "Elevating Jackson at this critical time reflects the Board's continued focus on improving Spirit's operating capabilities. In Jackson, we have a uniquely qualified leader who has a clear vision for how we grow our Company and create the best long-term outcome for Spirit's stockholders."
In an additional move by the Board, the Company also announced that it is creating an Operating Committee to be comprised of independent directors Nicholas P. Shepherd (as chair) and Kevin M. Charlton to work closely with Mr. Hsieh and members of his senior team. The committee has the authority to retain advisors.  
Commenting on the Operating Committee, Mr. Gilchrist said, "By adding this new committee, the Board can provide practical support and assistance to Jackson as he transitions into his new role and starts the work of executing the Company's growth plan, while also strengthening Board oversight and interaction with management." 
The Board of Directors has also determined to reschedule the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, originally scheduled for May 11, 2017, until a later date, currently expected to be by the end of June 2017. The Company will reschedule the meeting to circulate revised proxy materials reflecting the management changes described in this press release. In due course, the Company will submit a revised proxy statement to the stockholders, including a notice setting forth the date, time and location of the rescheduled Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The record date for holders entitled to vote at the meeting of the close of business on March 17, 2017 will remain unchanged.
