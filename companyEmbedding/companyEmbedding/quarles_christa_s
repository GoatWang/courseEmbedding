SaveHere’s the scenario: Management starts to lose control over a company’s work. Teams are operating without full context or feedback loops. Product becomes highly reactive. HR’s busy and top performers are looking to jump ship. Those who stay start to complain about the lack of direction.  Nearly all technology companies — from small startups to big successes — have experienced at least one of these symptoms.Take it from OpenTable CEO Christa Quarles. Over her career, she’s become virtually clairvoyant when it comes to identifying when, how and where companies are about to break — and early enough to save the day. Without question, Quarles comes from resilient stock. She grew up with six siblings, her husband’s a former Navy Seal, and four months after joining OpenTable as its CFO, she was named interim CEO and elevated to permanent CEO two months later.In this interview, Quarles draws from a rich career across industries to share her war stories and hard-earned wisdom about how startups can survive their breaking points. She offers three strategies to fortify companies for change, and charts four key areas to monitor for fissures during growth: headcount, revenue, users and geographic expansion. With her predictive acumen and figurative duct tape at the ready, Quarles may be your company’s Nostradamus meets MacGyver.Three Principles To Reinforce Your CompanyFrom the vantage point of the C-suite across four companies in six years, Quarles has become an expert at picking out the sweet and weak spots in companies as they scale. Through recognizing those patterns, she has honed her approach to leading a company during dynamic and uncertain times. Here are the three pillars of her philosophy:Reactively lean-in.Most startups either proactively establish process (like standing meetings, systems, protocols) to support fast growth or push until something breaks and then assess if it’s worth fixing. Instead of swinging to either end of the spectrum, Quarles champions reactively leaning-in, which requires continuous calibration.“If you try to put in a lot of process before any pain is felt, there won’t be the urgency to do anything. And you’ll drive away your engineers, who especially hate banal processes,” says Quarles. “So you have to watch for the little cracks and nudges before the big hammer hits you over the head. Post mortem why things happen. Don’t write off edge cases as one-time exceptions. They are there to teach you and should make your antennae go up.”To strike the balance, seek better context on the current situation, not preemptive ways to change it. The former is a contribution, while the latter is inevitably about control. “At Playdom, we treated our LTV [life-time value] calculations like they were gospel. Driving new users through advertising was a big part of our business and we were spending a lot of money doing it,” says Quarles. “At times, I had my doubts. As CFO, I had the benefit of hindsight on the ad spend as I could see the near-term ROI calculations and look back on the financials for the past quarter. If it didn’t add up, I could push on the teams through simple, side calculations that uncovered issues with how we calculated the viral coefficient for new users. That way we were quick to make refinements, without blindly pushing wholesale changes that’d shock the system.”Work toward — and be affirmed by — problems.The success and survival statistics of startups are referenced often, but, according to Quarles, more attention should be paid to how often companies temporarily break, not completely fail. When a company — or anything — breaks, there’s an interplay of counteractive forces, and related movement, tension and traction. There’s an opportunity to re-channel or redirect energy. Failures become one-directional and are characterized by stagnancy more than dynamism.To grow, you must break. Like a snake shedding its skin.“Get comfortable with breakages —  it’s part of the process. They’re footholds, not pitfalls,” says Quarles. “Build systems around them, so that you’re prepared to identify their origin, learn from and repair them. Then, the breakages won’t seem so scary or dramatic. They’re signals that you’re ready to take on something that, up until this moment, you weren’t able to handle.”Take when to introduce basic HR (T&E policies, employee handbook and systems) at a startup. “Early on at Playdom, we were keeping all of our employee information in spreadsheets. We didn't have an HRIS [Human Resources Information System]. We didn't have policies,” says Quarles. “But as we grew to 175 to 200 people, this process started to become unwieldy. We didn't have salary histories. We started seeing T&E costs grow faster than it should given the employee growth. Incorrect information flowed into payroll. All of these things are symptoms of your system are breaking down. It’s means growth, but also the need for a new approach.”Establish a clear line between the finder and fixer.In Quarles’ experience, it is rarely the person who spots the breakage who fixes it. “Often it is the folks who are in jobs with a horizontal purview — such as finance, HR or the CEO — who can and should spot fissures,” she says. “A CEO may have to dive in (depending on the size of the company) and outline the problem for teams, but ultimately the groups where the breakage is happening should be the ones to fix it. Chances are teams won’t get it right the first time, so watch and iterate. Post-mortem the tiny breaks and try a little process to offset the problem.”Quarles illustrates this point with her account of Playdom’s users and their LTV. She was leading Finance, but was able to spot a material issue with how the startup spent its marketing dollars. Companies can even take steps to narrow the gap between “the finder” and the “the fixer” of a breakage. “At Nextdoor, our BI [Business Intelligence] team would find anomalies in the data, which could mean that the damage was already done inside the product,” says  Quarles. “As a result, we set up dashboards for the relevant product teams so they could be on the front lines to see things break. By democratizing the data and sharing the analysis, the these teams could catch their errors as they rolled out new features, instead of waiting for them to show up in the top line metrics.”Know Your Company’s Fault LinesFor startups equipped with Quarles’ three principles around company breakages, here are the four areas to keep a close eye on for cracks. Because no two companies experience growth the same way, Quarles has discovered that asking the right questions periodically is the tactic, rather than prescribing generalized solutions. So, interlaced with examples and tips, she highlights key questions that leaders — and their teams — should ask themselves to stress test their organizations.HEADCOUNTWhile at Playdom, an online social network game developer, Quarles saw the company through a $760 million acquisition by Disney, but not before she helped the startup buy and integrate seven companies — at an approximate clip of one acquisition per month.One Monday morning, Quarles took stock. It was the first day for 30 new hires. And over the preceding six months, the startup had onboarded 500 new people. This rapid growth splintered their HR processes, finance systems and engineering org chart. Quarles has learned to ask the following three questions to identify any chinks in the armor due to ballooning employee growth.What percentage of first-time managers are in action?As companies in hyper-growth add headcount, it’s common to elevate individual contributors to leadership positions. While internal promotions come with cultural fit and invaluable institutional knowledge, they may not yet be equipped to see around corners as managers.“I can’t tell you how often I’ve seen new hires pour into a company and an overwhelmed leadership internally promotes by pedigree, elevating the Stanford grad with a PhD in CS over onboarding a seasoned manager,” says Quarles. “Now imagine that happening weekly for a year. It’s a perfect storm: a promoted, star individual contributor who’s a rookie in the role and the leader who’s forgotten the difficulties of becoming a decent manager at the start.”A concrete way to gauge potential breaking points as a team doubles, triples and quintuples is to monitor the number of active first-time managers (who are less than a year into the role). If that number is roughly 30% of total management, take pause and ask the following questions to determine if you’ve trained your contingent of green leaders sufficiently: Is it easy to clearly outline how we delegate and escalate key decision making? Are managers having 1:1s with their people? Are they giving feedback back to their reports on their progress? Are new managers’ reports happy in their work? Do new managers have people they can turn to as a lifeline?If you don’t like the answers, assign people and activate processes to create checks and balances, before a big break happens. “For example, we once made a rule that disallowed adding more than 3 reports to a new manager without adding support. It could be formal management training or pairing the new manager with a seasoned counterpart. They’re used to being top contributors; they need a safe forum or confidant to ask the ‘dumb’ questions.”How quickly do managers get back to you with status updates?Another early warning sign is the inability of managers to quickly summarize the status of their work. “If there are blank stares, it doesn’t necessarily reflect the capability of the manager, but perhaps the complexity and velocity of the challenges they’re facing,” she says. “The solution is not to make them do more busywork reporting, but to investigate why they’re having a hard time pinpointing their location on the map.”Throughout her career, Quarles has found that when her reports don’t have answers to simple questions, it wouldn’t be long until the wheels fell off the wagon. In one instance, she noticed that features of the company’s website stopped functioning. The short term solution was fixing the code, but the underlying trouble was in the Q&A process. She knew that because her engineering managers couldn’t answer where the release was in the approval process.“If managers cannot tell you in an instant where they stand on a goal, it’s best to re-visit and retrofit your team’s objectives. Perhaps they’ve outpaced them or haven’t set them in the first place,” says Quarles. “Regardless of the reason, if it takes them a week to get back to you on a goal, then they probably aren’t monitoring what that goal is. They're not necessarily in charge of what their group is actually working on in that point in time. That’s the time to step in.”How monocultural is human resources?When Disney acquired Playdom, Quarles knew to zero-in on one specific department: human resources. Attention is more often given to how engineering or product management teams integrate. Yet, during hyper-growth and milestone mergers, Quarles likes to gauge the integrity of the team that’s logistically defining how a company’s people are brought together.“People like to talk about the fabric of a company as if it’s one material. But in moments of rapid growth — whether organic or via acquisition — it’s undoubtedly quilt work. That requires hands that assemble in unison,” says Quarles. “Imagine a 90 year-old media company under the same rules as a high-paced, frenetic gaming-as-a-service startup. The latter, Playdom, had almost no process, while the former, Disney, expertly coordinates 100,000 employees during peak amusement park season — in just one corner of its operations. More often than not, HR is a reliable and representative microcosm for companies’ cultures at any point in time.”So, when the media behemoth and gaming startup came under the same roof, Quarles stepped in as translator, until they became comfortable and conversant with the other. “During change and fast growth, HR should be one of the first places to be unified by the same cultural mores and procedural philosophies. In this case, it meant adopting some structure from Disney and keeping some flexibility for Playdom, until they both saw their individual identities represented and then melded together. That unified front was critical to the health of a growing team.”Frequently conduct litmus tests to spot the breaking points in your company, especially when it’s scaling quickly. Growth covers a lot of sins.Acquisitions aside, rapidly growing companies can lean on a few techniques to keep its HR strong and singular. Quarles has worked at startups that scaled to over a hundred people before instituting “real HR” — that’s just too late. Here are a few places to monitor during fast growth: Compensation: “If 30-40% of your employee base is over two years vested, it's probably time to look at stock grants.” Annual reviews: “Do you have them? You can keep it informal and simple, but not giving star performers feedback on their performance isn't a good idea. People want to know they're having impact. If you don’t have a formal performance review cycle, lean on or bring in some seasoned managers. It’s harder for first-time managers to navigate.” Unfiltered feedback: “An exec at a fast-scaling startup will stop getting the straight scoop from her team. Much will be sugar-coated. More people means more politics. Try to keep your truth-tellers. If you can’t, create mechanisms for anonymous feedback.”REVENUEHaving held the post of CFO at several companies, Quarles typically has the strongest command of a company’s financial health and potential in the boardroom. Compared to increased hiring or skyrocketing user growth, breakages along the financial vector often occur due to the overwhelming absence of revenue. Here are the two key questions she keeps in mind regarding revenue to weatherproof for breakages:What’s different about how the company’s investing in its growth versus in the past?When Quarles started at OpenTable, the company had been acquired for about a year, public for six years and in business for 17 years. Long past were the days when it brought restaurants online by installing cable to show the value of its web-based reservation service. Today, OpenTable doesn’t need to invest in connectivity; the catalyst for growth has changed.“The path of how you once grew will be fundamentally different from the way you now need to scale. That’s especially true for startups who should be testing and confirming their path to growth about every two years. Don’t get your horizon stuck at the next quarter, but think deeply about where your think your current growth strategy will land you,” says Quarles. “Right now, for OpenTable our growth comes from market adjacencies like casual dining and entering new geographic markets — both organically and through acquisition as we did in the UK and, most recently, in Australia. Our benchmark has largely been the US, and within that, specific markets.”Don’t be afraid to look cross-industry for inspiration on how companies have sparked growth and avoided top-line atrophying. For example, one way Uber chose its target cities for expansion was by monitoring where its customers opened its app in regions where it didn’t operate. “We’ve employed the same tactic by analyzing requests from OpenTable users and have started to evaluate their top searches on the platform in regions where we don’t operate. If they’ve booked before, we know that they’re familiar with the type of restaurants on the site. When we noticed that they were searching for casual, chain restaurants versus one-location eateries, we knew to take a closer look and change tacks to fulfill that need.”Learn to call audibles. An above-average read of your environment is better than sticking to a perfectly drawn-up play — even if that plan once brought success.Are there limitations to the network effect?Around 12 years into OpenTable’s operation, network revenue surpassed subscription revenue for the first time. This was a milestone for a business that, for many years, was almost entirely subscription-based because there was little to no network of restaurants. Since 2010, OpenTable’s revenues have been increasingly — and very heavily — composed of network revenue. “The trade-off between subscription which is fixed and network revenue which is variable has made for a very dynamic evolution,” says Quarles.As the network became more powerful, OpenTable needed to take a more nuanced approach with its pricing strategy. “We weren’t matching price and value or giving restaurants a way to spend more to get more. We needed to take the simplicity of $1 per diner, which served the company well in its past and look at a different solution for different states of equilibrium in our marketplace,” says Quarles. “Some restaurants have too many diners and too much demand. As such, we’re testing paid reservations in New York with the very popular restaurant Cosme. On the other hand, some restaurants have too few diners. For those, we are focused on how OpenTable can the marketing mechanism and demand-generating engine for these restaurants.”OpenTable CEO Christa QuarlesGEOGRAPHIC EXPANSIONGiven its broad network of restaurants, OpenTable is a geographically-defined business. More restaurants mean more revenue, but also more diversity in customer behavior. For example, what works for patrons in Nashville doesn’t work for diners in New York. If OpenTable expands with its product in a regionally agnostic way, fissures will form and start to weaken the business.“Our research showed that our Nashville diners were eating out twice as often as they reserved on OpenTable. So, if they dined ten times a year at restaurants after making OpenTable reservations, they were actually eating out around 20 times annually,” says Quarles. “Through talking with customers and looking at restaurant inventory, we realized that we had an issue with our supply. The restaurants that we offered were the ones booked for special occasions, like an anniversary or birthday.  We started to add more casual dining restaurants that are primarily walk-in, but accept reservations.”The bottom line: repurpose your best use case as an initial comparison, not a template. For OpenTable, that means juxtaposing its American cities with its first municipal market, San Francisco. Or, if taking a broader regional analysis, by comparing the US market with the European market. “The exercise is to compare, not replicate,” says Quarles. “The starting point, development and solution for that market will not be the same. But it will accelerate the path to unveil that market’s levers, economics and cultural peculiarities."Here are the follow-up questions to ask around geographic expansion to prevent any breakages across time zones: How exportable is the product? Have you built your product to be ready made for new languages? “OpenTable has learned this lesson the hard way. It didn't originally build its product to be global; multi-lingual capabilities weren’t a part of the initial product roadmap. It’s difficult to adapt our architecture for other markets, but we are doing it,” says Quarles. “If you're doing construction and the walls are all opened up, it's much easier to put the outlet in the wall. You don't have to plug in the lamp just yet, but have the outlet there when the house is being built. Same goes for international. A little forethought into your product architecture can save pain down the road.” Can you configure your product easily for cultural differences? “In America, we list breakfast, lunch and dinner, but in Australia, people reserve for breakfast, lunch, teatime and dinner,” says Quarles. “All of a sudden, there’s an entirely new category of dining experience. On the back-end, it was an easy fix, but was important to provide restaurants with this capability as it matched their hospitality style.” Also, OpenTable has discovered a spike in reservations from restaurants offering deals in both the UK, so it has started to pilot specific offer-based products in select markets that it plans to take globally. Does your business require payments, what is different about how you will make revenue as a result? “Germany's the classic example. They don't use credit cards and so, show different behavior in how they would like to pay,” Quarles says. “So, it was important for us to consider that preference, before setting up an identification and reservations system centered around credit cards.”The buildings that stay up during earthquakes are designed to move with the vibrations, not outfitted to resist them. Learn to tango with the tremors.USERSWhen the number of active users goes through the roof, it’s cause for celebration only if the growth can be corralled. Quarles has been inured to breakage by user growth due to her background in the gaming industry. “Most fissures form from technological scale. We would see significant spikes around product launches and could see step-function breakages at users thresholds that hadn’t been previously been hit,” she says. “We would ensure we had surge capacity on AWS [Amazon Web Services]. But that’s a short term fix. And it’s also dangerous to buy the 747 when all you need is a nimble biplane. You can ‘over invest’ without knowing exactly what you need causing waste as well. It’s a tricky balance.”The best policy is to take small steps to build the system to scale. Quarles starts by asking these questions:What are the edge cases with users and how can we get to them faster?Quarles admits that it’s difficult to extract general tactics around users, given how distinct and disparate their behavior can be between — or even within — industries. “My friends at [mobile gaming and entertainment network] Scopely recently showed me a game that got 4 million downloads in a week. It reminded me how dynamic user growth can be in the gaming space,” says Quarles. “ At Playdom, we’d monitor Daily Active Users (DAUs). We had a couple of games that'd hit one million DAUs. Then five million DAUs. And boom. Every time, we’d hit 5 million more DAUs something would break.”There’s internal (e.g. sandbox-testing) and external (beta testing) exercises to run, but there’s not always a way to replicate five, ten or 20 millions active users on your app or game at once. “The real time nature of gaming makes it more complicated when more people are added to the system. Even e-commerce flows are much more straightforward,” says Quarles. “Once, one of our engineers coded the leaderboard so that it was updated in real time. But when 10 million active users were on, it crashed the entire game.”While no amount of testing helped Playdom pinpoint the breakage at 5 or 10 million users, it helped them write and fine-tune a game plan for further breakages at scale after the fact. “Yes, success meant millions of active users, but it also was finding the tipping-point that brought it all down. If you start with the premise that it will inevitably break at some point, you learn to quickly speed toward the breaking points, so you can be on hand and prepared to better fix them.”Skilled drivers know that the most controlled way to take a curve at high speed is to accelerate through it. And so it goes with testing for breakages during rapid user growth.Are there dedicated eyes on analytics around launches and releases?Given that no amount of testing will prevent breakages from user growth, Quarles champions continuous monitoring of user activity. Depending on a company’s resources, the responsibility may be concentrated in a role or shared across the broader team.“At Playdom, I felt that we had a good system in place. We used home-grown analytics, which everybody had access to at their desk,” says Quarles. “It was mostly in real-time and so any team member could send out an alert if output mechanisms started to look funny. It helped us to identify and fix any issues — typically within an hour. That made our reactions feel more proactive. It beat apologizing to users saying, ‘Oops, it broke.’”For key launches, it’s wise to build an analytics bunker and staff it with a team to monitor activity before, during and after a big release. “For notable launches, we’d have engineers on hand, each assigned to monitor a metric. It was a bit of a war-room mentality, but very rarely did things break — and not for long, if they did — when we organized ourselves in that way,” says Quarles. “We take the same approach at OpenTable. Inevitably, every Mother's Day the system gets taxed and something breaks. This year, we had all teams on watch and nothing got too overheated. The day passed without incident and set a new record for the holiday.”The TakeawayWhen Quarles asks a company when it last broke, she’s not digging for vulnerability, but searching for accounts of strength. She gets concerned when she sees a company that has been around for decades that hasn’t experienced a breakage due to hiring sprees, dried up growth strategies, market expansion or extreme user gain or churn. There’s no foolproof plan to keep fissures from eventually shattering your company, but you can almost guarantee extinction if aren’t preparing for — and getting affirmation from — a breakage in your company.“It can literally be your company’s big break. And importantly it’s a chance to entrust and embolden your people,” says Quarles.  “They shouldn’t see a breakage as a failure, but as an eventuality during which everyone steps up as custodians of their corner of the company. As a leader, it’s your job to ask these questions before a breakage, so that your people are not only prepared for it, but also looking forward to the new growth it’ll bring.”Recommended ArticlesFirst Round TalentAccess exclusive opportunities at the startups

OpenTable's New CEO Talks Digital Payments and Premium Reservations | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchCEO DailyCEO Daily: Friday, 28th JulyFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28OpenTable's CEO Christa Quarles Eric Millette © 2015 Eric Millette, All Rights reservedMobile PaymentsOpenTable’s New CEO Talks Mobile Payments, Premium Reservations, and MoreLeena RaoApr 01, 2016OpenTable is one of the few Web 1.0 companies that has managed to survive while fending off dozens of competitors and several waves of panic in the internet world. The 18-year-old restaurant booking giant went public in 2009, only to be acquired five years later by travel booking juggernaut Priceline for $2.6 billion, marking Priceline's largest acquisition to date.Now, OpenTable says it seats more than 18 million diners per month via online bookings across more than 36,000 restaurants. In November, OpenTable named Christa Quarles as its permanent CEO after she served as interim CEO as well as chief financial officer before that.Quarles, a former executive at Disney and the neighborhoods-centric social network Nextdoor, is ushering in OpenTable into mobile payments, personalized recommendations, premium reservations, and more. Fortune sat down with Quarles to hear more about her plans.Fortune: Can you share more about what you are working on at OpenTable right now?Christa Quarles: We want to empower great dining experiences, meaning before, during and after their experience at a restaurant. Before is about reshaping how diners discover restaurants. During the dining experience, we will continue to innovate on our how we allow diners to use OpenTable to pay for their bills. We continue to believe that mobile payments is somewhat early, but we want to be there. We all have the uberization of the restaurant experience in our head and what it should feel like. After the dining experience, it’s about changing what our review structure looks like. We currently have 35 million dining reviews; there's a lot that we can do that we hadn't necessarily been doing.RelatedFortune 500Meg Whitman Says She’s Not Heading to UberFortune 500Meg Whitman Says She’s Not Heading to UberWe are also focused on helping restaurants drive and grow their businesses. And lastly, one of the biggest things we’ve discovered being a part of Priceline is taking the global traveler and converting them into becoming the global diner. So you're in any city or market around the world, and we want you to be able to pull out your phone, and say, "Hey, I'm in Tokyo." "Hey, I'm in Berlin," and "I need to go up to dine tonight and how can OpenTable help me?”And that's the piece we really haven't spent as much time talking about, and nor have we really articulated, frankly, the benefit from being part of the Priceline group. Google just did this pretty exhaustive survey of travelers for their traveler marketers, and they looked at what's the number one activity that travelers want to do in market. First is dining, second is attractions. And so, when you think about being in New York instead of going to the Empire State Building or Central Park, they want to go to a hot restaurant in New York, and that's sort of the way that travelers nowadays want to understand and enjoy the culture.What are new ways you are trying to help diners discover restaurants on OpenTable?One of the things that we're working on is really this idea of creating the ultimate recommendations engine for restaurants and dining. So, we've all experienced that moment where you wanted to go to a particular restaurant, and you couldn't get into that particular restaurant. And so one of the things that we can do is to create a recommendations engine, looking at things like menu data, prices, cuisine type, specific trendiness, and location to recommend similar places based on people’s individual preferences.Another area where we can make smarter recommendations is if I am in a market that I am visiting. So if I am a traveler going to Europe, how do I find restaurants catered towards my preferences and experiences?I think with mobile, getting restaurants near me is super helpful but also giving our users more ways to discover restaurants is important too.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.What about payments? Is OpenTable’s payments service growing?We are. And the thing that's important for payments is that it’s a two-sided marketplace. So it's about both getting the restaurants to be in a position to accept payments, and then getting the diner to opt in. One of the things that we've found is that it’s easier to get the diner to opt in at the time of the reservation. Because the whole point of OpenTable Payments is take out the moment at the end of meal, where you are asking, "What's the damage? What's the bill?"We're really focusing in on a couple of markets, but we believe we are early in the mobile payments evolution. I think when we look out a couple of years, we'll be really glad that we have made that investment.How many active users do you guys have now?The way we look at it is the number of connections that we make, and so last year we made nearly a quarter of a billion reservations across our platform. Since the start of OpenTable, we have made over a billion reservations.For more on big data, watch:Where are the areas you think future growth is going to come from?Going global is big. Right now, we are in eight countries officially, and what we haven't done is really harness this traveler connection. We haven't marketed the concept of being able to book globally everywhere. People are doing it naturally, but I think we can do a lot better job of making it much easier for people to find the restaurants that they're looking to go to.And what does experience need to look like?So the thing that I always go back to is the first thing you do when you go in to check into a hotel; the first question you go to ask the concierge is, "Where will we go to dinner tonight?" And you shouldn't have to do that. We should both know that you're in the hotel and that you're in a new market and here is a recommendation, and there's a lot of signal that can be given from the hotel that you're staying at.So, if you can imagine that you're staying in a luxury hotel in the swanky part of town, you probably have a certain kind of expectation for the dinner. When you check into your hotel, we should give you five recommendations that are within walking distance that are going to fit the parameters that we would guess would be interesting to you. We would start pushing marketing messages to the diner based on your location and preferences.What are other ways you are trying to improve the experience for the diner?We are making sure that we can get reviews in the system. For example, we are working with Instagram to pull in photos from restaurants into the system. We did our first test in Atlanta. We pulled in 75,000 Instagram photos, and then we used data science to remove all the selfies and photos that didn’t include the food and restaurant.These photos then show up in the restaurant’s OpenTable profile and help people figure out what to eat.What other partnerships are instrumental to OpenTable’s growth?I think Google is probably the biggest and most obvious partner. If you type in the name and restaurant in the the search box, there will be a button in the box that says "Make a Reservation," and it goes right into OpenTable.There's definitely no shortage of competitors that are coming after OpenTable. How do you view the competition?Food and tech has been a really exciting new venture market. The way I look at it is a lot of what we see in the competition are features of things that we're doing. And so I think that some of the things we see out there are absolutely appropriate for a subset of our restaurants.We're testing things like Premium Reservations in New York right now. You can pay money to have a reservation. This is not going to work for every restauranteur. In fact, Danny Meyer has said things like he doesn't want that hospitality model for his restaurants, but for other restaurants it works.We’re saying, let's be in a position to have the restaurant make money from their popularity from it. And so we think there's a really cool opportunity to expand on what I call the hot restaurant product. But then there's also the other end of the spectrum, which is restaurants who have too few diners, and what's interesting there is even the hot restaurants sometimes don't have enough diners at Tuesday at 5:30. So there's peak periods of supply and demand, and so we're spending a ton of time looking at this concept of how do I pay more to get more? I always call it around here the mythical "Need Diners Button."We're looking and experimenting with a lot of these kind of marketplace dynamics and tools to help drive new diners into different experiences.What’s the biggest challenge for OpenTable?The biggest thing for me is really making sure that I get all the people that I need to help drive this business. I've been the CEO for seven months, and I realize I can't do it all myself.At the end of the day, I actually think our biggest challenge is just getting in our own way. Not moving fast enough, not going fast enough. I think as we go global, there are some competitors in different markets.I think Google is always sort of a friend and a foe. We're always watching. We love what Google does, but we've seen Google do different things over the years. But I don't believe we're going to see Google putting software in restaurants anytime soon.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

This interview with Christa Quarles, chief executive of OpenTable, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. Tell me about your early years.A. I’m the sixth of seven kids, and we lived outside Pittsburgh. Mom was originally a schoolteacher, but then stayed at home to raise seven kids. Dad was an engineer at U.S. Steel. For me, as the sixth, there were no firsts left for me to accomplish, both good and bad. It had all happened before I came about. One of the big challenges for me was, “How do I stand out? How do I even get noticed in this giant family?”My mom appreciated humor, though, so I learned that a quick wit was a way to get noticed. I also felt like I had to do something more or succeed exceptionally to make it even matter, because everybody in my family was expected to get all A’s and go to college.I’ve interviewed so many C.E.O.s over the years who come from large families.You certainly learn to be comfortable with a fair amount of chaos. There’s always something getting thrown at you and you just learn to become like Teflon. I always felt, bring it on. Continue reading the main story

My parents were also fascinated by psychology, and they did marriage counseling for our church. So we were always getting psychology tests growing up because I think they were also fascinated by how seven kids could be so different. So I was an early student of psychology, because they were always giving us the latest test. There was just an interest in the family around the questions of why you behave the way you do and why you think the way you do.Do you see strands of your parents’ influence in the way you lead today?A little bit, but slightly more with my older siblings. I gained some wisdom early on just by watching what worked for my older siblings, what didn’t work, watching their failures.There are three kinds of people — the people who never learn from mistakes, the people who learn from their own mistakes and the people who learn from other people’s mistakes. I put myself in that last category because I had all these examples before me, and I never felt like I had to fail as often because there was so much I could learn from. People have always called me an old soul, and it was just more that I had lots of examples in front of me.Early leadership lessons for you?The first time I had to fire someone whom I had specifically hired, I was truly sick to my stomach. I fought the idea for a long time, and thought I could mitigate the problem.And then you start realizing it’s actually better for that person too. The kind thing is saying that you’re not going to be successful here for these reasons, and you want that person to find their better path.

I’ve had to terminate lots of different kinds of people in different roles, and I would say that the minute you know it’s not right should be the minute you do it. And you never regret doing it too soon. You always regret waiting too long. When somebody’s not right, there is addition by subtraction sometimes.

Other lessons?The importance of embracing vulnerability. Early on, especially when I worked on Wall Street, God forbid that you declare any granular weakness, because people would pounce on it.But the paradox of owning what you know and what you don’t know is that you actually seem more powerful as you expose more vulnerability. I’ve become more comfortable with exposing my vulnerability and not being afraid to go there.When I give criticism now, I’ll talk about how I failed in a similar situation. I try to humanize the criticism in a way that says this is about an action, it’s not about you as a person. I want to make you better. If somebody feels like they’re in a safe place and they can hear the message, they’re more likely to change.This is your first C.E.O. role. Any surprises?The thing that’s always surprising to me, because I’m such an open, candid, frank person, is how my words can carry 10 times the weight they used to. I don’t want to lose that authenticity, so I am still kind of unvarnished most of the time. But I realize that some people are going to go off and actually build a product feature because I said something in a meeting. So I do follow up afterward to make sure we are all on the same page.The other surprise was that people were afraid to share things early on. Teams were trying to perfect something before they would show it to me, and they’d waste a ton of time trying to get it to be perfect to show to the C.E.O. So I said, “Early, often, ugly. It’s O.K. It doesn’t have to be perfect because then I can course-correct much, much faster.” No amount of ugly truth scares me. It’s just information to make a decision.How do you hire?I don’t always have a specific set of questions, but I am looking for whether your eyes light up when you’re talking about 80 percent of what the job requires. And I always ask, “What kind of work do you avoid doing?” Because there’s always a part of your job that everybody hates. I want to understand what part that is, and I also want to understand what makes your eyes light up. The person who enjoys their job is going to give you 20 times the effort.What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?It’s about finding your space and not being afraid to shift around to find that thing that truly brings you joy. I don’t think there’s any shame in changing jobs, especially early on, to find that groove. But then once you’ve found it, you really have to put in the time to become an expert in that thing.

Rascoff: Thanks Christa for doing this.
Quarles: Thanks for having me.
Rascoff: So you had this really fascinating career on Wall Street. I think 10 years on Wall Street, right, and then moved into gaming at Playdom, which sold to Disney, and then of course you were an exec at Disney, and then Next Door. And then you got this call probably a little more than a year ago and the call to become a first-time CEO, a CEO of this amazing company and product which I love, OpenTable. So the question is what was it like the night – that night before, the night before it got announced, the night before you were presented to your new employees? What were you thinking about? What were you nervous about? What was going through your head?
Quarles: Well, I had a little bit of an interim step in there. So I joined OpenTable as the CFO, knowing that the CEO succession path was in there, but the day I got the call for the interim CEO job was a little interesting because we had talked about succession. But I was thinking a year or two, not three months, and so that was the first interesting call that I got. And as my yoga instructor says, “What’s the alternative to breathing?” And so we had a little bit of time in the interim chair, but I think becoming officially in the role and then really driving the organization forward, I think OpenTable’s an amazing company and really being in position to take it to that next level of growth, that next set of opportunities in front of it. I’m very lucky that I got to benefit from all those years behind me where there’s a two-sided marketplace. It was scaled, but there was all these opportunities that were still in front of it and really take it from here to there.
Rascoff: Did you have establish your bonafides with the product people, with engineers, designers, PMs, etc., who thought of you as a finance person, a CFO, not a product person?
Quarles: Yeah and it was a little bit of  baptism by fire because I ended up taking on the head of product role, about 28 days after I started so I just kind of –
Rascoff: While you were still CFO or when you became CEO?
Quarles: CEO, yeah, CEO. So I decided to make some changes in the organization and so I took on the head of product role. So actually at that time, I was still CFO, CEO, and head of product. Nothing like a challenge and thankfully the background in gaming was extraordinarily helpful because it’s like product development on crack because you’re constantly – I think when I was at Disney and Playdom, we probably launched 40 or 50 products at that point and had gone through the rapid iteration cycle, something that succeeded, and something that failed. So it was both lots and lots of product failure and lots of product success, but then lots of product launches. And so I had just so many iterations and so the beauty of gaming being a hit driven industry is that there’s lots of failure to teach you.
Rascoff: And so OpenTable is, by internet standards, ancient, right?
Quarles: Yes.
Rascoff: I think it was started in 1998, in the early days of the internet ,and so it’s quite different than a traditional startup in that sense, in the sense that the product is more mature. It’s been more fully built out, but you have a vision for where it’s going to go. So describe what will OpenTable be like in 5 or 10 years.
Quarles: Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. We were started in an era when there’s literally cabling being introduced inside the restaurant because Wi-Fi didn’t exist. The notion of a mobile phone wasn’t even on – flown certainly, but the computer in your pocket certainly not a thing. And what’s interesting is we kind of lucked out in some ways because we are the perfect marriage between technology and the physical world, so we are a very local business. We are in almost 40,000 restaurants around the world right now.
Rascoff: With really strong local network effects, right?
Quarles: Yeah and so we kind of benefitted because we really got into what I would consider the third wave of – the first wave was really all about the internet and that abstraction from location, and then it was 10 blue links on Google, and now it’s like, OK, how to mobile and that mobile world and take advantage of that. And then when I look beyond, it is thinking about a world where AI machine learning are driving things and very much creating that ultimate restaurant recommendation. For us, where does it look like in 5 years? I think first of all, we are a much more global company today even though we’re in eight countries around the world and technically have restaurants in about 75 countries. We’re still fairly well known in the United States and North America, but not as much outside the world. We’re now part of the largest travel company in the world in the form of Priceline, and we believe that we should be everywhere. We talk about the idea of a global dining passport. You wake up in Berlin, Dubai, Melbourne, and Tokyo. You should be able to have a curated mobile dining experience presented to you where you – then you can create a booking or you can go into a walk in and waitlist restaurant. That’s the other side of our opportunity, which is looking at market adjacencies, not just fine dining reservation taking, but truly broadening the aperture to look at casual opportunities as well to get a bigger chunk of our – of the dining experiences for our customers.
Rascoff: In terms of your leadership style, especially early on when you first took on the CEO role, is it different being a CEO?  Do you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders? And I know I sometimes do, so maybe I’m just trying to project here [laughs].
Quarles: Well, it’s a tightrope every day in the sense that you’re always trying to – I literally have the last member of the team coming on board in the next two weeks, over the last year that I’ve been trying to put in place. You’re always looking at do I have the right team? Are they performing where they need to? Making sure that –
Rascoff: So one of the first things you had to do was rebuild your team of directs?
Quarles: Right, exactly.
Rascoff: And you kind of rebooted the exec leadership team here.
Quarles: That’s right, and there were some great folks and – but by being 18 years old, you end up having a lot of tenure and trying to figure out what’s the right mix for where we want to go versus where we’ve been. And so just getting that team in place and always kind of surveying the landscape and saying OK, that’s good for maybe where we need right now, but where we’re going, I might need somebody else. And so that was definitely a critical component. I think that certainly the surprise is just how much every single word is held onto, deconstructed, interpreted, and I’m a really honest, candid, open person and so I kind of put – wear everything on my sleeve. And so making sure then I characterize, “Oh, this is a direction. This is just my opinion.” This is just me in the kitchen just asking, “Oh, what about this?  What about this?” And so making sure people understand where – what is really my driving motivation because I want to maintain that authenticity and those candid conversations, but I have to be clear and people need to know when it’s not an option.
Rascoff: Who’s talking? I do that a lot. I say like, this is – I’m not saying this as CEO. I’m just saying this as a user. Here’s a little product feedback. It doesn’t mean you have to go and prioritize this bug to the top of your list. It just means that I’m filing a bug. Approximately how many employees work at OpenTable?
Quarles: We’re about 1,000 employees.
Rascoff: OK, and you’re part of Priceline Group which is tens of thousands of employees.
Quarles: Sixteen thousand.
Rascoff: Sixteen thousand employees.
Quarles: I think. Somewhere in there.
Rascoff: Do most people that show up for work at OpenTable, do they feel that they work at OpenTable or they work at Priceline Group?
Quarles: They definitely feel like they work at OpenTable. The beauty of the structure of the Priceline Group is we are incredibly autonomous. We run in a very individual way. We even do our own tax and treasury, believe it or not. It’s very distributed and so – but it’s still – I come from very entrepreneurial backgrounds and so how do we make sure that we continue to make sure that the speed with which we’re operating, even inside of OpenTable, is one that is the right pace? We have to have a mix though because we have a business that’s running and growing, and then there’s some blank sheet stuff that we’re working on. And so trying to find kind of that schizophrenia between that highly frenetic entrepreneurial go, go, go, go. How do we think about this problem? It has never been done before. Let’s go tackle it with hey, deeply operational. We’re out there selling restaurants, day in, day out, and so just trying to find people who fit on one side of that schematic versus the other.
Rascoff: So the corporate parent provides a lot of capital, expertise sometimes, sort of when asked it sounds like, but not –
Quarles: And frankly, shielding from the public market. The benefit that we have is we don’t directly communicate OpenTable results to the public. It’s sort of put into categories, and so what that enables us to do, I think, is play long ball with discipline. Many companies try, many companies who are not public, all these stay private forever, stay private longer, they all tell themselves they’re playing long ball, but you don’t necessarily have discipline when you’re a private company in the way that you do as a public company, as I’m sure you fully recognize. We absolutely have discipline, but rare is the company that can have the Amazon-like freedom to just invest years at a time, but I think what the beauty of the Priceline Group is they say look, we’re going to make an investment in OpenTable, but it’s going to be done with a heck of a lot of discipline and we’re going to make bets that might pay off in a couple years.
Rascoff: And just to give listeners perspective, I think the Priceline acquisition of OpenTable was around $2.5 billion, and the market cap at Priceline is $70 billion, $60, $70, $80 billion, somewhere in that range.
Quarles: Yeah, it could be even $75.
Rascoff: So OpenTable is a very small part of Priceline Group. Therefore you can, as you say, play the long ball because you’re not going to impact the stock day to day, and so Priceline’s willing to make long-term investments in the future at OpenTable.
Quarles: Although as they point out, booking is obviously the behemoth in the group. It still matters whether I beat my numbers or not, and so it’s more around the expectation of conscious investment, but I very much have to beat the numbers. But I think it is an opportunity to say, “Hey, yeah, we’re not the largest part of the group for certain, but dining is a $3 trillion market. How do you dream really big and be in position to take on a much bigger chunk of the market than we currently are today?”
Rascoff: I’ve been a big proponent of dual-class stock, which Zillow Group has, which allows us to play long ball at Zillow Group and not worry as much about near-term stock price volatility because it’s founder controlled. But being part of a much larger entity is another hack to allow a company like OpenTable to be long-term oriented. Let’s talk about rebuilding your management team when you came in. How many people have you hired among your direct reports? How many direct reports do you have? What were you looking for as you rebuilt that team? And did you do it sort of serially, like you wanted to – you hired one and then saw how that person fit on the team, and then the next and the next, or you went for several people at once?
Quarles: There’s a couple things that I did. First of all, hiring is incredibly challenging. It’s a full time job. You’re out there always, and I think there is little known about what my ambition was for OpenTable. And so if you were just getting the call kind of blind, you were going, “Oh, OpenTable. Yeah, they went public. What happened?” And there wasn’t necessarily an understanding of where – so a lot of it was sort of internal PR and trying to just get people to recognize what the opportunity and ambition was. In terms of how you go about it, you try – I ended up trying to look for both a CFO and I split the product role into two. We had kind of a head of product overall, but the restaurant product and the consumer product are vastly different.
Rascoff: The restaurant part meaning the software that restaurants use?
Quarles: Yeah and it’s basically – it’s a B2B SaaS product with – that’s essentially part inventory management, almost like a saver, and part CRM. And so the skill set needed there really different from a traditional consumer product background. So I ended up looking for all three of those roles at the same time, which was not easy or awesome.
[Laughter]
Rascoff: How did employees handle that? They had a new CEO, and they knew there were other leadership changes coming?  Was that –?
Quarles: Again, I had all the hats so I guess that’s good and bad, and so – and then I’ve also – have a new head of HR, people and culture, as we call it here at OpenTable, starting in two weeks. And then we elevated some of our sales and our internal folks into more senior roles inside the company. There’s been a mix and shift of all of it and I think the challenge is each person you add and subtract changes the alchemy of that group. And one of the things that I really wanted to do when I first came in, I’m a very much a radical candor, as my friend Kim Scott will attest to, who wrote the book on that, but it’s – I think it was my first week taking over the team and we were talking about what we were working on for the next, I think, board meeting. And I said, “OK, now disagree with me.” And everyone was silent and so I think I’ve now created a culture where people feel very comfortable speaking up and reaching out, but it has to be a safe environment where they feel like, “Hey, I can exercise my opinion. I can disagree, but I’m not going to be impugned for doing so.” And each new person you add, you’ve got to test the chemistry of how that’s going to work and the dynamic, and it’s a little scary, I’ll say, every time you add a new person because you just never quite know. As much as the interviewing process is helpful, it never really gives you that sense of everybody at once and that’s the biggest challenge in making sure that that the norms of the groups are – the group are understood and frankly, appreciated and respected.
Rascoff: Isn’t it amazing that no matter how much technology there is in our businesses, at the end of the day, it’s still all about people, right?
Quarles: Until the machines take over, the humans – we’re an interesting lot and we don’t always behave at least visually rationally. I’m sure it’s rational underneath, but it’s hard because you’re managing people’s ambitions, and they’re bringing their family and their lives into the office every single day. And so you’re trying to make that blend work and where are they in their stage of career and how long have they been here, and all those different factors weigh in to how they’re going to – what person they’re bringing to the office that day.
Rascoff: You’ve touched on several themes that I’m pretty passionate about. The importance of encouraging dissent is something that I talk about a lot. Radical candor, we actually had one of the co-authors come and speak at our exec offsite, and the point is that you show someone that you care and then you’re radically candid with them, so that that’s the best way to provide feedback and it’s something that we preach at Zillow for sure.
You said something really interesting. You said each person that you add or subtract to that leadership team changes the chemistry, changes the alchemy of the group. Have you had situations in your career here or elsewhere where somebody perhaps was a high performer sort of on a different team and they still have the same skill set, but they don’t perform well with this other team because of the chemistry?
Quarles: Yeah, it happened actually when were at Playdom. We had a pretty well-functioning group and then we added a new leader role in that group. And I think what was challenging was it was a very different style than that person was used to operating in and had been at very large companies where sometimes the political game was more important. And it was disruptive and I saw it happening kind of in real time, and I think I want to be conscious to – the beauty of it is when you’re in the leadership role, it’s fully in your power and control to prevent that from happening. And so if you see even hints of behaviors that you don’t think are advantageous to that group functioning well, you tamp them out and you tamp them out quickly. And I think that’s that key is – the beauty of being in that role, you have the power to change the dynamics and really set the norms, but I have seen it and it can be destructive.  I think it can create side conversations inside negotiations and discussions that then people aren’t necessarily bringing their whole honest selves into the room, and I think the group decision making suffers as a result.
Rascoff: Yeah, I’ve seen situations where somebody – their chemistry with the rest of the team worked well in one particular role and they move into some other role or the team around them changes and they’re no longer successful. The other thing I’ve seen, kind of the corollary to that, is a particular management style works, that that person has, works well when the business is in a particular state. Let’s say a person oversees, three or four different parts of the business, and everything is going pretty well and so they’re managing kind of at 10,000 feet, and then one of the areas of those – of that business does not perform well and it’s time for them to go down to – into the trenches and they don’t do a good job transitioning between those two states. It’s interesting because the person’s skill set hasn’t changed. They have all the same intellect, the same energy, passion, whatever, but they were successful in one – at one point in time and they’re no longer successful at another.
Quarles: The key question I always ask in there is your work avoidance. What are the things that you hate doing in your job? And in that situation, if you’re not good at going down deep, then you better find a strategy so that you don’t have to and so you better make sure people are around you. And you make sure succession planning is thought through because if you’re put in a position where you’re having to do the part of your job that you frankly hate, you’re not going to be good at it. You’re not going to enjoy it and temporary is one thing, but if you – you better have a strategy around that. I’m always asking people what part of your job you hate. There’s always a part of your job you hate so then what are your strategies for mitigation? How do you get around that? And if those strategies fail, like somebody leaves and now they’re having to dive in, then it’s a signal to me that they’re going to have some challenges and they haven’t thought through or don’t understand frankly what those weaknesses are because it’s all about self awareness.
Rascoff: This is as another one of my management tenets is that when people aren’t doing their job effectively, it’s usually not because they don’t have the particular skill set to do that job well. It’s because of a low level of engagement because they’re not fired up about that particular role at that point in time. In theory, you’ve done a good enough job screening them for their skill set on the way in. There are exceptions obviously, but it’s more about making sure that they’re engaged in that particular role and a key way to improve engagement is to try to remove things that they don’t like doing from their job.
Let’s talk about innovation. This is a company that, again, was started in 1998 and I worry about this a lot at Zillow. We started in 2006, so we’re now in our second decade. Most tech companies lose a step in their – at the end of their first decade and they lose two or three steps in their second decade and most of them falter, and there are very few category leaders that are ten or more years old. OpenTable has benefited from its really strong network effect. You have a lot of restaurants. That gets a lot of diners. You have a lot of diners. That gets a lot of restaurants and network effects are notoriously difficult to disrupt, but that could also create a lazy environment where you’re not being forced into it because you don’t feel like you’re under constant attack. So how do you maintain innovation with a company that’s been around as long as OpenTable?
Quarles: Yeah, and I would say OpenTable did wait a little too long to modernize its overall stack for example. It was a monolithic code base up until 2012, and now a lot of that work has been done to chop it up into a service oriented architecture and we can ship every day, which was so not the case even several years ago. If you start thinking about rapid iterative AB testing culture, that was something that wasn’t even possible technically inside the organization just a handful of years ago. That has been really important to kind of transition that all, I think, but continuing to look forward and say okay, what are the new ways forward for our business?
Obviously mobile is the majority of our dining activity. Now that’s happening in those devices and what’s interesting is we’re seeing entirely different use cases appear because I know where you are. I know what’s available near you and so this whole dining within the hour is a brand new use case that didn’t even exist several years ago, before the mobile device came to be. I think the cool thing is when I do look forward and thinking about an AI driven world and where machine learning is going and how do our data science teams learn and iterate and operate, so one area is just I want to create the ultimate restaurant recommendation engine. The most frustrating thing is you go and you go like, “Oh, I want to go to restaurant X,” and it’s booked up or something, or it’s maybe not even on the OpenTable network, although there are very few restaurants that are not on OpenTable, and you should all be on OpenTable. But it’s still saying, “Oh, I know where that restaurant’s located.  I know the price point. I know the menu items. I know all this information, all this signal, and I hopefully know something about you at this point. I know what your preferences have been. I know where you’ve dined in the past. How do I create recommendations specifically for you?”
Rascoff: What about payments? How important is payments to your innovation, so being able to get up from the table at the end of a meal and have OpenTable pay?
Quarles: Yeah, we have dabbled a lot and we’ve innovated a lot in payments, and I’m on my now third iteration on the payment. I would say on payments in general, and I think anytime you look at financial innovation, you see these really slow adoption curves and then eventually it kinks up. Look at ATM adoption, even online banking adoption, and I still contend that we’re in year two of the seven year journey on mobile payments.
Rascoff: Is it harder to get the restaurants on board or the diners?
Quarles: It’s harder to get the restaurants on board and primarily because they’re wedded to a point of sale system so they have MICROS primarily in the United States and other countries, it’s a different point of sale system. And there’s just not a lot of motivation to integrate the point of sale so that’s been the challenge, and so we’ve tried a number things. We tried the full on point of sale integration just because. I think we’ve also tried to go around the point of sale system. We had a product called OpenTable Tab that we were trying to understand and see is that the right solution. We’re now looking and saying OK, is there another way to get into point of sale? Apple Pay has just hit its two year anniversary and I think still trying to make progress. I do believe though when you’ve experienced an OpenTable pay restaurant, it is magic. It is magic. You’re sitting there. You can see the items showing up in your phone, and then – and it just happened to me the other day. I had to go. I had a meeting I had to get to and I just hit the bar, slide it over, and I’m good to go, and there’s no dance at the end of the dining. People want that Uber-ization in the restaurant experience. They want to not be wed to – but its how do I get all the infrastructure in place to actually get it accomplished?  We’re looking at how do we do that and we’re making progress, but I always wish it was faster.
Rascoff: It’s interesting. When I asked about innovation, you immediately went to the importance of making sure that the technology is service-oriented, allows for rapid iteration, and it sounds like you probably went through a big re-architecture to enable that. Did you find other parts of the organization, like HR, PR, social media, consumer marketing, finance even, all of the sudden became more innovative when they saw a product team that was able to ship code daily, weekly, instead of every quarter or two and there was more product innovation happening for the consumer, now all of the sudden these other nontechnical parts of the organization started being more innovative?
Quarles: Well, and I think it goes into just the – and the importance of data, frankly, and it’s that line. If you have data, bring the data. If we’re using opinion, let’s use mine. I’ve encouraged every single department here to know your data and so if you’re in HR, you should know who are the employees. Where are they going? What’s the retention rate of our employees? If it’s in finance, you better know your numbers and data, but just across the board and how data plays into this role of we – our PM sounds like, “We don’t know if it’s going to work.:” Obviously, I have a point of view, but we’re often surprised and so being in position to let the data help show you the way. How do you steer the whole company to getting and receiving, analyzing, and knowing their data? When I’m in a meeting and I ask a fairly simple question, I think, and somebody can’t get the answer quickly, it’s a bad sign for me. It’s like, uh-oh, they don’t know their business. They don’t know their data. And then I ask, “Well, why can’t you? Is it hard to get? Are we not looking at those?” One of the things I’m trying to do is we were all about the reservation and we spent very little time thinking about what happened before the reservation. All the tagging of activity of just user behavior prior to a reservation hadn’t really been focused on and so we weren’t even collecting the data in some instances. So how were we going to help drive discovery when we don’t even know what’s happening prior to the reservation? Getting a whole lot more kind of on people to kind of understand what those pre-conditions are to what ultimately makes us money here, which is that connection between the restaurant and the diner.
Rascoff: Is there anything you would have done differently thinking now back on your first year as CEO? If you knew then what you know now, anything that you would have changed?
Quarles: I don’t know if I would have taken on so many jobs at once, frankly. It was not good for my sleep or gray hair, to be honest. It was hard on me and so I might have been measured, and part of it is when I feel like it’s not going to work, I just end it.  I don’t prolong. I don’t wait. I just say, “Hey, this isn’t going to work for your or us,” and so moving quickly on those, I don’t really regret it. It’s just it’s personally painful sometimes.
Rascoff: It took a toll, right. OK, well, congratulations.  I use OpenTable probably two or three times a week.
Quarles: We love you.
Rascoff:  I look forward to the day when I can use payments at the end of every meal because you’re right, it is magic when you can do that. And congratulations and I should add for listeners that your GlassDoor CEO approval rating is awesome. I think even higher than mine so that’s – it was a point of pride for me and now there’s a little friendly competition between me and you on our GlassDoor ratings. Anyway, thanks a lot. Congratulations.
Quarles: Thanks so much, Spencer.
