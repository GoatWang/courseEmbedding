Item Description: Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, New York, 1900. Book Condition: Good. First edition thus. An ex library copy with markings to the spine and endpapers. A single bound volume of six complete issues without original wraps are advertisements. Small quarto, 9 3/4" tall, vi + 768 pages, three-quarter leather over marbled boards with gilt spine titles. Overall, a good, clean, sturdy hard cover with shelf wear with rubbing at the corners, hinges cracked, leather back strip loosened, interior hinges and binding solid, paper clean and lightly yellowed. This is the publisher's edition, printed from the original plates and includes all of the editorial material (articles, stories, poetry, etc.) of the separate issues but lacks the advertisements and individual covers. It was the practice of the time for most of the better literary magazines to issue such editions before melting down the original printers' plates. Note: the earlier 'Scribner's Monthly' had been retitled 'The Century Magazine' in 1881, under new management. This 'Scribner's Magazine' began publication in January 1887 under the editorship of the legendary Edward L. Burlingame and set a new standard for older publications such as 'Harper's' and 'Atlantic,' publishing many more women writers, developing new illustrators, as well as authors, while fashioning a more 'modern' and accessible style of prose for the reader. Subject matters range from art, fiction, and poetry to history and science. As such it makes a terrific read as an anthology of its moment in time. Three-quarter leather over boards.
