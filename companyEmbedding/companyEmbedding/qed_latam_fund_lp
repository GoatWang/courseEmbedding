However, the new agreement between Scotiabank and QED Investors will help stimulate the industry’s development with new capital and industry talent in the region.QED already has a strong regional presence throughout LATAM, including Nubank, Guiabolso, Pitzi, Bankfacil in Brazil – the group has also recently expanded its model to Mexico through an investment in Konfio.Per the agreement, Scotiabank will be assisting QED Investors in its evaluation of potential strategic investments across several Pacific Alliance countries, i.e. Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, helping bring strategic funding, resources, customers and experience to these markets.According to Ignacio Deschamps, Group Head, International Banking and Digital Transformation at Scotiabank, in a statement on the collaboration: “With QED’s hands-on fintech experience, we will be uniquely positioned to partner with the emerging ecosystem of fintechs in Latin America. The business models of fintechs are attractive to consumers and an opportunity for us to learn, invest and partner.”Share this article Tags: fintech / investment / Latin America / QED / Scotiabank Got a news tip?

Canada’s Scotiabank and QED Investors have teamed up to launch a venture capital platform that will invest in Latin American fintech startups. QED Investors will manage the fund, while Scotiabank will help its partner to assess potential investments, and also provide financing and resources to specific Latin American markets. QED Investors is a U.S. boutique venture capital firm.
PRESS RELEASE
Scotiabank partners with QED Investors to promote FinTech start-ups in Latin America
TORONTO, ON and ALEXANDRIA, VA–(Marketwired – December 08, 2016) – Scotiabank and QED Investors announced today a new and innovative partnership that will inject capital and industry expertise into select Latin American FinTech companies. The joint investment will create a venture capital platform that will identify, invest and promote the growth of innovative start-ups across the FinTech spectrum that look to improve customer products and experiences in Latin America.
As the manager of the fund, QED Investors will bring their deep expertise in the financial services sector and a track record of building groundbreaking FinTech businesses. Scotiabank will assist QED Investors in its evaluation of potential strategic investments in the Pacific Alliance countries (Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru) and bring strategic funding, resources, customers and experience in these markets. This fund will seek out companies in Latin American countries focused on financial technology disruptors. 





“We are excited to partner with QED Investors as their experience and deep understanding of customer trends, FinTech business models and digital disruption will help us bring leading edge best practices in innovation to our customers,” said Ignacio (Nacho) Deschamps, Group Head, International Banking and Digital Transformation at Scotiabank. “With QED’s hands-on FinTech experience, we will be uniquely positioned to partner with the emerging ecosystem of FinTechs in Latin America. The business models of FinTechs are attractive to consumers and an opportunity for us to learn, invest and partner.”
“We see significant opportunities for FinTechs in Latin America, and look forward to leveraging our entrepreneurial and operational expertise to the companies we will invest in,” said Bill Cilluffo, a Partner in QED Investors responsible for Latin America. “Scotiabank is a natural partner for this fund due to its strong presence in the region and its ambitious digital transformation agenda.”
Scotiabank’s digital strategy has increased technology and customer experience investments over the past 18 months in pursuit of aggressive digital goals. Execution of this strategy has yielded the appointment of Silicon Valley tech leader Shawn Rose as Executive Vice President, Digital Banking; creation of the Digital Factories in Toronto, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru, to build world-class digital customer experiences; investment in emerging areas such as analytics and machine learning; establishment of groundbreaking partnership models with leading business schools; and direct investment in innovative FinTechs like Kabbage and SecureKey. 





QED Investors was co-founded by Nigel Morris, who also co-founded Capital One, and brings decades of experience as investors, operators and builders. Their approach is to share their knowledge and ability with the disruptors they choose to work with to help them navigate their rapid growth. QED has made investments in the US and the international FinTech industry, notably in Credit-Karma, Green Sky and many others. Over the last two years, QED has independently built a successful Latin American portfolio, including NuBank, Guiabolso, Pitzi, Bankfacil in Brazil, and has recently expanded this model to Mexico through its investment in Konfio.

Scotiabank Partners with QED Investors to Promote FinTech Start-ups in Latin America

December 10, 2016



 


(ACN Newswire) Scotiabank and QED Investors announced a partnership to inject capital and industry expertise into select Latin American FinTech companies. The joint investment will create a venture capital platform that will identify, invest and promote the growth of innovative start-ups across the fintech spectrum that look to improve customer products and experiences in Latin America.
“We’ve been investing in Brazil for a little over two years, with four portfolio companies (BankFacil, GuiaBolso, Pitzi, Nubank), and we did our first investment this year in Mexico in Konfio,” says QED partner Bill Cilluffo. “With this new fund, we are actively looking at other opportunities in these markets, and will be exploring other countries within LatAm.”

Scotiabank and QED Investors announced today a new and innovative partnership that will inject capital and industry expertise into select Latin American FinTech companies. The joint investment will create a venture capital platform that will identify, invest and promote the growth of innovative start-ups across the FinTech spectrum that look to improve customer products and experiences in Latin America.
As the manager of the fund, QED Investors will bring their deep expertise in the financial services sector and a track record of building groundbreaking FinTech businesses. Scotiabank will assist QED Investors in its evaluation of potential strategic investments in the Pacific Alliance countries (Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru) and bring strategic funding, resources, customers and experience in these markets. This fund will seek out companies in Latin American countries focused on financial technology disruptors.
“We are excited to partner with QED Investors as their experience and deep understanding of customer trends, FinTech business models and digital disruption will help us bring leading edge best practices in innovation to our customers,” said Ignacio (Nacho) Deschamps, Group Head, International Banking and Digital Transformation at Scotiabank. “With QED’s hands-on FinTech experience, we will be uniquely positioned to partner with the emerging ecosystem of FinTechs in Latin America. The business models of FinTechs are attractive to consumers and an opportunity for us to learn, invest and partner.”
“We see significant opportunities for FinTechs in Latin America, and look forward to leveraging our entrepreneurial and operational expertise to the companies we will invest in,” said Bill Cilluffo, a Partner in QED Investors responsible for Latin America. “Scotiabank is a natural partner for this fund due to its strong presence in the region and its ambitious digital transformation agenda.”
Scotiabank’s digital strategy has increased technology and customer experience investments over the past 18 months in pursuit of aggressive digital goals. Execution of this strategy has yielded the appointment of Silicon Valley tech leader Shawn Rose as Executive Vice President, Digital Banking; creation of the Digital Factories in Toronto, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru, to build world-class digital customer experiences; investment in emerging areas such as analytics and machine learning; establishment of groundbreaking partnership models with leading business schools; and direct investment in innovative FinTechs like Kabbage and SecureKey.
QED Investors was co-founded by Nigel Morris, who also co-founded Capital One, and brings decades of experience as investors, operators and builders. Their approach is to share their knowledge and ability with the disruptors they choose to work with to help them navigate their rapid growth. QED has made investments in the US and the international FinTech industry, notably in Credit-Karma, Green Sky and many others. Over the last two years, QED has independently built a successful Latin American portfolio, including NuBank, Guiabolso, Pitzi, Bankfacil in Brazil, and has recently expanded this model to Mexico through its investment in Konfio.
