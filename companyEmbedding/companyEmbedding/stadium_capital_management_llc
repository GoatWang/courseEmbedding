Stadium Capital LLC - Terms of Use








TERMS OF USE
AGREEMENT TO TERMS OF USE
Please read the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") before using the Stadium Capital Management, LLC (the "Firm") website (the "Site"). Your access to and use of the Site is subject to these Terms of Use and all applicable laws and regulations. The Terms of Use constitute a legal agreement between you and the Firm. The Site is available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Site is not available to children (persons under the age of 18). By accessing and using the Site, you accept, without qualification, these Terms of Use. If you do not approve and accept these Terms of Use without qualification, you should exit the Site immediately.
PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION
The Site is for your personal and non-commercial use, and the Firm grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited personal license to access and use the Site, conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms of Use. You may not modify, copy (except as set forth below), distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell any information, products or services obtained from the Site. You may not link other websites to the Site without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may print one hardcopy of the information and download one temporary copy of the information into one single computer's memory solely for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for distribution, provided that all relevant copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices are kept intact. You may not allow others to use your user name or password to access or use any part of the Site. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should contact the Firm immediately for a new password. If you provide your password to any third party, you will be solely responsible for any actions taken by such third party using your password. All information on the non-public (i.e., password-restricted) areas of the Site is confidential and private and may not be disclosed or distributed by you to any other person for any purpose and is made available solely for your personal use in connection with your investment activities. You are prohibited from using the Site to advertise or perform any commercial solicitation. You also are prohibited from using any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Site for any purpose without the prior written permission of the Firm. You may not take any action that imposes, or may impose, in our sole discretion, an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site, or bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
NO SECURITIES OFFERING OR INVESTMENT ADVICE
The funds advised by the Firm are not offered through the Site. An offer regarding any such fund may be made only after you have received a Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum concerning that fund and have had the opportunity to discuss all matters concerning any prospective investment that you desire. The Site does not provide all information material to an investor's decision to invest in any such fund, including, but not limited to, risk factors. For more information, please refer to a fund's Confidential Offering Circular or Private Offering Memorandum and read it carefully before you invest.

The information on the Site is intended to enable investors to understand the nature of the Firm's financial advisory services. It is not intended as and does not constitute investment advice or legal or tax advice or an offer to sell any securities to any person or a solicitation of any person of any offer to purchase any securities. The information in the Site should not be construed as any endorsement, recommendation or sponsorship of any company or security by the Firm. There are inherent risks in relying on, using or retrieving any information found on the Site, and the Firm urges you to make sure you understand these risks before relying on, using or retrieving any information on the Site. You should evaluate the information made available through the Site, and you should seek the advice of professionals, as appropriate, to evaluate any opinion, advice, product, service or other information.

The Firm's services are designed to integrate with the services provided by its clients' other financial, legal and tax advisers, not to replace their services. The Firm advises its clients from time to time on non-investment related matters, but clients must rely on their other professional advisers for final approval and/or implementation of non-investment matters.

You acknowledge that any requests for information are unsolicited and any information provided shall neither constitute nor be construed as investment advice by the Firm to you or constitute the formation of an investment advisory relationship, or any other client relationship. It is strongly recommended that you seek outside advice from a qualified securities professional. The Firm does not guarantee the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source. The Firm may invest or otherwise hold an interest in companies or securities that may be discussed on the Site.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE
The performance data presented in the Site reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees and incentive fees and allocations.

The Firm believes that the performance shown in the Site was generated with an investment philosophy and methodology similar to that described in the funds' respective Confidential Offering Circulars and Private Offering Memoranda, that it would expect to use in the future. Future investments, however, will be made under different economic conditions and in different securities and may be made using different investment strategies than were used during the times discussed herein. Furthermore, the performance discussed herein reflects investment of limited funds for a limited period of time and does not reflect performance in different economic or market cycles. It should not be assumed that any fund advised by the Firm will experience returns, if any, comparable to those described herein. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund's financial statements for the current year are audited.

The Firm believes that the comparison of each fund's performance to any single market index is inappropriate. These indices are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices, each fund's portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, may include short sales of securities, margin trading and securities of smaller capitalization companies than those reflected in these indices, and is not as diversified as these indices. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund's portfolio and these indices, the Firm cautions potential investors that no such index is directly comparable to any fund.
TRUTHFUL INFORMATION
As a condition to your use of the Site, you represent and warrant to, and agree with the Firm that, all of the information that you provide is truthful, accurate and complete.
DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
