amending and restating the first three paragraphs thereof as follows:  (a)  (b) Based on information provided by the Issuer, the following
disclosure assumes that there are 113,282,973 Common Units outstanding, as reported by the Issuer in its Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 28, 2016.
 Based on this number of outstanding Common Units, as of January 23, 2017, the aggregate number and percentage of the Common Units beneficially owned

Item 6.
Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.  Item

Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by amending and restating the subsection titled Board Designation Rights:
 Pursuant to the terms of the GSO Transaction Agreement (as amended):   


 

 
For so long as Rentech, RNHI and DSHC (collectively, the Rentech Partnership Unitholders) and their Included Assignees (as defined in the Rentech Transaction Agreement) have record and beneficial
ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) of Common Units that constitute at least 7.5% of the outstanding Common Units,
the GSO Funds shall be entitled to appoint one director to the CVR Board. 




 

 
If at any time the Rentech Partnership Unitholders and their Included Assignees have record and beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
Common Units that constitute less than 7.5% of the outstanding Common Units, the right of the GSO Funds to appoint one director pursuant to the GSO Transaction Agreement shall forever terminate. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Rentech Transaction Agreement, the GSO Funds are considered Included Assignees of the Rentech Partnership Unitholders until
