Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Stock market opens lower as Wall Street resumes tech selling
              
              U.S. stock benchmarks opened modestly lower on Friday after a key measure of U.S. economic growth showed improvement, but also highlighted stubbornly low inflation. A second-quarter reading on gross domestic product rose 2.6%, below the 2.8% expected by economists polled by MarketWatch, showed that wages are accelerating more slowly than hoped, signaling the economy may still not be improving, but not running at full tilt. The Dow Jones Industrial Average --coming off its record close on Thursday--was trading flat, as corporate quarterly results from Dow components Exxon Mobil Corp.  disappointed Wall Street, while Merck & Co. Inc.  reported better-than-expected results. The S&P 500 index  was off 0.2% at 2,469, weighed by a 1% drop in the consumer-discretionary sector.

Our Retail Partners
We’re really happy to show off all the amazing retailers that we have had the pleasure to work with over the years and continue to have a great relationship with. This list grows year on year especially now that we’re expanding into new territories. We deal with independent shops on Britain’s high streets all the way up to the biggest chain retailers in the world and everything in between.
Below is by no means an exhaustive list but gives you a great insight into some of the companies we’re proud to call partners.
