Market Phase not started






Aurinia is committed to working in areas of high unmet medical need and is poised to potentially deliver the first approved therapy in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of lupus nephritis, or LN.
The Voclosporin Advantage
Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (“CNI”) with clinical data in over 2,200 patients across indications. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant, with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential to improve near- and long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN) when added to standard of care mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). It has been granted “fast track status” by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA).
Voclosporin Could Transform the LN treatment Landscape
Voclosporin has the potential to become a best in class medication and the first approved treatment for LN in the U.S. and Europe, effectively altering the current treatment paradigm for the disease.
Advantages of Voclosporin Combined with Standard of Care (SoC)
Our Phase II clinical data suggests that adding voclosporin to the current SoC of MMF for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) can yield superior results to using the standard of care alone.
Additionally, voclosporin may prove to be an ideal therapy for lupus nephritis due to advantages such as:

Improved efficacy
Increased safety
Oral administration
Improved average time to renal response or remission
Improved duration of renal response
Reduction in steroid burden
Potential first line add-on to MMF
Fewer toxic immunosuppressants required


Potential Benefits of Voclosporin
In clinical trials, Voclosporin has been shown to be especially effective in the presence of low dose steroids with rapid reduction of LN inflammatory markers and overall improved renal stability.
The list of potential product benefits includes:



LN Critical Need
Voclosporin* (based on AURA Results)


Control of Active Disease




Rapid Disease Control




Lower Steroid Burden




Impact on Extra-renal disease




Convenient Treatment Regimen





*Based on AURA Results

In previous studies, over 2000 patients have been treated with Voclosporin with no abnormal or unexpected SAE’s

Well Characterized Safety Profile
Efficacy of calcineurin inhibition has already been established. Voclosporin has a well-characterized safety profile (over 2,200 patient exposures across multiple years) across indications.
No new safety signals were observed with the use of Voclosporin in LN patients; Voclosporin was well-tolerated and renal function remained stable in clinical studies. The overall safety profile is consistent with other immunosuppressive drugs.

"Voclosporin
    has the potential to become a best in class medication and the first
    approved treatment for LN in the U.S. and Europe, effectively altering the
    current treatment paradigm for the disease."




Overview

Aurinia is
    committed to working in areas of high unmet medical need and is poised to
    deliver the first approved therapy in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment
    of lupus nephritis, or LN.






Profile
Aurinia
    Pharmaceuticals (AUPH) is a
    late-stage biopharmaceutical company providing novel products specifically
    engineered to treat a limited, targeted patient population suffering from
    serious disease states for which there is a high unmet medical need.
Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a
    novel and potentially best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor with clinical data
    in over 2,000 patients across indications. Voclosporin is an
    immunosuppressant, with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has
    the potential to improve near- and long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN)
    when added to standard of care mycophenolate mofetil. It has been granted
    �fast track status� by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA).

Voclosporin has the potential to become a
    best in class medication and the first approved treatment for LN in the U.S.
    and Europe, effectively altering the current treatment paradigm for the
    disease.




AUPH
    Investor Highlights

Results: Announced top-line results from its Phase IIb AURA-LV study in lupus
        nephritis. At 48 weeks, the trial met the complete and partial remission
        endpoints, demonstrating statistically significantly greater CR and PR
        in patients in both low dose  and high dose cohorts versus the
        control group.
Fast Track: In clinical
        trials, Voclosporin has been shown to be especially effective in the
        presence of low dose steroids with rapid reduction of LN inflammatory
        markers and overall improved renal stability.
Established:
        Efficacy of calcineurin inhibition has already been established.
        Voclosporin has a well-characterized safety profile (over 2,000 patient
        exposures across multiple years) across indications.
Broad Patient Base - 
        Announced the results of a supportive Phase I safety, pharmacokinetic
        and pharmacodynamic study in healthy Japanese patients which supports
        further development of voclosporin in this patient population.
Phase III - 
 Announced that it has selected Worldwide Clinical Trials
        as its Clinical Research Organization for the AURORA Phase 3 study of
        volcosporin for the treatment of active lupus nephritis (LN).
Potential - Aurinia�s
        voclosporin has the potential to become the first FDA-approved treatment
        for LN.
Collaboration - 
        Announced it has entered into a long-term agreement with Lonza for the
        manufacture of voclosporin active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).

Aurinia Selects Worldwide Clinical Trials as its CRO for Phase 3 Lupus Nephritis Trial



 Download as PDF

January 27, 2017


      - Single Phase 3 Trial on track to commence in Q2 2017

    VICTORIA, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: AUPH / TSX: AUP) (“Aurinia” or the
      “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the
      global immunology market, today announced that it has selected Worldwide
      Clinical Trials (“Worldwide”) as its Clinical Research Organization
      (CRO) for the AURORA Phase 3 study of volcosporin for the treatment of
      active lupus nephritis (LN).
    

      “Selecting a CRO for AURORA is a key milestone for Aurinia following our
      successful end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food & Drug
      Administration (FDA) Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology
      Products. We are thrilled to partner with Worldwide to support the
      AURORA Phase 3 clinical trial,” said Charles Rowland, Chief Executive
      Officer of Aurinia. “We are rapidly moving forward with our plans to
      bring this important therapy to market for patients living with this
      devastating disease, and Worldwide’s deep expertise and capabilities in
      managing pivotal trials will be a tremendous asset to us. We are on
      track to commence the AURORA trial in the second quarter of 2017, and we
      expect the results from this study will support a New Drug Application
      (NDA) submission to the FDA.”
    

      With support from Worldwide, Aurinia will proceed with conducting a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind global 52-week trial in
      approximately 320 patients. The primary endpoint as in the Phase 2b AURA
      trial is renal response (complete remission), at 24 weeks. In addition
      to the assessment of renal response, a key marker of clinical benefit in
      this population is the duration of proteinuria improvement. Therefore,
      secondary endpoints will include the duration of renal response at 52
      weeks (48 weeks in AURA), an efficacy measure which delineates
      durability of renal response (remission), an important parameter in
      evaluating long-term outcomes for the treatment of LN.
    

      “Our entire Worldwide team is delighted to have been selected as
      Aurinia’s CRO partner to advance voclosporin, which has the potential to
      become the first FDA-approved treatment for LN,” said Peter Benton,
      President and Chief Operating Officer at Worldwide Clinical Trials.
      “We’re truly honored that an innovator like Aurinia recognizes what
      Worldwide brings to the table: medical and scientific expertise,
      proactive insight, dogged determination, rigorous processes and a
      commitment to getting it right. We’re looking forward to working closely
      with Aurinia’s clinical development team on this new therapy, which
      could significantly improve the lives and long-term outcomes of patients
      suffering from LN.”
    

About Voclosporin


      Voclosporin, an investigational drug, is a novel and potentially
      best-in-class calcineurin inhibitor (“CNI”) with clinical data in over
      2,000 patients across indications. Voclosporin is an immunosuppressant,
      with a synergistic and dual mechanism of action that has the potential
      to improve near- and long-term outcomes in LN when added to standard of
      care (MMF). By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2
      expression and T-cell mediated immune responses. It is made by a
      modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule which
      has shown a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      relationship, an increase in potency, an altered metabolic profile, and
      potential for flat dosing. The Company anticipates that upon regulatory
      approval, patent protection for voclosporin will be extended in the
      United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and
      Japan, until at least October 2027 under the Hatch-Waxman Act and
      comparable laws in other countries.
    

About Lupus Nephritis (LN)


      Lupus Nephritis (LN) in an inflammation of the kidney caused by Systemic
      Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and represents a serious progression of SLE.
      SLE is a chronic, complex and often disabling disorder and affects more
      than 500,000 people in the United States (mostly women). The disease is
      highly heterogeneous, affecting a wide range of organs & tissue systems.
      It is estimated that as many as 60% of all SLE patients have clinical LN
      requiring treatment. Unlike SLE, LN has straightforward disease outcomes
      where an early response correlates with long-term outcomes, measured by
      proteinuria. In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria
      and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal function as evidenced by
      reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased serum
      creatinine levels. LN is debilitating and costly and if poorly
      controlled, LN can lead to permanent and irreversible tissue damage
      within the kidney, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), thus
      making LN a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.
    

About AURORA


      The AURORA study is a 52-week global double-blind placebo controlled
      Phase III study that will compare the efficacy of one dose of
      voclosporin (23.7mg BID) or placebo added to current standard of care of
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, also known as CellCept®) in achieving renal
      response (formerly referred to as complete remission) in patients with
      active LN. Both arms will also receive low doses of corticosteroids as
      part of background therapy after a stringent taper. Aurinia believes
      this Phase III clinical trial whose design is consistent with the
      ongoing AURA study, will support a New Drug Application (NDA) submission.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
