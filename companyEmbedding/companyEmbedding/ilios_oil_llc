Ilios Continues to Expand Into New Markets with Sale in Puerto Rico

May 07, 2015, 10:05 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Ilios Dynamics Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


WALTHAM, Mass., May 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ilios Dynamics Inc., a subsidiary of Tecogen® Inc. (NASDAQ:   TGEN) today announced the sale of an Ilios HEWH-500-WS and an Ilios HEWH-500-AS; water-source and air-source gas engine-driven heat pumps, respectively.
The Ilios units, sold to Cogen RightFit, will be installed at two major multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Cogen RightFit, LLC is a joint venture between ESCOPR, one of Puerto Rico's premier energy conservation providers and Tropigas Puerto Rico, one of the largest LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) suppliers on the island.
"We are very excited to be working together with Cogen RightFit," said Stephen Lafaille, Ilios Product Manager. "ESCOPR has a great reputation on the island for providing engineered efficiency solutions and Tropigas is a major LPG supplier delivering competitive fuel pricing for customers – it's truly a winning combination. The energy costs are very high in Puerto Rico and the Ilios products deliver an immediate impact on the bottom line with minimal capital investment; a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and reduced pollutant emissions with Tecogen's patented Ultra™ after-treatment system."
"The sale of these Ilios units is just the beginning for us in Puerto Rico, said Jorge Hernandez, President of ESCOPR and Partner of Cogen RightFit, LLC. We are interested in not only the Ilios heat pumps but also all of Tecogen's packaged CHP products such as cogeneration modules and large gas-engine driven chillers. There is an incredible customer base here in Puerto Rico with many manufacturing and industrial clients, almost all of which have massive needs for process heating, cooling, and electricity, and often times all three simultaneously. These products will also be a great fit in the resort and hospitality sector which are increasingly becoming aware of their energy use and are looking to make energy reductions to improve their bottom line as well as their sustainable image."
"We see highly efficient, packaged CHP products such as the Ilios heat pump as an opportunity to sustainably grow our LPG business and continue to offset heavy fuel oils which unfortunately are still used in many industrial facilities on the island. These products will not only help convert our clients to clean burning LPG but they will do it in a way that saves them energy and reduces the carbon impact of their facility," said Humberto Berrios, President of Tropigas Puerto Rico and Cogen RightFit partner.
About Ilios Dynamics 
Ilios Dynamics Inc., a subsidiary of Tecogen Inc., was formed in April 2009 to develop and distribute a line of ultra high-efficiency heating products for commercial and industrial applications utilizing advanced thermodynamic principles. Products incorporate mechanical work to extract heat from the environment to supplement chemical energy available from natural gas or propane. The result is a significant boost in efficiency and reduced carbon emissions relative to conventional heating systems. Please visit www.iliosdynamics.com.

About Laura FitzGerald
At its core, Ilios Minerals, LLC is Laura M. FitzGerald, CPL.  She is the driving force behind the success of this acquisition company, and she is the vision for its growth and development in the future.  Laura has over 28 years experience in the oil and gas industry.  Through working as an independent landman for major oil and gas companies, she learned the ins and outs of the oil and gas business.  
Through all of her work experience with  various operators, Laura gained an understanding of their drilling and development patterns.  And she learned the signals and key indicators that often foreshadow an oil and gas play by the companies.  Laura's landman years also gave her the opportunity to make invaluable contacts, working with key personnel for several major oil and gas operators.  Today, these business relationships give her direct communication with operators. Laura also met hundreds of landowners during her time spent leasing and working title curative.  She has developed a rapport with many families and individuals, and these connections continue to help expand her contacts through direct referrals and word-of-mouth. 
Laura's skills and experience keep Ilios one step ahead of the competition.  Laura worked for many years as a paralegal for some of the premier oil and gas attorneys in Shreveport, prior to her career as a landman.  This provided a foundation from which she developed her skills further.  Because of her extensive study of drilling and production research, her understanding of the oil, gas, and mineral lease and all of its complexities, and her thorough knowledge of the Louisiana mineral code, Laura has an edge over the competition.  Laura and Ilios are truly in a league of their own.
