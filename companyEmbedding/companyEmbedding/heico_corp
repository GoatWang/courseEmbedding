    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Electronic Technologies Products & Services



Space and defense-related subcomponents are among the Electronic Technologies Group’s most significant markets. Our subcomponents are utilized in a wide array of commercial & defense satellites, aircraft, Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UASs”) and launch vehicles. Some of these systems are particularly well known. For example, two Electronic Technologies Group companies — Sierra Microwave Technologies and 3D Plus, supplied critical components on the Curiosity Mars Rover program which successfully landed on Mars in August 2012. VPT, Inc., another Electronic Technologies Group company, supplies all of the power converters on the latest generation of GPS satellites. Along with our dB Control and Ramona Research subsidiaries, VPT supplies critical components used in the principal UASs (often called "drones") used by the U.S. military. On these programs, the Electronic Technologies Group components or subcomponents can be found in the air-to-ground data link, radar and other on-board applications.
In addition to serving our historical aviation, space and defense markets, the Electronic Technologies Group has successfully expanded into adjacent markets which require comparable reliability and quality. Today, Electronic Technologies Group companies, such as Analog Modules, EMD Technologies, HVT Group, Leader Tech, Lumina Power and Switchcraft, all supply critical subcomponents for medical equipment. Examples of medical equipment that utilize our components include diagnostic imaging systems, like X-Ray and CT Scanners, lasers used for dermatological, dental and other applications, dosimetry and radiation therapy. Other high-reliability markets served by the Electronic Technologies Group include harsh environment telecommunications, underwater testing and scientific systems. These markets are a perfect match for HEICO because they require the same engineering, production and quality standards for difficult operating environments that are required in our traditional aerospace markets.

Electronic Technologies Group Acquires Midwest Microwave Solutions

Flight Support Group Buys Astroseal Products Manufacturing

	HOLLYWOOD, Fla., HIAWATHA, Iowa and CHESTER, Conn., Aug. 24, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI.A) (NYSE:HEI) today announced that it has completed two acquisitions, in addition to one announced last week.  Both purchases were made for cash, but other transaction terms and financial details were not disclosed.

	HEICO stated that it expects both acquisitions to be accretive to its earnings within the first year after the closing.

MIDWEST MICROWAVE SOLUTIONS, INC.

	The Company's Electronic Technologies Group completed the acquisition of 80.1% of the shares of privately-held Midwest Microwave Solutions, Inc. ("MMS") from MMS's founders/managers. 

	Hiawatha, IA-based MMS designs, manufactures and sells unique Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWAP-C) optimized Communications and Electronic Intercept Receivers and Tuners for military and intelligence applications.  MMS' front-end RF and Microwave hardware is used by the U.S. Intelligence Community for Signal Intercept applications, such as search, data collection, precision geolocation, direction finding and beamforming operations.

	Tracing its roots to 2005, MMS will continue to be 19.9%-owned by its founders and senior management team of President Phil Rezin, Chief Operating Officer Steve Wilson, and Chief Scientist Mike Horn.  The retained interest is subject to customary "call" and "put" rights for all shareholders commencing five years after the closing.  All three shareholders will remain in their pre-closing positions with MMS.

	MMS, which employs approximately 25 people, will continue its operations substantially as they existed before the purchase, including remaining in the same location and retaining its name.  HEICO also stated that it does not expect any employee turnover to result from the acquisition.

	Phil Rezin, MMS's Co-Founder and President, commented, "We're very excited to partner with HEICO, as they understand perfectly how to allow successful businesses like MMS to thrive under existing management.  HEICO shares our commitment to excellent customer service through superior designs and fast turn times, so we know our customers and Team Members will continue to be well served."

	Laurans A. Mendelson, HEICO's Chairman and CEO, along with Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-Presidents, remarked, "MMS expands HEICO's intelligence gathering equipment businesses and perfectly matches with HEICO—it makes difficult to design and unique devices, it's focused on customer satisfaction and growth and, most important, it has a top-notch and committed management team.  Phil Rezin's, Steve Wilson's and Mike Horn's desire to retain significant ownership shows one of the many reasons we have so much confidence in them. We look forward to a long and fruitful future together."

ASTROSEAL MANUFACTURING CORP.

	HEICO's Flight Support Group acquired Astroseal Products Manufacturing Corp. ("Astroseal").  Astroseal makes expanded foil mesh which is integrated into composite aerospace structures for lightning strike protection in fixed and rotary wing aircraft. Nearly all aircraft make use of composites needing Astroseal's "Astrostrike"® products for both shielding and lightning protection on large areas of the fuselage, wings, empennage, stabilizers, engine nacelles, propellers, winglets and the rotor blades.

	Composite materials are increasingly used in aviation applications, and expanded foil mesh is the most widely used technology to protect composite structures when struck by lightning.  HEICO has significantly grown its composite components operations over the past 2 ½ years through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. 

	Founded in 1965, Astroseal is located in Chester, CT. Most of Astroseal's staff will remain in place after the acquisition and HEICO does not anticipate any changes to Astroseal's quality, customer relationships, name or location. 

	Laurans A. Mendelson, Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson together remarked, "We are impressed with the technical accomplishments of Ken Grass and his team, as well as the breadth of composite manufacturers' approvals obtained by Astroseal.  Astroseal augments HEICO Flight Support group's expanding offering of aerospace composite products." 

	Ken Grass and Deb Grass, Astroseal's former owners, commented, "Having HEICO, a first class quality company, as our preferred acquirer delivers to us a high degree of comfort for the future growth of our Astrostrike® products.  The outstanding professionalism of the HEICO team, along with their strong core values provides us with great confidence for the future of both our customers and our employees.  We could not imagine a better steward for the future of our company than HEICO."

	HEICO Corporation is engaged primarily in certain niche segments of the aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries through its Hollywood, FL-based Flight Support Group and its Miami, FL-based Electronic Technologies Group.  HEICO's customers include a majority of the world's airlines and overhaul shops, as well as numerous commercial aircraft, defense, and space contractors and military agencies worldwide, in addition to medical, telecommunications and electronics equipment manufacturers.  For more information about HEICO, please visit our web site at http://www.heico.com.
