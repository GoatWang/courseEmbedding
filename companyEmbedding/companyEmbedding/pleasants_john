HALL PLEASANTS PAPERS MS. 194 Maryland Historical Society Baltimore MD 21201-4674 by Melinda K. Friend Maryland Historical Society Baltimore, Maryland November, 1991 WHAT PLEASANTS FILE DOES NOT DO: does not prove that a particular painting is of a certain subject, by a certain artist, of a certain date, was owned by a certain owner, was in Maryland at a certain time, or ever even existed; does not include all paintings ever done in Maryland, of Maryland subjects, by Maryland artists, or owned in Maryland at any particular time    Biographical Sketches  Jacob Hall Pleasants, M.D. (1873-1957) Jacob Hall Pleasants was born 12 September 1873 near Towson, Maryland, the youngest child of Richard Hall Pleasants and Elizabeth Moale (Poultney) Pleasants. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1895. Four years later, Pleasants obtained his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University and practiced medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, until he contracted a slight case of tuberculosis. Later, Dr. Pleasants taught diagnosis to medical students at Hopkins until his retirement in 1934. His interests were varied and included education, historical research, and fine arts. Pleasants served as a trustee for Johns Hopkins University, the Peabody Institute, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Gilmor Country School, and the Peale Museum. He was the president of the Supervisors of City Charities in Baltimore from 1904-1921. As a member of the Maryland Historical Society since 1898, J. Hall had been the corresponding secretary and the vice president. He wrote several books including The Curzon Family of New York and Baltimore, (1919); Maryland Silversmiths, 1715-1830, (1930) with Howard Sill; An Early Baltimore Negro Portrait Painter, Joshua Johnson, (1939); and acted as editor of the Archieves of Maryland series from 1929-44. In addition, Dr. Pleasants compiled the Pleasants File, a file on paintings existing in Maryland during the 1920s and 1930s. J. Hall Pleasants married Delia Tudor Wilmer, daughter of Skipwith Wilmer, in 1902 and fathered three children. He died on 24 August 1957 after failing to recover from surgery. Judith Carter (Armistead) Riddell (1774-1863) Judith Carter Armistead was born 29 December 1774 to William and Maria (Carter) Armistead at Hesse, the family estate in Gloucester County [now Matthews County], Virginia. She married Baltimore, Maryland attorney Richard Halton Moale in 1797 and bore him three sons, John Carter, William Armistead, and Richard Henry. After Mr. Moale's death, Judith wedded Robert Riddell on 6 January 1807. He died two years later. It was during this second widowhood that the house at 11 East Pleasants Street was constructed under the supervision of her brother-in-law, John Pemberton Pleasants. On 21 August 1813, Judith married Richard Carroll who died in 1832. She died on 13 January 1863. Samuel Pleasants (1737-1807) Samuel Pleasants was born at Curles, Henrico County, Virginia, in October, 1737, the son of a Quaker planter, John Pleasants, and his first wife, Margaret (Jordan) Pleasants. At the age of twenty five, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, established himself as a merchant, and married Mary Pemberton who bore him ten children. Samuel and Mary had their country home on School [House] Lane in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Persecuted during the American Revolution and branded a Tory for his refusal to pay war taxes, Pleasants was arrested with other Quakers by order of the Supreme Executive Council in September, 1777. This group of men became known as the Virginia Exiles because of their eventual transportation to Winchester, Virginia. Later, the Quakers were permitted to return to a British-occupied Philadelphia in the spring of 1778. In business, Pleasants was a successful merchant and often helped his sons, Israel and John Pemberton, with their ventures in Baltimore, Maryland, and elsewhere. He even sold some of his lands to pay off the debts owed by the Israel and John P. Pleasants company when it went bankrupt in 1805. In addition, Samuel Pleasants served as the manager of the Pennsylvania Hospital from 1779-1781. He died on 2 November 1807. Israel Pleasants (1764-1843) Israel Pleasants was born 20 May 1764 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Samuel and Mary (Pemberton) Pleasants. He served as the president of the United States Insurance Company of Philadelphia and like his father served a term as the manager of the Pennsylvania Hospital, 1796-1800. Israel became a successful merchant in Philadelphia, but ca. 1785 removed to Baltimore, Maryland, where by 1802 he had established the Israel and John P. Pleasants Company with his brother, John Pemberton. The brothers, who mostly traded in tobacco and ginseng, went bankrupt, however, in 1805. Israel then moved his family to Northumberland, Pennsylvania, and set up another mercantile firm which he ran for a number of years. The remainder of his years was spent in Philadelphia and he died there on 26 June 1843. He married Anne Paschall Franklin on 6 February 1788. Their marriage produced fourteen children. Mrs. Pleasants preceded her husband in death on 9 July 1822. John Pemberton Pleasants (1766-1825) John Pemberton Pleasants was born 16 April 1766 in Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, the second son of Samuel Pleasants and Mary (Pemberton) Pleasants. He wedded his first wife, Anne Cleves Armistead of Hesse, Matthews County, Virginia, on 14 March 1793. His marriage to a woman not of the Quaker faith may have been the reason Pleasants became a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Anne Pleasants died on 9 June 1801 leaving her husband with four children. Secondly, on 19 May 1816, Mr. Pleasants married Mary Hall of Harford County, Maryland, who bore him nine children. Following his brother Israel, John P. Pleasants came to Baltimore, Maryland, ca. 1785, and helped to establish the Israel and John P. Pleasants Company, a mercantile business engaged in the tobacco and mercantile trade. Their business, however, went bankrupt in 1805. Israel returned to Pennsylvania, but John remained and established the John P. Pleasants Company which later became John P. Pleasants and Sons. Mr. Pleasants lived at 334 St. Paul Street in Baltimore. He died 6 August 1825. His second wife preceded him in death in 1824. William Armistead Pleasants (1793-1849) William Armistead Pleasants was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on 8 December 1793 to John Pemberton and Anne Cleves (Armistead) Pleasants. He worked as a merchant in his father's firm of John P. Pleasants Company, a business that later became John P. Pleasants and Sons. William took charge of the firm in 1825 at the elder Pleasants' death. In 1833, Pleasants wedded Elizabeth Clopper who bore him one child, Anne Cleves Pleasants. The family resided at 74 Greene Street in Baltimore City. William died on 27 November 1849. Thomas Taylor Byrd (1752-1821) John Carter Byrd (1787-1814) Francis Otway Byrd (1790-1860) Thomas Taylor Byrd was born at Westover on the James River, Charles City County, Virginia, on 7 January 1752, the second son of Col. William Byrd III and his first wife, Elizabeth Hill (Carter) Byrd. He served in the British Army throughout the Revolutionary War, and under the leadership of Col. Fanning rose to the rank of captain. On 19 October 1781, Thomas surrendered at Yorktown and removed to England. He returned to the United States in late 1785 or early 1786, and on 13 March 1786, married Mary Anne Armistead (1766-1824), the daughter of William and Maria (Carter) Armistead of Hesse, Gloucester County, Virginia. Thomas's death occurred on 19 August 1821 and that of his wife on 12 October 1824 at their residence, The Cottage, in Frederick County (now Clarke County), Virginia. Thomas and Mary Anne's eldest son, John Carter Byrd, was born in 1787. He served as an officer for the United States in the War of 1812 and met his death on 14 September 1814 at the Battle of North Point. Col. Francis Otway Byrd, the third son of Thomas and Mary Anne, was born on 20 August 1790. He served with distinction at Tripoli under Gen. William Eaton in 1804 and in the Niagra campaign of 1814 under Maj.-Gen. Gaines. Francis also fought against the Algierians under Commodore Decatur and captured an Algierian frigate for which he received a Turkish sword and a pair of Algierian pistols. In 1817, the colonel married Elizabeth Rhoades Pleasants (1793-1880), daughter of Israel and Anne Paschall (Franklin) Pleasants of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They resided at Oakley in Clarke County, Virginia. Francis Otway Byrd moved to Baltimore in 1855 and died there on 2 May 1860. Elizabeth died on 25 July 1880. William McMechen (1772-1832) Eleanor Bowles (Armistead) McMechen (1778-1858) William McMechen was born on 28 December 1772 in Augusta County, Virginia, [near the present town of McMechen, Marshall County, West Virginia] the eldest son of Captain William McMechen and his second wife, Sydney (Johnson) McMechen. He moved to Baltimore, Maryland, to live with his half-brother, David, a successful attorney, and by 1799 had joined the elder McMechen's law practice on Calvert Street. At his brother's death in 1810, William inherited Pot Spring, the Baltimore County estate purchased by David, ca. 1787. In 1818-19, McMechen obtained an appointment as judge of the criminal courts. Later, he became an associate justice of the Baltimore City Court and held that position until his death. On 21 February 1800, William married Eleanor Ellen Bowles Armistead who was born in 1778, the youngest child of William and Maria (Carter) Armistead of Hesse, Gloucester County, Virginia. The McMechen's raised seven children, Sydney Jane, Ellen Bowles, Maria C., David, Charles Carter, William Armistead, and Margaret, at their Fayette Street home. Summers, however, were spent at Pot Spring. Mr. McMechen died on 4 November 1832 and his wife in 1858. He was buried on his country estate, but at its sale was reinterred at Green Mount cemetery. Thomas Poultney (1762-1828) Thomas Poultney was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on 29 September 1762, the son of Quakers Thomas Poultney (1718-1800), who emigrated from England in 1730, and his second wife, Elizabeth (Smith) Stockton Poultney. In 1789, Thomas (1762-1828) moved to Alexandria, Virginia, and in 1791 came to Baltimore, Maryland. He established the Poultney and Thomas Company of 162 West Baltimore Street in 1807, a mercantile firm that operated until 1815. Poultney then started another hardware-trading company, Thomas Poultney and Sons, with sons Evan, Samuel, and Philip. This firm was dissolved on 1 January 1829. He took Ann Thomas as his bride on 21 April 1790. By age forty-five, Thomas had amassed a considerable fortune and later owned a home at 5 St. Paul Street in Baltimore City. The Poultney's and their eleven children spent summers at Mount Airy, a Baltimore County estate purchased from the Lux family in 1815. The children would later build their own cottages on the estate giving rise to a Poultney village. Mr. Poultney died on 25 December 1828. He was sixty-six years of age. His wife died 4 February 1858. Evan Thomas Poultney (1793-1838) Evan T. Poultney was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1793, the eldest son of Quakers Thomas and Ann (Thomas) Poultney. In his youth, he lived at 5 St. Paul Street and spent summers at the family summer residence of Mount Airy in Baltimore County. Poultney first entered the business world in his father's mercantile firm, Thomas Poultney and Sons. He later became a private banker and opened Evan Poultney and Company from 1829-32. About 1832, Evan became president of the Bank of Maryland and ended his private banking career. That same year, he also established a partnership with several other men in the stocks and profits of the Bank of Maryland. Evan and his family's firm, Poultney, Ellicott and Company, were responsible for the closing on 22 March 1834 of the Bank of Maryland and the subsequent Baltimore banking panic of 1834. The failure of this bank led to the trial and conviction of Evan, Samuel, and Philip Poultney as well as their brother-in-law, William Miller Ellicott, at the Harford County Court in 1837. On 25 September 1823, Evan married Jane Tunis in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They raised three children, Ann, Thomas, and Jane at their residence on the corner of Fayette and Charles Streets in Baltimore City. The Poultneys also had built a cottage on the Mount Airy estate. Mr. Poultney died on 19 November 1838 and Bel Air in Harford County, Maryland. Samuel Thomas Poultney (1797-1864) Samuel T. Poultney was born in Baltimore, Maryland, 16 June 1797, the second son of Quakers Thomas and Ann (Thomas) Poultney. On 20 September 1828, he married Ellin Moale Curson, daughter of Richard Curson, Jr., who bore his six children. Their residence on Mulberry Street was one of the first homes in Baltimore to have gas lights and a furnace. Mr. Poultney and family summered at their cottage on his father's Baltimore County estate, Mount Airy. Like his brother Evan, Samuel probably first entered into business in his father's mercantile firm, Thomas Poultney and Sons. Samuel, however, continued to operate as a hardware and cutlery importer two years after the 1 January 1829 dissolution of his father's company. Along with brother-in-law William Miller Ellicott, Samuel reorganized Evan's old financial house of Evan Poultney and Company and created his own under the name of Poultney, Ellicott, and Company in July, 1832. This banking house played a major roll in the securities speculation that caused the Bank of Maryland to close its doors on 22 March 1834, an event followed by the Baltimore panic of 1834. Samuel, Evan, and Philip Poultney along with William Ellicott were tried for their mismanagement in several cases at the Harford County Court from 1836-37. Later, Samuel became a commission merchant with an office on Lombard Street. Mr. Poultney died on 27 August 1864. Ellin M. Poultney died on 5 December 1880. William Miller Ellicott (1807-ca. 1898) William M. Ellicott was born 30 September 1807, the only son of Quakers Thomas Ellicott, president of the Union Bank of Maryland, and Mary (Miller) Ellicott. His birth may have occurred in Chester County, Pennsylvania, on his mother's inherited property called Avondale, part of a 12,000-acre land grant from William Penn. In July, 1832, William, along with Samuel Poultney, established the Baltimore banking house of Poultney, Ellicott and Company. These two men and other speculators, however, sought to dissolve their partnership in 1835 after their speculation in the Bank of Maryland caused that institution to close its doors on 22 March 1834. In several cases from 1836-37, William and Samuel, Evan, and Philip Poultney were tried in the Harford County Court for their role in the bank's closing. At the August, 1837, term of that court, Ellicott and Samuel Poultney were found guilty by default and ordered to pay the bank $348,522.48. Later, William became a commission merchant at 3 Spear's Wharf. His sons, Thomas P., David B., and Charles L, joined him in that business. On 11 November 1829, Ellicott married Sarah Cresson Poultney, daughter of Thomas and Ann (Thomas) Poultney, at the Friends Meeting House on Lombard Street. The Ellicotts raised eight children and resided at their estate, Montrose, in Baltimore County, Maryland. Mr. Ellicott died ca. 1898. Richard Curson of Richmond (1698-1784) Richard Curson, the youngest child of Samuel Curson II (the first person to change his name from Curzon to Curson) and his wife, Susanna, was baptized 1 September 1698 at St. Dunstan's-in-the-West parish, London, England. He lived an unmarried life at Richmond, Surrey, on the outskirts of London and amassed a large fortune of L60,000 to L70,000 as a wine merchant. Mr. Curson died at his home on 16 April 1784, leaving the majority of his real estate to his nephew, John Curson of Ipswich. John Curson of Ipswich (1715-1793) John Curson was born in England ca. 1715, the second child of Samuel Curson III, a wine merchant, and his wife, Rebecca (Clark) Curson. He resided in Ipswich and first married Charlotte Torriano who died on 4 November 1764. The following year on 4 April, John wedded Jane Milner. She died on 6 September 1788 at Puddington. His first inheritance came in 1759 at his father's death and consisted of some houses in and around London. Then, in 1784, Curson was left the bulk of the Richard Curson of Richmond estate: real estate of ten or more pieces in London and Richmond worth approximately L30,000 and joint three-percent annuities in the Consolidated Bank [of England] valued at L4,000. At his death on 27 July 1793 at Blanford, Dorset, John bequested the bank annuities to his brother, Richard Curson, Sr., who had immigrated to America. All of John's freehold and lease properties were give to Mrs. Elizabeth Wood of Annwell, Herts, who had cared for him. Upon her death, the properties were to revert to Richard. Mrs. Wood, however, did not die until 14 October 1813, eight years after Richard's death. Richard Curson, Sr. (1726-1805) Richard Curson was born on 14 November 1726 in England to Samuel Curson III, a wine merchant, and his wife, Rebecca (Clark) Curson. He immigrated to New York City in 1747 and on 2 December wedded Elizabeth Rebecca Becker (1731-), daughter of Frederick and Catherina Becker. The Curson's left New York on 20 June 1776 to avoid possible capture by the British, a fate they desparately sought to escape because of their sympathy for the revolution. By June, 1777, they had arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, where Richard established the mercantile firm of Richard Curson and Company and used his ships as privateers to run the British blockade. In 1793, Richard Sr., inherited bank annuities and real estate from his uncle, John Curson of Ipswich. He mortgaged his interest in the estate for about L3,000, however, to Effingham Lawrence of London. A man of high social standing, Richard was intimate with Thomas Jefferson, Light Horse Harry Lee, and Daniel Dulany. He and his family resided at 20 Light Street, but Richard moved to 22 Light Street when his house burned on 4 December 1796. By 1803, Curson had retired from business and was residing on German Street with his son, Richard, Jr. He died on 8 July 1805, intestate, and was buried at Old St. Paul's churchyard. Samuel Vincent served as the administrator of his estate. Samuel Curson (ca. 1763-1786) Samuel Curson was born in New York ca. 1763, the second child and eldest son of Richard Curson, Sr., a merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (Becker) Curson. He first became associated with business in his father's mercantile firm of Curson and Seton. Because of his sympathy for the revolution, Samuel had moved to St. Eustatius in the Dutch West Indies by March, 1776, and established a mercantile company, Curson and Gouveneur, with Isaac Gouveneur, Jr. Four years later, he returned to New York while Gouveneur remained in St. Eustatius. In 1784, Richard Curson of Richmond left L3,000 to his grandnephew, who used the money to travel extensively in Europe and England. The Curson and Gouveneur partnership was dissolved on 31 May 1785 possibly because of a difference between the two men or their ailing health. In July, 1785, Samuel had established his own business in New York, but continued to pay off debts owed by Curson and Gouveneur. Curson's death occurred on 24 April 1786 from wounds received in a duel on 21 April. Supposedly, he was killed by [Walter] Burling of Baltimore, Maryland, who accused Curson of fathering the illegitimate son of Burling's sister, Betsey. Betsey [Burling] had married Richard John Whittell of England, a first cousin of Samuel, but wanted a financial settlement from Samuel and the Cursons who denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Burling apparently pursued Samuel from the West Indies to London and finally to America. In New York, Burling challenged Curson to a duel in which Curson was wounded. Samuel died after three days and and was interred at Trinity Church, New York. It is conjectured that Curson was in fact slain by Whittell using the alias of Walter Burling. From the letters between Samuel and his father, it appeared that Whittell, then living in Baltimore, had tried to blackmail the Curson family. Richard Curson, Jr. (1763-1808) Richard Curson, Jr., was born on 1 July 1763 in New York, the second son of Richard Curson, Sr., a merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth (Becker) Curson. He came to Baltimore, Maryland, ca. 1777 with his father. Seven years later on 13 March at St. Paul's Church, he took Elizabeth Moale, daughter of Col. John Moale, as his bride. The Curson's had four children, but only raised three to maturity. They resided probably with Richard, Sr., at his 20 Light Street address until ca. 1803 when the junior Cursons moved to German Street. Later, Richard, Jr., and his family moved to Greene Street. By 1785, Richard had joined his father's mercantile business of Richard Curson and Company. He retired from business ca. 1804 probably because of his ailing health and a spinal disease developed in early childhood. The papers and ledgers of his business were lost in the flood of 1819 while they were at the accountant's office on Harrison Street in Baltimore. On 14 September 1806, by a decree of the Chancery Court of Maryland, Richard was declared a lunatic by means of debility. The custody and care of his person and property were given to Ebenezer Finlay and by a subsequent order dated 25 October 1806 to Samuel Vincent, who administered the estate for Curson and his wife. Richard, Jr., never really controlled the Curson estates in England because his father died intestate in 1805 and because he was declared a lunatic. Richard died on 14 June 1808 and was buried at St. Paul's churchyard in Baltimore. His wife died on 26 November 1822 and was interred at St. Thomas cemetery. Richard Carroll (1775-1832) Richard Carroll was born in 1775 to Daniel Carroll and his wife, Rachael (Croxall) Carroll, probably at the family estate of Mount Dillon in Baltimore County, Maryland. He spent his life as a gentleman of means and sometimes administered the estates of wealthy families. On 21 August 1813, Richard married Mrs. Judith Carter (Armistead) Riddell with whom he lived at 11 Pleasants Street in Baltimore City. He died on 24 August 1832. In 1820, Richard, an uncle by marriage to Elizabeth R.B. and Ellin M. Curson, was asked to become an agent for his nieces in their effort to obtain their English inheritance. The diligence of Ellin together with Carroll's repeated letter writing and his connections in England gained the young women the Curson English estates located in the London area. By 1826, the daughters of Richard Curson, Jr., had obtained approximately L20,000 from the sale of the property after the outstanding debts were paid.    Scope and Content  The J. Hall Pleasants Papers, MS. 194, consist of nine series of family and business documents which span the years 1773-1957: Dr. J[acob] Hall Pleasants Correspondence and Notes, Riddell House Papers, Pleasants Business Papers, William and Eleanor Bowles McMechen Papers, Poultney Papers, Curson Papers, George-Ellicott-Tyson Correspondence, Dr. Stedman R. Tilghman Scrapbook, and the A[ndrew]J.H. Way Scrapbook. Series I contains the papers, 1897-1957, of Dr. J[acob] Hall Pleasants dealing with three publications on which he worked, Archives of Maryland, Maryland Silversmiths, 1715-1830, and possibly Maryland History Bibliography; his genealogical research; and the Pleasants File. The Archives of Maryland, a series of volumes composed of transcriptions of early Maryland records written prior to the acknowledgement of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, was printed by the Maryland Historical Society in compliance with Chapter 138, Laws of Maryland, January Session, 1882. This law required the society to agree to print historically significant state documents in order for all pre-Revolutionary Maryland records to be transferred to their care. The printing of these documents, therefore, became an ongoing project and on 17 February 1909, Clayton C. Hall, chairman of the Committee on Publications of the society, sent a circular letter to various libraries asking if their collections contained any original Maryland session laws passed before the American Revolution from which a transcription could be made. The responses from the libraries to Hall's inquiry and to the same question asked by Bernard C. Steiner, editor of the Archives, in 1917, by J. Appleton Wilson, corresponding secretary of the society, in 1924, and from 1921-29 by J. Hall Pleasants, a later editor of the Archives, comprise the correspondence relating to this voluminous series. An undated copy of one of the circular letters also appears in this section. In addition, there is a list of pre-Revolutionary Maryland laws and proceedings. Silversmiths, a joint venture with Howard Sill who died before the book's publication in 1930, compiles information on known silversmiths operating in early Maryland. Pleasants began his research for this successful volume by making a survey of Maryland silver and its crafters. A majority of the correspondence, 1920-40, therefore, was either responses to letters of inquiry sent by Dr. Pleasants to persons in possession of Maryland silver or responses from persons who had information on early Maryland silversmiths (i.e. where in Maryland they worked, during what years, biographical information, and hallmarks). The three most prolific correspondents were Alfred C. Prime of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Francis Hill Bigelow of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Lawrence C. Wroth of the John Carter Brown Library, Providence, Rhode Island. In October, 1930, silver enthusiasts began requesting copies of the volume. The remainder of the items concerning Silversmiths included three folders of research notes, the copyright registration, magazine advertisements, reviews of the volume, a list of purchasers of the book, newspaper articles, and some photographs of Maryland silver. Later, 1952-56, Pleasants received letters from persons seeking his help in identifying the maker of their silver. Before his death on 24 August 1957, Dr. Pleasants might have been starting to gather information for a new publication as suggested by a small notebook entitled Maryland History Bibliography. A date of 15 September 1957, however, twenty-two days after Pleasants' death, also occurred in the notebook. Another interest of Dr. Pleasants's was genealogy. He kept three notebooks containing information on the Redgrave, Gittings, Owings, and Wilmont families, the first two compiled in 1897 and the latter ca. 1915. Along with the volumes, Pleasants maintained additional genealogical notes on these families and those of Pleasants, Goldsmith, Collett, Utie, Wells, Garrettson, and Beedle. The correspondence, 1897-99, 1916-57, discusses the genealogies of the aforementioned families, Thomas Cramphin (1740-1830) who lived in Montgomery County, Maryland, and the ca. 1943 transcriptions of letters written by signers of the Declaration of Independence. These transcriptions are of letters held by various institutions and penned by Samuel Chase, Lyman Hall, Benjamin Franklin, William Ellery, Elias Woodruff, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Morris, and William Hooper. Miscellaneous genealogical items include a printed chart of the descendants of Walter de Curzon Poultney and a typescript of the memoir of John Carnan Tevis (1816-). A further group of notes and correspondence on various Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania families compiled by Dr. Pleasants was removed to the Reference Division and entitled, J. Hall Pleasants Collection, G. 5096. The Pleasants File, a compilation of data on paintings existing in Maryland during the 1920s and 1930s as researched by Dr. Pleasants, includes photographs and relevant information on subjects and artists for portraits, landscapes, etc. found in Maryland homes, courthouses, churches, and public and private institutions. No longer part of this collection, it has been removed to the chief curator's office. Those persons wishing to use the file must apply in advance and in writing to the chief curator stating what information they seek and the purpose of their research. Series II contains papers, 1810-12, relating to the building of the Riddell House (a.k.a. the Carroll House) at 11 East Pleasants Street, Baltimore, Maryland, for Judith Carter (Armistead) Riddell. She, the recent widow of Robert Riddell, had her affairs managed by her brother-in-law, John Pemberton Pleasants, who retained all bills and receipts for the construction of the house, everything from the cost and size of the marble stairs to the barrel of beer per week for the workers, as well as a complete accounting of the construction materials. Mrs. Riddell designed the structure, but the person who drew the floor plans and made the notes in the margins remains unknown. John Donaldson of Conowago Street worked as the carpenter and builder (known today as a contractor) of this Greek Revival row house. He estimated the cost in 1810 at $8,207.00, but the final cost in 1812 came to $14,877.94 mainly because Mrs. Riddell wanted the best items and materials of the day for her house. The CandP Telephone Company razed the structure ca. 1930 in order to make way for the building of their offices, but the entrance and an interior hallway arch have been preserved at the Baltimore Museum of Art. Series III, Pleasants Business Papers, 1787-1854, contains the records of seven Pleasants family businesses. These papers constitute the bulk of this collection and are divided into seven subseries: correspondence, checks and promissory notes, company accounts and papers, estate of John P. Pleasants, legal proceedings, land papers, and the Byrd family papers. Their first business, Samuel Pleasants and Sons, a mercantile firm located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, operated from ca. 1787 until 1804 when the partnership with sons John Pemberton and Israel was dissolved. Documents relating to this company span the years 1787-1805. Secondly, brothers John and Robert Pleasants managed the Baltimore, Maryland, mercantile firm of John and Robert Pleasants and Company, ca. 1792-99, while John was also a member of his father's Philadelphia concern. Papers relating to this partnership cover the years 1792-99. Later, John established his own Baltimore mercantile house at 197 Baltimore Street, John P. Pleasants and Company, which operated ca. 1797-1801. Documents relating to this business span the years 1797-1813. During this time, Israel also engaged in his own Philadelphia and Baltimore concern, Israel Pleasants and Company, ca. 1798-1801. Records for this company cover the years 1798-1804. In 1802, according to the Baltimore City Directory, Israel and John established the wholesale dry goods business of Israel and John P. Pleasants at 197 Baltimore Street. The two brothers were involved extensively in the tobacco and ginseng trade. Their business went bankrupt, however, in 1805 and was dissolved in 1806 because of poor management and lack of payments from their debtors. Papers relating to this company span the years 1798-1837. After the bankruptcy, Israel returned to Philadelphia, but John remained in Baltimore and became a commission merchant. In 1810, he established the John P. Pleasants Company at 10 South Charles Street which later relocated to 8 Light Street Wharf. Documents for this company cover the years 1811-23. By 1817, however, the name of the business had become John P. Pleasants and Sons when sons William A. and John Pemberton (a.k.a. Pemberton) joined the firm followed later by sons Jacob and Richard. William headed the company after his father's death in 1825 and Richard succeeded at William's death in 1849. John P. Pleasants and Sons was dissolved in 1905, the longest-running business in Baltimore at that time. Records for this firm span the years 1815-39. The correspondence, consisting of incoming and outgoing business letters and some general mail, 1789-1854, contains a wealth of information on the aforementioned Pleasants family companies. Business accounts often appear inside the letters which are sometimes in duplicate or triplicate. The practice of sending copies of a single letter on different ships to insure that at least one copy would reach its destination was widely used because of the unreliability of the mails. Early incoming business letters deal with the Israel and John P. Pleasants Company whose creditors, including their father, Samuel, and brothers, Charles, Joseph, Robert, and James, request the money owed to them. By January, 1805, however, Israel and John realized that they could not pay their company's bills. Their brothers became angered at this announcement and worried if their reputations would be affected by the business failure of Israel and John. In fact, some letters sent to Baltimore by the brothers and the father were malicious and accused Israel and John of willful deception. Their father, who owned vast tracts of land in Virginia and Kentucky, however, offered them in his letter of 15 January 1805, 50,000 acres to use in payment to their other creditors if they assigned him $25,000 in good debts. Then the good debts would be payment for the money owed Samuel by the Israel Pleasants Company. Israel and John accepted this agreement. The creditors, however, especially the English ones, were not satisfied with this arrangement because tracts of land in the wilds of Kentucky and Virginia were useless to them and because they had carried the Pleasants's debts for a number of months. Later, all of the creditors agreed to the terms of exchanging land for money, etc., letter dated 1 March 1805, except for the Tunno and Loughnan Company and the Relph and Todhunters Company of England. From 1803-1813, Henry Garrett of Dunkirk, [Maryland,] served as an agent for the Israel and John P. Pleasants Company in recovering the money due them by Virginia debtors. In addition, Garrett oversaw the prosecution of lawsuits against these debotrs and reported the progression and final outcome of the cases to Israel and John Pleasants. Thomas C. Hoomes of King and Queen Courthouse, Virginia, acted as the attorney in these trials. The litigants included John Mandeville, Mr. Baytop, Mr. Throckmorton, and Benjamin Reeder, among others. A complete history of the Mandeville v. Gibson case is recounted in the letter from T[homas] B[.] Barton to John Pleasants dated 7 September 1820. Edmund J. Lee also helped with the 1813 suit against Mandeville. In 1817, Archibald R. Taylor of Fredericksburg, Virginia, succeeded Mr. Garrett as the agent for this defunct company. He gathered information for legal cases, reported the progress and outcome of these litigations, collected debts, and also quoted prices for tobacco, wheat, and flour in his letters to John Pleasants. Mr. Taylor moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1822, but continued as their agent until 1825. A majority of the incoming correspondence written between the years 1817-25 was penned by him and concerned the aforementioned topics. The Pleasants's and their agents continue to discuss Virginia and Kentucky court cases and their outcomes in the correspondence from 1820-23. More information on the Mandeville v. Gibson case is presented in the letters of 6 June and 21 July 1821. While in Virginia, William Pleasants wrote three letters in October, 1823, to his father concerning his effort to gather information for a court case. The Pleasants's trade with English merchants had been interrupted by a series of federal commerce regulations which forbade trade with Great Britain and France: the Non-Importation Act of 1806, the Embargo Act of 1807, and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809. On 1 May 1810, Macon Bill, No. 2, once again restored trade between the United States and the two combatants, Great Britain and France, but only if these two countries repealed their similar decrees against the United States. Napoleon, however, by failing to return sequestered American vessels, using the permit system, and imposing high tariffs, caused President Madison to act in accordance with the Macon Bill and proclaim on 2 November 1810 that non-intercourse with England and France would again take effect on 1 February 1811. In a letter dated 6 February 1811 to Wallis and Lloyd of Birmingham, England, G.F. and J. Lindberger of Baltimore expressed concern as to whether British goods could be shipped to America in the fall. Products traded with England included tobacco, ginseng, buttons, and umbrella furniture (parts). American merchants were not in favor of non-intercourse because they already suffered financially from the ban on commerce with England. Congress, therefore, accepted John W. Eppes' amendment to the Foreign Relations Committee bill that would allow trade with England if they repealed their Orders in Council. Until that time, however, the 2 March 1811 Non-Importation Act against the British would be in effect. On 23 June 1812, Great Britain repealed their orders of November, 1807, and April, 1809, but the Congress had already declared war on England on 18 June because of their impressment of American sailors and seizure of American vessels. Therefore, the trade between America and England continued to be interrupted by a new disagreement, the War of 1812, which did not officially end until the U.S. Senate ratified the Treaty of Ghent on 17 February 1815. Correspondence between the Pleasants's and English firms began anew in 1814. In October, John P. Pleasants became an agent for Joseph Wallis and Company of Birmingham, England, when he took over the management of their American accounts from his brother, Charles Pleasants. Throughout 1815, John debated with Wallis the problem of who would bear the loss if goods shipped from England to the United States by Joseph Wallis and Company in the face of the non importation Law of the U.S. were confiscated. In addition, Wallis addressed Pleasants on 25 July 1815 about the probability of an increase in the prices of mercantile products because of Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat and capture by the British. Letters from Joseph Wallis span the years, 1814-18. On 7 October 1818, John received a letter from Wallis's brother, William, explaining Joseph's mismanagement of the company money and the resulting June dissolution of Joseph Wallis and Company. Then, in early 1819, G[eorge] W[ashington] Wallis of New York, son of William, along with Edward J. Canning obtained the power of attorney for this defunct company in order to recoup any losses and pay off outstanding debts. George wrote a large body of correspondence during 1819 concerning the business to Pleasants, the company's former agent, who also owed Joseph Wallis and Company $3,567.12. From 1824-25, Charles Pleasants, living in Philadelphia, wrote frequently to his older brother, John, concerning John's speculation in Pennsylvania coal lands with Joseph Lyon of Lehighton, Pennsylvania. Lyon, a man whom Charles considered untrustworthy because of his past business failures, conducted his communications with John through Charles. Dr. Horace H. Hayden, a Baltimore dentist and the first person to publish a book in America on geology, was also involved in this speculation as an investor and reputed geologist. As Charles had suspected, however, Lyon's negotiations failed to secure the tract of land the men wanted. Lyon then proposed various options for the recovery of the two gentlemen's investment, but finally decided to buy a coal field on Short Mountain in Pennsylvania from which profits would be used to repay Pleasants and Hayden. This venture, however, also failed and a settlement was made by Charles Pleasants for his brother with Charles Bird, Lyon's business partner. Lyon released Dr. Hayden and John Pleasants from any agreements with him on 5 May 1825, a copy of which is in the papers. Incoming business correspondence for the years 1826-28 came addressed to John P. Pleasants and Sons and later after John's death to his son, William, as the head of the firm. The correspondence for the years 1829-36 is not contained within this collection. A letter written to William Pleasants from W[illia]m F. Peterson on 29 November 1837 acknowledging the receipt of documents concerning lands in Cabell County, Virginia, owned by Israel and John Pleasants, et.al. represents the last incoming correspondence during William's tenure. The outgoing business correspondence, 1802-08, comprised of letters written by John and Israel Pleasants, concerns rectifying accounts, getting money from debtors, obtaining counsel for a suit brought against them by John Tunno of London in 1804, and the terms of paying off their debts. The actual terms of payment to their creditors and a description of the lands to be used are in a letter dated 31 March 1805. In two drafts of a letter to Andrew Ellicott (in oversize), Israel and John explain what caused their business to fail. The petition to the Maryland Assembly mentioned in this letter is housed with the company accounts and papers. Correspondence for the years 1809-19 does not reside in this collection. From 1820-37, the outgoing letters contain information about the Joseph Wallis and Company accounts and the opinion of John Purviance, a Baltimore attorney, as to whether a partnership ever existed between Joseph and his brother, William Wallis. (A copy of this 1820 opinion is in the company accounts and papers section). Other topics include the collection of debts owed the estate of the N. Norris and Brooke Company, Joseph Lyon, and other John P. Pleasants and Sons business. The final letter dated 20 December 1837 is William Pleasants's response to William Peterson. General correspondence contains a letter dated 1792 from G.S. to John Lagart concerning a disreputable Balitmore woman; two letters dated 1799 from Tench [UNK] to R. H. Moale about land deeds; and an 1804 letter discussing family news from Mary (Armistead) Byrd to her brother-in-law, John P. Pleasants. The last letter, dated 4 September 1854, was written by an acting midshipman from Queen Anne's County, Maryland, William van Wyck (1824-1854), while he served as a caterer on board the U.S. brig Porpoise anchored at Hong Kong. This ship along with the U.S. sloop of war Vincennes, U.S. storeship John P. Kennedy, U.S. steam propeller John Hancock, and the U.S. tender Fenimore Cooper comprised the U.S. Surveying Expedition to the North Pacific Ocean commanded by Commodore Cadwalader Ringgold. In his letter, van Wyck commented on fellow officers, other vessels in the expedition, and his trip to Canton, China, where Chinese rebels were holding forts after the first Opium War with the British, 1839-42. In addition, he described his visit to a duck factory in Fah-Ty, a Buddhist temple and monastery at Honam, the Chinese practice of burning the dead, opium smoking, the inhumane execution of criminals, and the failure of Commodore Matthew C. Perry to negotiate a treaty with Japan. The Porpoise was last seen on 21 September 1854 between Formosa (now Taiwan) and China and assumed lost in a typhoon. The next section of the business papers contains the checks and promissory notes for the various Pleasants firms, 1797-1829. Some checks were drawn on the Office of Discount and Deposit or the Mechanics' Bank of Baltimore for the businesses while others were personal or paid by John P. Pleasants for other persons. All seven Pleasants companies are represented in the company accounts and papers subseries, 1787-1839, with the bulk of the information falling under the Israel and John P. Pleasants Company and John P. Pleasants. The records include the bankruptcy of Israel and John, the Joseph Wallis accounts, and Joseph Lyon's coal speculation, etc. with several accounts overlapping as one Pleasants company succeeds another. Some financial statements are penned inside of letters and therefore reside with the business correspondence while others are housed in the oversize section. The remaining items include unidentified company accounts and the accounts and receipts of miscellaneous persons not related to the companies, 1795-1903. Further accounts relate to the estate of John P. Pleasants, 1824-48, who died intestate on 6 August 1825. William, his son, was made the administrator on 1 September 1826 and in this capacity saved the vouchers, tax receipts, Orphans' Court orders, administrative accountings, a judgement, and the inventory of his father's estate. The Orphans' Court orders and administrative accountings contain references to the sale of a slave named Peggy. The Pleasants's participated in approximately twenty legal proceedings, usually to recover debts, in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Louisiana, from 1795-1828. Mandeville v. Gibson and Pleasants v. Baytop and Throckmorton were the largest cases. At that time, chancery courts heard and decided on litigation, a slow and arduous process. Testimony for these and other cases appears in the legal proceedings section with many references found in the business correspondence. Members of the Pleasants family held tracts of land in Virginia (mostly on the Mud River), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, South Carolina, and Kentucky with deeds dating from 1787-1850. Samuel Pleasants might have been a major land speculator as it was his vast tracts of land used to pay off the debts of Israel and John when their company went bankrupt in 1805. John held many properties in Baltimore City and County including lots on Primrose Alley, Market Street, Howard Street, Jones's Falls, and an area known as Betts Prosperity, 1794-1810. Other items in the land papers include a contemporary copy of the title dispute hearings in the case of Dr. William Hammond v. Charles Ridgely regarding Ridgely's Addition, 9 May 1787, and a deed for Lot 847 in Howard's Late Addition, 1835. The papers of the Byrd family constitute the final section of the Pleasants business papers. Capt. Thomas T. Byrd's vouchers reflected his recurrent business with Richard Benson, a Baltimore tailor, 1806-09. His son's, John Carter Byrd, vouchers covered payment for clothing, boots, boarding with James Kendall, and subscriptions to the Federal Register newspaper, 1806-15. The two [Francis] Otway Byrd vouchers were for two pair of pantaloons and a full dress uniform coat of the United States Artillery, 1811-12. Series IV contains the William and Eleanor Ellen Bowles McMechen papers, 1810-53, comprised of correspondence; receipts for legal fees, pew rents at St. Peter's, ground rents, house repairs, privy emptying, and five gallons of whiskey, 1821-53; an account with William A. Moale, 1835; and Ellen's 1833 bill of sale from Hannah Kilty Chase (Mrs. Samuel Chase) for a slave named William Drane. The remainder of the papers are their deeds to Baltimore City properties, 1820-50. The McMechens apparently allowed many of their lots to fall into disrepair which caused the city to proclaim the properties a public nuisance. Therefore, the McMechens would then rent out these properties to people for a few years with the condition that the renters would make repairs to the structure. One letter penned by William McMechen resides in the Pleasants incoming correspondence, 1827. Series V concerns the business papers of the Poultney family, 1807-69. Their first mercantile concern, Poultney and Thomas Company, founded by Thomas Poultney, appeared in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1807, at 162 West Baltimore Street. Documents for this firm span the years, 1807-27. The mercantile business then became Thomas Poultney and Sons (originally Thomas Poultney and Son), a hardware trading company, when sons Evan, Samuel, and Philip joined with their father. Their business lasted from 1815 until its dissolution on 1 January 1829. Items relating to this company cover the years, 1815-1830. Samuel, however, continued to operate as a hardware and cutlery importer at 164 West Baltimore Street for four years after the dissolution. Documents relating to this firm consist of promissory notes, 1831. Evan became a private banker and opened Evan Poultney and Company, 1829-32, at 162 West Baltimore Street, with financial help from Thomas Ellicott, then president of the Union Bank of Maryland. About 1832, Evan became president of the Bank of Maryland and ended his private banking career. His brother, Samuel, and brother-in-law, William Miller Ellicott, reorganized his old company into a new banking house, Poultney, Ellicott and Company, and added Philip as a member. Documents for Poultney, Ellicott, and Company cover the years, 1833-35. In 1832, Evan also established a partnership in the stocks and profits of the Bank of Maryland with Reverdy Johnson, John Glenn, David M. Perrine, Hugh McElderry and Evan T. Ellicott. Poultney served as president of the bank while Johnson, Glenn, and Ellicott acted as directors. Then Evan wanted to increase the note circulation of the Bank of Maryland, but the scheme required more specie. He, therefore, devised a plan of paying five-percent interest on deposits as a way to attract more money into the bank. In order to further increase circulation, Evan and the other speculators developed a chain of agencies over the United States through which the notes were moved. Evan Poultney and Company, and later Poultney, Ellicott and Company coordinated these agencies, a profitable arrangement for the banking houses and Evan Poultney. Disaster struck in the winter of 1833, however, when the Union Bank of Maryland stock that the speculators had purchased with money from the Bank of Maryland could not be sold at a profit. The speculators then decided to disband. On 22 March 1834, the Bank of Maryland closed, bringing about the Baltimore panic of 1834. Actually, the origins of the panic lay in the mismanagement and even fraudulent management and overextended condition of the Bank of Maryland. The paper expansion of this bank without adequate specie reserves was accomplished by its introduction of a banking novelty in Baltimore during the winter of 1831-32: paying interest on deposits.1 Samuel, Evan, and Philip Poultney as well as William M. Ellicott were tried for their mismanagement in several cases from 1836-37 at the Harford County Court in Bel Air, Maryland. At the August, 1837, term of that court in the case of The President and Directors of the Bank of Maryland v. Samuel Poultney and William M. Ellicott and Company, Poultney and Ellicott were found guilty by default and ordered to pay the bank $348,522.48. A majority of the business papers relate to the Poultney's demise after the Bank of Maryland closing in 1834: Samuel and Ellin (Curson) Poultney's papers re the Bank of Maryland, [ca. 1828-34]; Samuel's insolvency application and final discharge, 1834-44; list of Poultney, Ellicott and Company creditors, 1835; manuscript copy of the Poultney, Ellicott and Company dissolution, 30 March 1835; vouchers for court fees, 1836; and Samuel's bill of sale for his one-eighth interest in a ship called India, 19 July 1838. Other related items, Samuel Poultney's deed of chattels to Samuel Hoffman and a list of items he owned prior to his marriage to Ellin Moale Curson, 1828-34, are in the oversize section. Remaining business documents include Arnaud Rambie's power of attorney to Samuel Poultney, 1 June 1827; rental agreements and bills, 1842-54; a stock certificate for the Canton Company of Baltimore, 1829; and a certificate of deposit for Poultney, Ellicott and Company. The correspondence contains a letter from R.W. Gill to Poultney, Ellicott and Company (4 October 1834), a letter from Samuel Hoffman to Samuel Poultney (3 January 1835), and drafts of letters to John B. Stunberger and R.W. Gill, all concerning the banking scandal, as well as an undated letter from Philip Poultney to James W. Williams in Annapolis, Maryland. Included also in this series, are the Alexandria Boarding School tuition bill for Thomas Poultney and a grade report for Richard Poultney, 1850. Papers relating to the Curson family, 1773-1830, comprise Series VI. These documents cover their businesses, personal correspondence, receipts, and the inheritance of the Curson estates in England by Elizabeth Rebecca Becker Curson and her younger sister, Ellin Moale Curson. The Cursons began their mercantile career in America when Richard Curson, Sr., established the Curson and Seton Company of New York and St. Eustatius (an island in the Dutch West Indies) with either his son-in-law, William Seton, or William's uncle, Andrew Seton. His eldest son, Samuel, was also a member of this firm which flourished from ca. 1773-76. Documents relating to this concern span the aforementioned years and include an account and a bill of exchange. Fleeing the British because of his revolutionary sentiment, Richard left New York on 20 June 1776 and later removed to Baltimore, Maryland, where he set up Richard Curson and Company, 1777-1803, at 51 Water Street. By 1785, he had been joined by his second son, Richard, Jr. As an importer of goods and wines from Italy and Spain, Richard, Sr., used his ships as privateers to run the British blockade and attack their vessels during the American Revolution. Between 1779 and 1781, eight of Richard Curson and Company's ships were issued letters of marque and reprisal by the Continental Congress. Correspondence relating to this company discusses the slave trade (17 September 1791), business in St. Eustatius, and trade in wine and silks. Papers for this firm cover the years, 1777-92. Samuel Curson, like his father, wished to avoid the British in New York and therefore by March, 1776, had taken up residence on St. Eustatius. By 1777, he had established the Curson and Gouveneur Company with Isaac Gouveneur, Jr., which operated out of St. Eustatius and New York. The two men dissolved the company on 31 May 1785 either because of their mutual bad health or because of a difference between them. Miscellaneous accounts for Samuel Curson cover the years 1774-86 and contain of bill of exchange with Effingham Lawrence. Some bills of exchange, promissory notes, and accounts, 1779-85, from the Curson and Gouveneur Company survive, but the business correspondence, 1785-86, contains the majority of the information about this firm and its successor, Samuel Curson Company of New York. Founded in July, 1785, Samuel Curson Company established Curson in his own firm while allowing him to also pay off the debts still owed by the Curson and Gouveneur Company. The letters are representative of other mercantile correspondence of the time and discuss the flour and Indian corn trade between American and English companies; prices of corn, wheat, Indian corn, wines, flour, slaves, gunpowder, tobacco, rice, and fish; the umbrella trade; ships used to transport goods; and Samuel's trade in fine china. A 10 May 1785 letter mentions the problem of selling slaves for cash on the island of Fayal (in the Azores) when the island already has too many slaves. Furthermore, the correspondence from September, 1785, through April, 1786, contains references to the problems between Spain and Algeria and the specter of Algerian privateers and Moorish cruisers. Other references to business and personal matters occur in a block of correspondence written to Samuel Curson by his father, Richard, Sr., between 1785-1786. The elder Curson discusses prices of commodities; the illness of Isaac Gouveneur, Jr.; various ships and captains; the 1785 maiden voyage of the Calcutta-built ship, Pallas India Man; collection of monies owed to him; the August, 1785, construction by Thomas Peters of a brewery in Baltimore; the new tobacco inspection law; a letter of introduction to Samuel concerning Light-Horse Harry Lee; and Samuel's application to the U.S. Congress for the position of U.S. Consul in London. In a letter dated 20 August 1785, Richard refers to Thomas Jefferson as a warm Friend of mine and mentions Gen. Horatio Gates as a person from whom he will obtain a letter of introduction for Samuel in his bid for consul. These letters also provide veiled glimpses into the issue which ultimately led to Samuel's death. Apparently, Curson was accused of fathering the illegitimate son of Betsey [Burling] who later married Richard John Whittell of England, a first cousin of Samuel. Her brother, [Walter] Burling of Baltimore, Maryland, sought satisfaction from Samuel in the form of money and therefore pursued Curson from the West Indies to London and finally to America. In New York on 21 April 1786, Burling challenged Curson to a duel in which Samuel received a wound to the groin. Three days later Curson succumbed and was interred at the Trinity Church in New York. The complete truth of the matter is unknown, but some family members conjecture that Samuel actually duelled with Whittell (a.k.a. Walter Burling). Eight letters mention the illegitimate child issue (22 July 1785, 1 August 1785, 6 September 1785, 27 September 1785, 25 October 1785, 7 December 1785, 2 March 1786, and 26 April 1786) with the 25 October letter and John Curson's 7 December correspondence giving the most information. The letters also hint that Richard Whittell may have tried to blackmail the Cursons. Other letters include three written by Thomas Whittell, father of Richard. For further information on this affair, read J. Hall Pleasants's The Curzon Family of New York and Baltimore. The remaining Curson company accounts and papers constitute a 1785 power of attorney from Richard Curson to Samuel Curson; a 1791 power of attorney from Richard Curson, Sr., to Richard Curson, Jr.; and the correspondence of Richard Curson, Jr., 1786-96. Topics discussed in the letters included business with his father and R.H. Moale, and the 1791 hurricane in New Bern, North Carolina. Curson family receipted bills span the years, 1797-1822, and are mostly for clothing and accessories. Family members represented in the receipts include Elizabeth (Moale) Curson, Richard Curson, Jr., Ellin (North) Moale, Elizabeth R.B. Curson, and Ellin Moale Curson. Ellin (North) Moale (1740-1825) was the first white child born in Baltimore, Maryland. The final group of Curson papers concerns the inheritance of English estates by Elizabeth R.B. and Ellin Moale Curson, ca. 1822. Spanning the years 1783-1830, the estate documents include abstracts from the wills of Richard Curson of Richmond and John Curson of Ipswich and surveys of the freehold estates of Richard Curson, Sr., ca. 1783-1799; papers and correspondence, 1793-1825, n.d; and oversize accounts with a copy of the Lawrence mortgage, 1809-30. In the early correspondence, 1793-1815, topics discussed included the death of John Curson of Ipswich; the contents of his will; the property left to Mrs. Wood by Richard Curson of Richmond (inherited later by the Curson women); the incapability of Richard Curson, Jr., and the necessity of having him declared a lunatic, 1806-08; building of the Vauxhall Bridge across the Thames River on the Curson property, 1809, 1815; and the suspension of trade and the probability of war between England and America, 1807-08. The correspondence resumes in 1820 with Edward B. Lawrence's letter to Elizabeth (Moale) Curson telling her that an agent must be appointed to finally settle the Curson estates now that Elizabeth R.B. and Ellin are of age. She asked Richard Carroll to become their agent who in turn contacted Thomas Walford of Foulkes, Langford, and Walford in London. Carroll's goal was to settle the estate, pay the Lawrence mortgage, and sell the other properties. Letters between Carroll and Walford, 1820-22, reveal their problem with the law firm of Holmes and Turner who would not give up the Curson estate documents in their possession. Walford finally obtained the papers in late 1821 or early 1822. In his letters, Walford also wrote about the disposal of the Lawrence mortgage, the other properties to be sold, and money earned from the Vauxhall Bridge Company and the sale of the Curson lots in and around London (4 June 1822). The women received about [UNK]20,000 after paying the mortgage and the surveyor. Series VII contains the George-Ellicott-Tyson correspondence, 1823-73. The George-Ellicott letters discussed family news and were written by Eliza George (later Mrs. John D. Early) to her maternal aunts, Leatitia H. Ellicott (later Mrs. Thomas R. Fisher) and Mary Ann Ellicott, 1823-29, 1839; Mary Ann Ellicott to her sister, Mrs. L.E. Fisher, 1837; and Anne George to her aunt, Mrs. Thomas Fisher, 1841. Other items include a wedding invitation to Mrs. Eliza Early, 1873; a letter from Isabella Belle Tyson to Harvey, Fanny, and Polly, 1872; and a name card of Mrs. Ross Winans, n.d. One letter written by Eliza George is in the oversize file. Dr. Stedman R. Tilghman's scrapbook, 1838-45, containing newspaper clippings on mountain and prairie life, autographs, correspondence, a piece of beaver tail, engravings, and twenty-five pencil, pen, and watercolor sketches, nineteen of which were done by Richard Caton Woodville (1825-55), comprises Series VIII. The Woodville sketches consist of professors and fellow students at the University of Maryland, 1842-43, doctors and persons at the Baltimore Alms House, 1845, and a sketch of Woodville himself. The young Baltimore artist originally began a medical career and studied at the University of Maryland during the 1842-43 session. During that time, he would have met his old friend from St. Mary's College, Stedman R. Tilghman (1822-48), who graduated from the medical school in 1843. Tilghman left that year to accompany Sir William Drummond Stewart on his last expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Sketches from that expedition are in the scrapbook. This volume is restricted. The A[ndrew] J.H. Way scrapbook, 1864-88, is the last series of the Pleasants Papers. Way (1826-88) was a Baltimore artist noted for painting fruit. His scrapbook contains newspaper clippings on art sales, exhibits, artists, and the Maryland Academy of Art as well as death notices for various persons.    Important Access InformationACCESS: this file includes a great deal of highly confidential information (primarily as to private ownership of extremely valuable works of art); therefor it is a closed file. USERS MUST APPLY IN ADVANCE IN WRITING STATING WHAT INFORMATION THEY ARE SEEKING AND THE PURPOSE OF THEIR RESEARCH. Essentially, the file is available to art scholars only--it is most definitely not available to dealers, auction houses, appraisers, or anyone engaged in commercial transactions involving art. As time permits, Gallery Staff members are willing to research the Pleasants file on behalf of individuals if they will provide the staff with a snapshot or photo (even a decent xerox will do) of the picture they are researching and the questions they wish answered.     August 8, 1990 TO: ALL LIBRARY STAFF (Penny Ann Francis Joe and all volunteers) FROM: Jennifer Goldsborough RE: J. Hall Pleasants' file To avoid confusion here is some information about this file: WHAT: file on paintings existing in Maryland during the 1920s and '30s as researched by Dr. Pleasants--includes photographs and relevant information on subjects and artists for portraits, landscapes, etc. found by Dr. Pleasants in Maryland homes, courthouses, churches, public and private institutions --whatever he could see! USE: useful in determining who might have painted a given subject or what subjects may have been painted by a particular artist--indexed by subject's name and by artist (since about 4,000 paintings are included, it is of little or no use unless either the subject or artist is known--i.e. virtually impossible to trace a completely unknown painting just by the visual image) 1.

Exec's departure comes after Disney scored with 'Disney Infinity' game




In a surprise move, John Pleasants has stepped down as co-president of Disney Interactive.
Move comes as the Walt Disney Co. said Monday it will merge all game and online operations under Jimmy Pitaro, who already is based in Los Angeles. Pleasants, the company’s games guru, recently launched “Disney Infinity,” and is based in San Francisco.
“Following three years of consistent operating improvement at Disney Interactive and a great partnership between John and Jimmy, we are now in a position to fulfill our original objective to consolidate our Interactive business under one Los Angeles-based leader,” said Robert A. Iger, chairman and CEO, the Walt Disney Co.







“With Jimmy and John’s input, we have created an Interactive organization that is best structured to meet the demands of the fast-moving technology industry,” Iger added. “I thank John for his many contributions to Disney Interactive including building tentpole products like ‘Disney Infinity’ and establishing the company as a leading mobile games publisher and appreciate his passion for bringing Disney experiences to guests on new platforms.”
Re-org is meant to enable Disney to take better advantage of merging web and mobile entertainment platforms, the company said, and embrace a single strategy to generate revenue from its franchises.
Having two presidents simply proved too complicated for Disney Interactive, especially with leaders who wanted more resources for areas they were interested in building at the company.
Pleasants and Pitaro had been co-presidents of the group since October 2010. Pleasants landed the position after Disney acquired his social gaming company Playdom for $563 million in July 2010.
Playdom, however, hasn’t proved as lucrative of a purchase as Disney had hoped, with mobile games proving a more successful area for Disney.
Under Pleasants, Disney did recently score with the launch of new game “Disney Infinity,” which competes with Activision’s hit “Skylanders” franchise. It also oversees popular kids destination Club Penguin, and is behind mobile hits “Where’s My Water?” and the more recent spin-off “Where’s My Mickey?”

In a statement, Pitaro said Pleasants “has been critical in helping Disney Interactive build a great foundation off of which we will continue to deliver quality interactive games, mobile and web experiences that entertain and engage our guests.”
“I am extremely proud of the work our teams have done to create leading interactive games and experiences for our guests,” Pleasants said in a statement. The former chief operating officer at Electronic Arts and CEO of Ticketmaster added, “through quality and innovation, the business is generating tangible results and momentum, and I am confident that consolidating our collective efforts at this time will lead to even greater acceleration.”
Disney Interactive showed a positive sign of growth during Disney’s fourth quarter, which wrapped Sept 28, when it reported sales of $396 million and profits of $16 million, a positive sign for a division that has long struggled to turn a profit.







The group was losing $300 million a year when Pleasants and Pitaro took over in 2010. In fiscal 2013, it reduced that to a loss of $78 million

 	Wait, Samsung has an app store?John Pleasants, head of Samsung's US media solutions unit, plans to breathe new life into the company.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                 	You could be forgiven if you've never heard of Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own version of an app store, designed to service its increasingly large lineup of products, which grew on Wednesday with the unveiling of the  Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge. Prior to July,  Galaxy Apps went by Samsung Apps, the change being an acknowledgement that awareness of the store was limited. 	John Pleasants, head of Samsung's Media Solutions Center America, or MSCA, the unit responsible for the app store, wants to change that. 	"Our app store needs to be world class in itself," he said in an interview. "We need to work more at attracting more developers."

  	The unit has seen some drastic changes over the last several months. Pleasants, who joined Samsung in June after stints at companies such as Disney and Electronic Arts, runs a unit that traditionally has reported back to headquarters in Korea. In August, the unit was shuffled under Samsung's US unit, and Pleasants reports to Samsung's North American CEO, Gregory Lee.

 "It's a big deal, actually," Pleasants said. "It's a very empowering sort of thing for us." 	By aligning itself more closely to the other regional units, Pleasants said, his unit contributes more to the immediate success of Samsung's products. Previously, MSCA acted like a satellite operation more focused on research. "Before, it was people on the side reporting up to headquarters that were working on things not necessarily at the spear point of commercialization (in North America)," he said. 	One of the focuses for Pleasants will be improving Galaxy Apps. He doesn't intend for Samsung's app store to replace Google Play, which boasts more than 1 million apps and wide adoption. Instead, Galaxy Apps will be more selective, and focus on apps that take advantage of Samsung's unique products or features, such as the S Pen stylus on the Galaxy Note line of big-screen smartphones. 	It's also important that the apps and media run seamlessly on every device. At the Samsung-hosted event in New York, Pleasants said the company's streaming-music service,  Milk, will run not just on smartphones, but Web TVs and wearable products as well. He also stressed that he doesn't just see Galaxy Apps as an app store, but a potential new platform.Pleasants had Adam Levine and James Valentine from Maroon 5 show up to talk about Milk.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                 	"We're going to focus on making our ecosystem hum and sing better than anyone else's," he said. 	Pleasants acknowledged that Galaxy Apps hasn't been successful yet. The app store isn't easy to work with, and there are improvements needed in software development kits, application programming interfaces and general developer support. 	The slew of Samsung apps that came preloaded on flagship devices such as the Galaxy S3 came from MSCA as well. Those apps have been the target of critics, some of whom have labeled them no better than bloatware, or useless bits of preloaded software that do little more than take up space. 	MSCA will still make apps, Pleasants said, but it will pare down the number to a few that "are meaningful and move the dial." He admitted that some of the company's apps haven't had much success, and that Samsung would move away from them. 	He wouldn't comment on how MSCA operated in the past, noting only that things have changed radically in the last three years.

  	"We intend on upping our game," he said. "It's gotten significantly better and it will continue to get better." Update, 12:21 p.m. PT: Clarifies quote from John Pleasants, head of Samsung's Media Solutions Center America, or MSCA.

Biographical/Historical Information
                              
The Pleasants family were a prominent Virginia Quaker family with lands on the Upper James River. John Pleasants (d. 1698)
                           emigrated from England and settled in Henrico County, Virginia, around 1665. He
                           converted to Quakerism and was an active and prominent member of the church, donating land to the church, the Curles Meeting
                           House, and filing peitions and reports to the authorities on behalf of the Society of
                           Friends. He married Jane (Larcome) Tucker, widow of Samuel Tucker, in 1670.
                           
                        
John Pleasants, II (1671-1714), was the son of John and Jane Pleasants. He married Dorothy Cary, daughter of Thomas and Ann
                           (Milner) Cary, in 1694.
                           
                        
His second son, John Pleasants III (1697-1771), also a Quaker, amassed a fortune in land and slaves, but in later life he
                           advocated the abolition of slavery. In his last will, 11 August 1771, he requested that
                           his slaves be emancipated. He married three times, first to Margaret Jordan (b. 1699), daughter of Robert Jordan and his first
                           wife Mary (Belson) Jordan. In 1750 he married Mary Woodson, daughter of Tarleton and
                           Judith (Fleming) Woodson. Finally he married Miriam Hunnicutt, widow of Glaister Hunnicutt.
                           
                        
Robert Pleasants (1723-1810), second son of John and Margaret Pleasants, was born at "Curles" Plantation, Henrico County,
                           Virginia. He was a staunch Quaker, zealous agitator against slavery, and the first
                           president of the Abolition Society of Virginia, established in 1790. In 1782 he successfully lobbied for the Manumission Act
                           and in 1792 sent a petition to the U.S. Congress from the Virginia Abolition Society
                           calling for the end to the slave trade. He went to court repeatedly to free hundreds of slaves. In 1784 Robert founded the
                           Gravelly Hill School, the first school for free blacks in Virginia, and set aside 350
                           acres of land to maintain the schools.
                           
                        
Samuel Pleasants (1737-1807), also a son of John and Margaret Pleasants, was born at "Curles" Plantation. At the age of twenty
                           five, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and established himself as a
                           merchant. He married Mary Pemberton (1738-1821) in 1762. He was also active in the abolitionist movement. In 1777, Samuel
                           Pleasants, along with several of his brothers-in-law and other prominent Quakers, were
                           arrested and imprisoned as "Torries" because they refused to bear arms. General George Washington intervened and personally
                           signed an order for their release.
                           
                        
James Pleasants (1769-1836), served as Governor of Virginia, 1822-1825. His son, John Hampden Pleasants (1797-1846), founded
                           the Richmond Whig newspaper. He married Ann Elizabeth Irvin and Mary Massie. He was
                           killed on 27 February 1846 in a duel with Thomas Ritchie, Jr., owner of rival newspaper the Richmond Enquirer.
