History[edit]
1994–2000: Foundation and early success[edit]
Golub Capital was founded in New York City in 1994 by Lawrence Golub. Golub had previously worked at Allen & Company, Wasserstein Perella & Co., and Bankers Trust. He had also been a White House Fellow.[12] The firm initially operated with $20 million of equity capital under management.[13][12] Anchor investors in Golub Capital's first fund included Dan Lufkin (of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette), Stanley S. Shuman (of Allen & Company), and Mellon Bank among others.[14] Golub and an assistant were the only employees at Golub Capital's outset, but, by 2000, the firm had between 8 and 10 employees and a fund worth a couple hundred million dollars.[13][15]
2000–2004: Shift in focus[edit]
In 2000, the firm began specializing in mezzanine loans. These loans were geared toward private equity-backed companies. Golub Capital no longer made investments in controlled private equity investments in order not to compete with their private equity clients. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust in 2000, the firm achieved success with its mezzanine loans as most cash flow loans became unavailable.[13][12]
In 2003, David Golub (Lawrence's brother)[12] joined the firm as its President (with Lawrence Golub remaining CEO). Golub had previously been Managing Director of both Centre Partners Management LLC and Corporate Partners.[16] Also in 2004, Andrew Steuerman (previously of Albion Alliance and the New York Life Insurance Company) joined Golub Capital. Steuerman became the head of originations[12] and eventually gained the titles of Senior Managing Director and Head of Middle Market and Late Stage Lending.[2]
2004–2008: Further business expansion[edit]
In 2004, Golub Capital began offering senior and one-stop loans. By 2007, the firm was a lead lender and arranger in senior loans.[13] In 2005, on the final closing of its fourth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners IV), the firm raised $800 million of equity capital. Its fifth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners V) raised $700 million of equity capital. Golub Capital's total capital under management increased to $2.5 billion as a result.[17][18]
2008–present: Financial crisis and beyond[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, Golub Capital was one of the few lending firms that continued to grow.[13][12] By the end of 2008, the firm was third by deal volume for lead arrangers of sub-$100 million leveraged buyout loans and had raised $1.5 billion for new loans.[10][12] In 2009, it became the number one bookrunner for leveraged buyout loans in the middle market. By 2010, the firm had $4 billion capital under management.[9]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010. It trades on the NASDAQ under stock ticker symbol, GBDC.[15][8] David Golub serves as the CEO and President of Golub Capital BDC.[16]
In 2011, the firm had 120 employees with offices in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.[12] Their loan portfolio also increased to $5 billion.[19] In 2012, the firm led a targeted campaign to serve lower middle market companies that have an annual EBITDA of between $6 and $8 million.[20]
In 2014, the firm's capital under management increased to $10 billion with the final closings of the Golub Capital Partners VIII fund and the Golub Capital Partners International VIII.[14] That year, the firm closed a mix of deals, including boot retailer Boot Barn with a $100 million facility[21] and fiber optic infrastructure company Wilcon Holdings with a $59 million facility.[22] The firm opened a lending office in San Francisco in 2014 to handle its late stage lending business line.[6] As of 2016, the firm has over $20 billion in capital under management.[1][3]
Businesses[edit]
Golub Capital has three main business lines: middle market lending, late stage lending, and broadly syndicated loans.[4] The firm typically invests in sectors like SaaS, health care, restaurants, business services, and many others.[19][2] The firm is also affiliated with Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly traded (NASDAQ: GDBC) business development company.[15]
Middle Market Lending[edit]
Andrew Steuerman heads Golub Capital’s Middle Market Lending team located in Chicago and New York. The business line focuses on providing senior, one-stop, and second lien debt to U.S. middle market companies, typically controlled by private equity firms.[14][12] Golub Capital can hold over $400 million in each middle market lending deal,[23] and the team can also underwrite and syndicate senior credit facilities and a proprietary suite of one-loan debt facilities of up to $750 million.[24] The typical borrower generates between $5 million to $50 million a year in EBITDA and is backed by one of over 200 private equity companies with which Golub Capital has a working relationship.[20] Approximately 85% of financings done with private equity companies come from pre-existing relationships.[14]
Late Stage Lending[edit]
The firm's late stage lending unit is also headed by Andrew Steuerman.[2] The team operates out of the firm's San Francisco office in order to be closer to Silicon Valley.[4] The business offers debt to fast-growing technology companies backed by venture capital, growth equity, private equity, or other private companies.[4][6]
Broadly Syndicated Loans[edit]
Golub Capital's Broadly Syndicated Loans group is headed by Christina Jamieson in the firm's Chicago office.[9][14] This unit focuses on investing in larger loans that are generally liquid in the secondary market. The Broadly Syndicated Loans team also manages a series of collateralized loan obligations.[25]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc.[edit]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc., (a business development company) was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010 NASDAQ: GBDC.[15] David Golub serves as the President and CEO of the company.[16] The company lends money to middle market companies that have backing from private equity firms.[26]
Recognition and awards[edit]
Golub Capital has received substantial industry recognition since 2009. In 2016, it was awarded "Lender of the Year, Americas," "Senior Lender of the Year, Americas," and "Business Development Company of the Year" by Private Debt Investor.[27] In 2015, Private Debt Investor named Golub Capital "Lender of the Year" and "Unitranche Lender of the Year."[11] Also in 2015, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was named "Best Business Development Company" by Creditflux.[28][29] In 2014, the firm was recognized by Private Debt Investor as the 10th largest private debt fund manager.[30] In 2012, Golub Capital was named the "Lender Firm of the Year" by both M&A Advisor and ACG New York.[31] Buyouts Magazine named Golub Capital the "Middle Market Lender of the Year" in 2009 and 2010.[9][13] Golub Capital has received numerous awards from Mergers & Acquisitions including "2008 Lender of the Year,"[32] "Debt Financing Agent of the Year" in 2010,[13] and Lender of the Year in 2017.[23]

History[edit]
1994–2000: Foundation and early success[edit]
Golub Capital was founded in New York City in 1994 by Lawrence Golub. Golub had previously worked at Allen & Company, Wasserstein Perella & Co., and Bankers Trust. He had also been a White House Fellow.[12] The firm initially operated with $20 million of equity capital under management.[13][12] Anchor investors in Golub Capital's first fund included Dan Lufkin (of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette), Stanley S. Shuman (of Allen & Company), and Mellon Bank among others.[14] Golub and an assistant were the only employees at Golub Capital's outset, but, by 2000, the firm had between 8 and 10 employees and a fund worth a couple hundred million dollars.[13][15]
2000–2004: Shift in focus[edit]
In 2000, the firm began specializing in mezzanine loans. These loans were geared toward private equity-backed companies. Golub Capital no longer made investments in controlled private equity investments in order not to compete with their private equity clients. In the aftermath of the dot-com bust in 2000, the firm achieved success with its mezzanine loans as most cash flow loans became unavailable.[13][12]
In 2003, David Golub (Lawrence's brother)[12] joined the firm as its President (with Lawrence Golub remaining CEO). Golub had previously been Managing Director of both Centre Partners Management LLC and Corporate Partners.[16] Also in 2004, Andrew Steuerman (previously of Albion Alliance and the New York Life Insurance Company) joined Golub Capital. Steuerman became the head of originations[12] and eventually gained the titles of Senior Managing Director and Head of Middle Market and Late Stage Lending.[2]
2004–2008: Further business expansion[edit]
In 2004, Golub Capital began offering senior and one-stop loans. By 2007, the firm was a lead lender and arranger in senior loans.[13] In 2005, on the final closing of its fourth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners IV), the firm raised $800 million of equity capital. Its fifth GCP fund (Golub Capital Partners V) raised $700 million of equity capital. Golub Capital's total capital under management increased to $2.5 billion as a result.[17][18]
2008–present: Financial crisis and beyond[edit]
During the 2008 financial crisis, Golub Capital was one of the few lending firms that continued to grow.[13][12] By the end of 2008, the firm was third by deal volume for lead arrangers of sub-$100 million leveraged buyout loans and had raised $1.5 billion for new loans.[10][12] In 2009, it became the number one bookrunner for leveraged buyout loans in the middle market. By 2010, the firm had $4 billion capital under management.[9]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010. It trades on the NASDAQ under stock ticker symbol, GBDC.[15][8] David Golub serves as the CEO and President of Golub Capital BDC.[16]
In 2011, the firm had 120 employees with offices in New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.[12] Their loan portfolio also increased to $5 billion.[19] In 2012, the firm led a targeted campaign to serve lower middle market companies that have an annual EBITDA of between $6 and $8 million.[20]
In 2014, the firm's capital under management increased to $10 billion with the final closings of the Golub Capital Partners VIII fund and the Golub Capital Partners International VIII.[14] That year, the firm closed a mix of deals, including boot retailer Boot Barn with a $100 million facility[21] and fiber optic infrastructure company Wilcon Holdings with a $59 million facility.[22] The firm opened a lending office in San Francisco in 2014 to handle its late stage lending business line.[6] As of 2016, the firm has over $20 billion in capital under management.[1][3]
Businesses[edit]
Golub Capital has three main business lines: middle market lending, late stage lending, and broadly syndicated loans.[4] The firm typically invests in sectors like SaaS, health care, restaurants, business services, and many others.[19][2] The firm is also affiliated with Golub Capital BDC, Inc., a publicly traded (NASDAQ: GDBC) business development company.[15]
Middle Market Lending[edit]
Andrew Steuerman heads Golub Capital’s Middle Market Lending team located in Chicago and New York. The business line focuses on providing senior, one-stop, and second lien debt to U.S. middle market companies, typically controlled by private equity firms.[14][12] Golub Capital can hold over $400 million in each middle market lending deal,[23] and the team can also underwrite and syndicate senior credit facilities and a proprietary suite of one-loan debt facilities of up to $750 million.[24] The typical borrower generates between $5 million to $50 million a year in EBITDA and is backed by one of over 200 private equity companies with which Golub Capital has a working relationship.[20] Approximately 85% of financings done with private equity companies come from pre-existing relationships.[14]
Late Stage Lending[edit]
The firm's late stage lending unit is also headed by Andrew Steuerman.[2] The team operates out of the firm's San Francisco office in order to be closer to Silicon Valley.[4] The business offers debt to fast-growing technology companies backed by venture capital, growth equity, private equity, or other private companies.[4][6]
Broadly Syndicated Loans[edit]
Golub Capital's Broadly Syndicated Loans group is headed by Christina Jamieson in the firm's Chicago office.[9][14] This unit focuses on investing in larger loans that are generally liquid in the secondary market. The Broadly Syndicated Loans team also manages a series of collateralized loan obligations.[25]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc.[edit]
Golub Capital BDC, Inc., (a business development company) was founded in 2009 and went public in March 2010 NASDAQ: GBDC.[15] David Golub serves as the President and CEO of the company.[16] The company lends money to middle market companies that have backing from private equity firms.[26]
Recognition and awards[edit]
Golub Capital has received substantial industry recognition since 2009. In 2016, it was awarded "Lender of the Year, Americas," "Senior Lender of the Year, Americas," and "Business Development Company of the Year" by Private Debt Investor.[27] In 2015, Private Debt Investor named Golub Capital "Lender of the Year" and "Unitranche Lender of the Year."[11] Also in 2015, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. was named "Best Business Development Company" by Creditflux.[28][29] In 2014, the firm was recognized by Private Debt Investor as the 10th largest private debt fund manager.[30] In 2012, Golub Capital was named the "Lender Firm of the Year" by both M&A Advisor and ACG New York.[31] Buyouts Magazine named Golub Capital the "Middle Market Lender of the Year" in 2009 and 2010.[9][13] Golub Capital has received numerous awards from Mergers & Acquisitions including "2008 Lender of the Year,"[32] "Debt Financing Agent of the Year" in 2010,[13] and Lender of the Year in 2017.[23]

Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 28, 2017, Golub Capital BDC Funding LLC ("Funding"), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into an amendment
(the "Credit Facility Amendment") to the documents governing Funding's senior
secured revolving credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Facility") with the
Company, as the transferor and servicer, certain institutional
lenders, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the swingline lender, collateral agent,
account bank, collateral custodian, and administrative agent. The Credit
Facility Amendment was effective as of July 28, 2017.
The Credit Facility Amendment, among other things, (a) extended the expiration
of the revolving period from July 29, 2017 to September 27, 2017, during which
period Funding, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the
facility and (b) extended the stated maturity date from July 30, 2020 to
September 28, 2020.
As previously disclosed, the Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets
held by Funding, and the Company has pledged its interests in Funding as
collateral to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as the collateral agent, to secure the
obligations of the Company as the transferor and servicer under the Credit
Facility. Borrowing under the Credit Facility remains subject to the leverage
restrictions contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
The description above is only a summary of the material provisions of the Credit
Facility Amendment and is qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of
the Credit Facility Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this current
report on Form 8-K.
Item 9.01.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d)  Exhibits.
10.1  Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Servicing Agreement,
dated as of July 28, 2017, by and among Golub Capital BDC Funding LLC, as the
borrower; Golub Capital BDC, Inc., as the transferor and servicer; the
institutional lenders identified on the signature pages thereto; Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., as the swingline lender, collateral agent, account bank, collateral
custodian, and administrative agent.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

				Golub Capital BDC, Inc. - Initiation Note



Golub Capital BDC, Inc.
NEUTRAL (GBDC, $17.55)
Strong Origination Platform, Good Asset Quality with Very Low Non- Accruals, Consistently Increasing NAV/share, But Valuation is Fair and NII/share is Likely to Remain Flat - Initiating With A NEUTRAL Rating And $18 Price Target.

Investment Conclusion. We are initiating coverage of Golub Capital BDC Inc. (GBDC) with a NEUTRAL rating and $18 price target. GBDC is the public vehicle of the Golub family of funds which combined have total AUM (assets under management) of over $18 billion as of 6/30/16; making them one of the largest BDCs (public & private). Additionally, the total platform is almost entirely in leveraged loans and the ability to invest across funds provides GBDC with a significant advantage during a time when certainty of closing matters more to borrowers than pricing. This also permits the company to have relatively small hold sizes within the portfolio while still closing on larger deals in the platform; mitigating the risk of concentration within GBDC. This is demonstrated by the fact that GBDC finished 6/30/16 with a portfolio at fair value of $1.63 billion across 185 companies but the average investment size was a mere $8.2 million. Since the quarter ended 12/31/12 non-accruals as a percentage of par have averaged 0.7%. This strong asset quality at Golub has led to consistent NAV/share increases, generating strong economic returns (changes in NAV/share plus dividends divided by beginning of period NAV/share) for shareholders. We expect GBDC’s NII/share to be largely flat although we expect further step-ups in NAV/share and continued sound asset quality. Despite Golub being a best-in-class originator, we believe the stock is fairly valued and we are therefore giving the company a NEUTRAL rating and $18 price target. Our $18 price target implies an estimated 2017 P/NII (Price/NII) of 14.1x, dividend yield of 7.1%, and P/NAV (Price/NAV) of 1.10x compared to the BDC sector averages of 8.8x, 10.5%, and 0.86x, respectively.

* Core NII = NII + capital gains incentive fee (reversal)
