Evan M. Goldberg, Esq.  




Evan M. Goldberg, Esq. 







Evan M. Goldberg, Esq. is a partner and senior trial attorney with the New York City law
firm of Trolman, Glaser &amp; Lichtman and Past President of the New York State Trial Lawyers
Association.
As a third-generation lawyer, he has continued his family’s tradition of service during his
exclusive representation of negligence victims over the past 28 years in matters involving
automobile, construction and premises accidents, medical malpractice, product liability and
wrongful death proceedings. His verdicts and performance in court have achieved recognition
in the media, in “Top Verdicts in New York” listings, as well as by his inclusion in the “Super
Lawyers” list for the New York region.
Mr. Goldberg has also been active in the New York State Bar Association, first chairing a
Medical Malpractice Committee within the Association, then serving as the elected Chair of the
Trial Lawyers Section and ultimately being elected to the Association’s Executive Committee
and House of Delegates, helping to govern the 75,000 attorney-member organization.  As part
of his work with the State Bar, as well as his presidency of the State Trial Lawyers,
he has chaired programs and committees, lectured to attorneys and the public, authored book
chapters and articles and has given his expert legal commentary on network television and
radio, all involving different aspects of personal injury law.  As a Bar Leader, he lobbies the State
Legislature, the Governor’s office and the United States Congress to help secure the continued
rights of accident victims.
Mr. Goldberg devotes considerable time to charitable endeavors, being a Fellow of the New
York Bar Foundation and serving the legal needs of the Children’s Arts &amp; Science Workshops, a
non-profit organization dedicated to providing choices and development for at-risk youth in
New York City.  He has participated in worker-safety panel discussions for SOMOS for years and
is SOMOS’ newest board member.

Whoopi Goldberg Gets Into the Marijuana Business

Whoopi Goldberg, the actress and co-host of daytime talk show The View, is launching a new company to sell a centuries-old remedy for women's menstrual pain:  marijuana.
Based in San Francisco, Whoopi & Maya is positioned as a by-women, for-women pot edibles business. Goldberg is teaming with  cannabis grower and edibles maker Maya Elisabeth, herbalist Alexis Gandara, and pot industry PR company founder Evan Nison on the venture, which will begin selling products in marijuana dispensaries in its home city in April.
"I see cannabis as a step in the direction of new forms of medicine, but it also has its place in history and goes back to Queen Victoria," Goldberg tells Inc. "There are many people trying to get you high. We're just trying to get you comfortable."

The company's products, which are all infused with THC and medicinal herbs such as elderberry, red raspberry leaf, and Guelder-rose, include raw sipping cacao for hot chocolate, a bath salt soak, a body balm for use as a local anesthetic, and a tincture to add to liquids or drop under the tongue. All of the products were developed specifically to relieve menstrual discomfort.

Only a handful of dispensaries will sell Whoopi & Maya products at launch but the founders expect to expand to other stores and new regions over the course of the next year. It will sell non-psychoactive versions of its products made with CBD, a chemical in cannabis that helps reduce inflammation and acts as an anti-convulsant, in states without a legal marijuana market.
Goldberg says she was speaking to her daughter when she came up with the idea for a woman-focused edibles company last year. "We were trying to figure out a product [for menstrual pain] that wasn't full of ingredients with names we couldn't pronounce, and then it hit me." She says she had been using a vape pen with THC oil for her glaucoma, but the more research she did the more she read about THC topical rubs and tinctures.
The founders raised $650,000 from friends and family over the last year to launch the company. All of the pot comes from an all-female-run medical marijuana farm in northern California, which Elisabeth has been involved with since 2008. Goldberg says the company is open to expanding its market beyond solely women, especially as pot sales become legal in more states and the U.S. dispels what she calls "the lie of marijuana being a Schedule I drug" that's as harmful as harder substances such as heroin.
Eventually, Whoopi & Maya also could look to broaden its product lines to other medicinal applications. "Marijuana is like penicillin, Goldberg says. "The amount of things cannabis seems to help is like the amount of things penicillin seems to help."

As CTO and co-founder of NetSuite, Evan Goldberg is driving the product direction for the software as a service (SaaS) company. Goldberg tells MyCustomer.com about the company history, Larry Ellison, SaaS wars - and why he hopes that SAP's Business ByDesign is a good product.

By Stuart Lauchlan, news and analysis editor
It takes two. The most successful high-tech firms are often the ones where there are two people at the top, albeit only one of whom becomes the 'public face'. Think of Bill Gates and Paul Allen at Microsoft, Larry Ellison and Bob Miner at Oracle, or the Steves - Jobs and Wozniak - over at Apple. At NetSuite, CEO Zach Nelson has become the front man for the software as a service (SaaS) vendor, but behind the scenes Evan Goldberg is driving the product direction for the company as its chief technology officer. 
"I hope to some degree that SAP's Business ByDesign is a good product so that people can see SaaS is viable as a model."



Evan Goldberg, CTO, NetSuiteGoldberg is also one of the co-founders of the firm, which was set up with financial backing from Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, former boss of both Goldberg and Nelson. NetSuite was not Goldberg's first stop after quitting the database firm. “I was doing my own start-up dev eloping interactive media technology for websites, something similar to what Macromedia took over, although they didn't exist when we started,” he says. “After they came along, I was thinking about what I wanted to do next. 
“The impetus for what was then called NetLedger came through the experience of running my own small company of about 15 people after having been at Oracle. We had about 15 different systems to run the business, one for every three people we employed. We had QuickBook, Yahoo Stores, customer support done through email, an Access database that we used for sales and customer management, and a few other products. To get a list of our customers we could go to five different places and it was never a definitive list of what customers had actually bought. It was challenging to get a view of what was actually happening in the business. Having been at Oracle and seen what big firms had at their disposal, I knew that they had the tools to track what was going on overall in the business. Small firms needed the same.”
High bandwidth conversations



NetLedger's inception was aided by Oracle's Ellison, but was born from a remarkably short conversation. “Larry had been on the side helping me out,” explains Goldberg. “We talked about what I might do next. In the course of a five minute conversation – these were high bandwidth conversations! - I said that I was interested in looking at how the web could help smaller businesses to work better. He said to build something for accounting for small companies and then expand out into areas  like sales force automation. But start with building on a core of accounting information and customer sales information. 
“The system of record would have to have all the critical data on which you can grow an entire suite of information. It would need a centralised database. For smaller firms, managing and tuning a database like that would be beyond the resources of smaller firms so it would have to be delivered as a hosted service on the web. That hosted model has gone through many names since then, but Larry had been pioneering it with Oracle Business Online. This was taking the model to a new market of smaller firms. 
"I don't see SaaS as a limiting factor. The infrastructure we deliver NetSuite on is world-class, we have a world-class data centre. There's no reason why you can't provide a backbone for a larger company."
 Evan Goldberg, CTO, NetSuite“It was seriously a five minute conversation and then we had our heads down for a year. The result was NetLedger, an online accounting offering on the web at the level of QuickBooks, but all you needed was a browser. Nine years later, we have been building out from that. The suite spproach we've taken was a core idea in that first conversation, so as soon as we got done with the accounting piece we moved on to order management, ecommerce, then CRM and SFA capabilities. In the first five minutes of the company's history, we knew that was where we were going to go. If everyone in the business was to get a unified view of the business, it was the natural outgrowth of our vision.”
To date, NetSuite has focused on the SME space, seemingly adding fuel to the criticism in some quarters that SaaS is only appropriate for smaller firms. Goldberg disputes this. “I don't see SaaS as a limiting factor,” he says. “In a lot of ways, the limiting factor is infrastructure. The infrastructure we deliver NetSuite on is world-class, we have a world-class data centre. With that, there's no reason why you can't provide a backbone for a larger company. It's more about the application itself. Mid-sized companies get to the level where they're using a Sage application, but their business is becoming more complex and growing. They need more unified business processes that go across the entire organisation. We can scale very well within that target.”
SaaS wars
In recent months, start-ups like NetSuite and Salesforce.com have been joined by traditional enterprise applications vendors such as SAP and Microsoft in pitching into the SaaS market, but Goldberg does not regard this new competition as necessarily a safer bet for customers. “Version 1 of a product is not necessarily going to be safer than one that's been out for nine years,” he argues. “But SAP and Microsoft will legitimise the SaaS model for running the business. They will get a lot more eyeballs looking at SaaS as alternative to the traditional model so from that point of view it's a positive move.
"SAP and Microsoft will legitimise the SaaS model for running the business. They will get a lot more eyeballs looking at SaaS as alternative to the traditional model."
 Evan Goldberg, CTO, NetSuite“When DB2 from IBM came out, the big fear at Oracle was not that DB2 was coming out, but that it might not be any good and turn people off relational databases. So I hope to some degree that SAP's Business ByDesign is a good product so that people can see SaaS is viable as a model. The next stage is to recognise that the suite approach is viable. When CEOs see our CEO's dashboard, they think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Once they get that it's possible, then you come down to looking at actual products, references, customisation and so on. These are not impulse purchases.”
So will the SaaS wars of the 21st century be akin to the Oracle v Ingres database wars of the 1990s? “Oracle and Ingres were doing very similar things so you were comparing apples to apples,” suggests Goldberg. “NetSuite and Salesforce.com are doing different things, which are both legitimate. They are delivering a narrow application of sales force automation to the widest range of companies from small to large; we are delivering an application for a broader set of core processes. So the head to head aspect of the database wars is not really there.”
Quantitative and logical Larry
Last year, NetSuite went public, an event which put the spotlight back on Larry Ellison's majority holding in the firm, although the Oracle boss does not play as active a role as it might be assumed he does. “Larry has been involved from the very beginning and he has been the catalyst,” explains Goldberg. “Subsequently that involvement has not been as intensive perhaps, but he has been incredibly helpful. He has a very objective way of approaching business problems. He's a great supporter of the dashboard approach to make sure you have all the information you need to make decisions. He has a very quantitative and logical way of looking at business problems.
"What I find exciting about the future is the notion that you have this great juggernaut of information out there so that you can give business owners more than just data and charts."
 Evan Goldberg, CTO, NetSuite“What I find exciting about the future is the notion that you have this great juggernaut of information out there so that you can give business owners more than just data and charts. It's the eternal dilemma of the computer in general – there's always more that you can do. You want some intelligence about how you use data to get ahead of the curve. 
"One of the things I'm most excited about is the Upsell Manager. Because we have all the purchase information whatever channel your product has been sold through, we can trawl patterns that can help you to sell better. If you have products with a high margin and can identify why customer A has bought them and not customer B, then you can target customers better. The ones who haven't bought could be good ones to call. You might call it operational analytics, but if we can provide intelligent assistance to the business owner then that's exciting.”

      Whoopi Goldberg  launches marijuana products for menstrual relief  Goldberg  launches marijuana products for menstrual relief   BY  Jessica Schladebeck   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, March 30, 2016, 2:58 PM     facebook   Tweet   email          Whoopi Goldberg, a long-time cannabis advocate, on Wednesday announced the launch of her medical marijuana prodcut, designed specifically for women. (Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)       BY  Jessica Schladebeck   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, March 30, 2016, 2:58 PM    
	Whoopi Goldberg wants to solve menstrual woes with marijuana.

	Goldberg, who in the past has referred to her relationship with her kush-filled vape pen as a “love story,” on Wednesday announced she’d be launching a line of weed-infused products designed specifically for women.

	The long-time weed advocate has teamed up with Maya Elisabeth - founder of Om Edibles, which has won several awards since its debut in 2008 - to create the company, “Whoopi & Maya.”

	Products include Soak, an Epsom salt available in three scents; Savor, a sipping chocolate available in several sizes; and Rub, a topical oil with a beeswax base . The line also boasts Relax, a THC-infused tincture which supposedly mirrors a similar method used by Queen Victoria of England to relieve her menstrual cramps.

	Goldberg in an interview with Vanity Fair said one of her sources of inspiration was her adult granddaughters, who suffer from severe menstrual cramps. She added her vaping pen had worked so well for her glaucoma-related headaches, she was sure it could be applied to other health issues too.

	Her goal was to create a product that was discreet, yet still provided relief.

	“This, you can put it in your purse,” Goldberg told Vanity Fair. “You can put the rub on your lower stomach and lower back at work, and then when you get home you can get in the tub for a soak or make tea, and it allows you to continue to work throughout the day.”

	And for those with less experience with marijuana, Whoopi & Maya will also include products with only cannabidiol, which does not yield the euphoric effects often associated with the drug.

	Golberg isn’t the first celebrity to jump into the weed market, which has become one of the country’s fastest growing industries.

	Bob Marley’s family has partnered with a cannabis company to produce Marley Natural Products and Snoop Dogg has recently launched Leafs by Snoop.

	The Whoopi & Maya line is scheduled to be available in April, though courtesy of the federal ban on marijuana, it will - for now - only be sold in California.
