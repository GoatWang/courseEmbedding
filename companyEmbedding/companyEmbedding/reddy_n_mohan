Jagan Mohan Reddy is Bahubali in corruption, says TD


			DECCAN CHRONICLE.Published  Jul 10, 2017, 2:03 am ISTUpdated  Jul 10, 2017, 2:03 am IST

 YSRC chief had not disclosed his Lotus Pond in affidavit.




  YSRC president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy



Vijayawada: A long list of TD ministers and leaders bitterly criticised YSRC president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for his allegation of massive corruption in the government, during the party’s plenary at Guntur on Saturday. The YSRC also released a book, “Emperor of Corruption” that was aimed at Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.
Minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy called Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy the “Bahubali” on corruption. He said Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy should give way to poll strategist Prashant Kishor whom he had brought in as he was unable to run the party.
Excise minister K.S. Jawahar said the YSRC plenary was like a promotional programme of Mr Kishor. He said the YSRC should appoint Mr Kishor as its chief as Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy would be jailed soon.
Legislator Jyothula Nehru, who defected to the TD, said he had left the YSRC as he disliked the attitude of Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy. TD legislators G.V. Anjaneyulu and Alapati Raja alleged that the YSRC plenary was organised only to criticise Mr Naidu.
Mr Chandramohan Reddy demanded that the YSRC president explain where the alleged corruption of Rs 3.75 lakh crore had occurred. He said 24,000 farmers had died during the Congress regime from 2004-14, while the TD government had waived Rs 24,000 crore farmer loans in three years. He said it was not right for Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was the first accused in several cases, to criticise the TD. He alleged that the YSRC chief had not disclosed his Lotus Pond house in Hyderabad, Yelahanka house and Mantri Developers’ commercial complexes in Bengaluru in his election affidavit.
Energy minister Kala Venkat Rao criticised the YSRC for holding its plenary at a place where it had opposed the construction of the capital Amaravati. He said the YSRC president had no intention of serving the public; he was running the party to escape from cases.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister K.E. Krishna Murthy said anything could happen in politics but Jagan could never become Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He said Jagan is ‘no  Chief Minister stuff.”
“An actor son aspires to become an actor. A doctor son may become a doctor. But this son of former CM could never become Chief Minister,”,he said. He said that the repeated chant of bringing back Rajanna regime only confirms the worst fears that scams that riddled YSR regime  would be back again.

Defining Product Value in Industrial MarketsArticle · December 1991 with 14 ReadsDOI: 10.1108/00251749110005294 1st N. Mohan ReddyAbstractThe search for a better grasp of the what, why and how of product
value is analogous to the quest for the Holy Grail. Just when you think
that you finally have a handle on it, the mirage fades away and another
appears on the horizon, full of hope. So go our efforts to understand
customer valuation of products. There exists a value definition at every
turn, but one is never too sure how they all fit together (if they do at
all!). This article attempts to reconcile the various definitions in the
search for an operational framework of product value.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text

Vartotojo suvokiama vertė daugelio autorių (Kotler, 2007; Avlonitis, 2006 a,b; Reddy, 1991; Snoj, 2004; Ge, 2002; Christopher, 1982; Snieškienė, 2009 ) apibrėžiama kaip suvokiamos naudos ir suvokiamos kainos santykis. Suvokiamą kainą, minėtų autorių teigimu, sudaro objektyvi įmonės nustatyta produkto kaina, transportavimo, instaliavimo, eksploatacijos ir kitos po pardavimo proceso patirtos sąnaudos. The integration of corporate social responsibility activities into the value creation model in pricing[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Consumers are more concerned about the surrounding environment and they take into account the social side of enterprises while making consumption decisions. It should be emphasized, that it becomes important for companies’ to revise the process of value creation development, to assess the need of consumers’ participation in the value creation process, to determine the potential mutual benefits. In this way, there is highlighted the link between consumers’ and business enterprises co-operation; that is especially important when the products of socially responsible companies’ are analyzed. The concept of product value is quite often investigated in scientific literature, but there is a lack of research that emphasizes twofold interpretations’ of the value concept. Also, there is noticed a lack of examination of how corporate social responsibility can create perceived value for consumers. It must be stated, that there remains a problem how to integrate the value creation of socially responsible companies products in the pricing process. The aim of the article – after analyzing how socially responsible companies’ can create value of their products, investigating the differences of twofold value concept, identifying the stages of value creation, to establish a model how to integrate the value creation into the pricing process.Article · Oct 2014 Deimena KiyakAgnė ŠneiderienėReadKaip teigia R. Vaitkienė ir V. Pilibaitytė (2008), vertė vartotojui yra siejama su santykiu tarp iš pagrindinio produkto gaunamos apčiuopiamos ir neapčiuopiamos naudos bei vartotojo patiriamų piniginių bei nepiniginių sąnaudų, įsigyjant produktą. Kiti autoriai (Reddy, 1991; Snoj, 2004; Ge, 2002) vartotojo suvokiamą vertę apibrėžia kaip suvokiamos naudos ir suvokiamos kainos santykį. W. L. Chang ir Y. T. Hong (2011) nurodo, kad būtent vertė vartotojui yra prielaida visoms kitoms vertėms. Consumers perceived insurance price survey[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: In order to increase the demand for insurance services in Lithuania remains a pressing problem to reveal how consumers perceive this service, which characteristic of the insurance products they emphasizes. The aim of the research – exam the consumer attitudes to non-life insurance prices and determine their perceived quality for insurance products as the insurance products value. It was established that consumers selecting an insurance company to insure focus not only on price but also on other factors – fast service, good claim compensation, insurance service after purchase, a high level personnel. Meanwhile, factors such as nice and modern office, Lithuanian capital company, loyalty to the same company, famous brand and the emotional satisfaction after the purchase of insurance by the users have been identified as less important when choosing in which insurance company to purchase the insurance products.Article · Oct 2014 Deimena KiyakLinara PranckevičiūtėReadAs stated by R. Vaitkienė and V. Pilibaitytė (2008) customer value is related to the relationship between the main product's produced tangible and intangible benefits and monetary and non-monetary cost of user-experience while acquiring the product. Other authors (Reddy, 1991; Snoj, 2004; Ge, 2002) define user's perceived value as the relationship between perceived benefits and perceived price. W. L. Chang and Y. T. Hong (2011) indicate that the value for the consumer is an assumption for all other values. CAUSAL SURVEY OF PURCHASE OF NON-LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS FOR LITHUANIAN CONSUMERS[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: On purpose to increase the demand for insurance services in Lithuania there still remains a problem of how consumers perceive this service as well as what components, influencing their decision to purchase non-life insurance products, they accentuate in the price of insurance service. Emphasizing the assumptions of sustainable economic development in Lithuania and attempting to form regional policy by means of research, the study was implemented in order to identify factors and causal relationships that determine non-life insurance product purchasing motives in Lithuania. The study conducted a survey of Klaipeda city residents who buy various insurance products in different insurance companies. In total 420 respondents participated in this survey. To verify the results of the research three tests were applied: Pearson‘s Chi-square test, Fisher test (Fisher’s exact) and Cramer’s V test. It was identified that friends’ recommendations do not affect consumer‘s choice for insurance products. Higher rates of benefits as well as flexible pricing policy were not important factors choosing an insurance company. High insurance product’s cost and unclear conditions set in the contracts do not encourage consumers to purchase them. In the course of the research significant relationships between the consumer’s choice to insure by specific insurance product and consumer’s discount-enhanced motivation to purchase insurance products were not observed. All measured insurance products did not reflect statistically significant correlations between the decision to get insured and the knowledge about the prices in other insurance companies. KEY WORDS: non-life insurance products, price, consumers’ perceived value. JEL CODES: C83; G 22; E30; L11; Y10; D46. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15181/rfds.v14i3.868Article · Sep 2014 Deimena KiyakLinara PranckevičiūtėRead an offering is highly situation specific. as "the utility or the outcome of buying a good or a service [an offering]…per se raises buyer performance" (Ravalad and Grönroos 1996 pp.22). The offering as a "value carrier" contributes to the buyer performance and must be perceived buy the customer as a greater net-value then the competitors' offering. Reddy (1991) does not speak about offering but he defines the product value in industrial markets as a two dimensions construct. The product value is an ensemble of economic and non-economic elements (one dimension) and intrinsic and extrinsic elements (second dimension). Intrinsic elements come from the product itself (they are the economic and nonUnderstanding the non-economic value of business relationships[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This article contains a review of relationship value literature which is structured by episode, relationship, and network level. We propose characteristic value dimensions in each level. The article concludes by a three levels and two dimensions framework of focal relationship value in business network. This value combines economic and non economic aspects and episode, relationship and network levels. "All relationships are valuable…,but some are more valuable than others." (Ford and McDowell 1999 pp.430) The value should be measured at the activity level (Porter 1985), also at the product level (Reddy 1991). But it is not certainly enough to measure its complexity in the business markets. That is why it is important to understand this complexity through the value of the business relationships. Business relationship value is also a problematic concept. "The value concept and value adding seem to be one of the most recent and popular trends today. However, the concept of value is multifaceted and complicated…." (Ravald and Grönroos 1996 pp.19). And Wilson said "value is a problematic concept which cannot be ignored" (Wilson and Jantrania 1996).

It was also early in recognizing that customers are not buying output, but rather the service capabilities of that output (Phillips, Ochs, & Schrock, 1999), and in recognizing the primacy of value-in-use in relation to value-in-exchange and assessing this use value in the context of the total cost of ownership (e.g., Mohan, 1991; see Lusch & Vargo, 1998). Well before lifetime-value assessments became important in " consumer " marketing, B2B marketing was developing metrics to analyze long-term value of customers (Canning, 1982). From Goods to Service(s): Divergences and Convergences of Logics[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: There are two logics or mindsets from which to consider and motivate a transition from goods to service(s). The first, “goods-dominant (G-D) logic”, views services in terms of a type of (e.g., intangible) good and implies that goods production and distribution practices should be modified to deal with the differences between tangible goods and services. The second logic, “service-dominant (S-D) logic”, considers service – a process of using ones resources for the benefit of and in conjunction with another party – as the fundamental purpose of economic exchange and implies the need for a revised, service-driven framework for all of marketing. This transition to a service-centered logic is consistent with and partially derived from a similar transition found in the business-marketing literature — for example, its shift to understanding exchange in terms value rather than products and networks rather than dyads. It also parallels transitions in other sub-disciplines, such as service marketing. These parallels and the implications for marketing theory and practice of a full transition to a service-logic are explored. Full-text · Article · May 2008 Stephen L. VargoRobert LuschRead full-textIn the literature pertaining to industrial marketing, value is not a function of price alone (e .g . Reddy, 1991) . It is rather a result of a ratio between benefits and price, which includes the costs of acquiring, transporting, installing and ordering the industrial product and the risk of failure (Fisk, 1980) .

(1) Shows a comprehensive picture of the main cognitive components of loyalty.

In this article, Mohan Reddy, John Aram, and Leonard Lynn suggest that the institutional scope for understanding technology diffusion, in addition to supplier and user organizations and industries, should include organizations that manufacture technological complementarities, institutions that possess vertical complementary assets, and the nonmarket sector. The nonmarket sector includes trade associations, professional societies, governmental agencies, independent research agencies, and public service organizations. The authors develop a set of propositions and discuss the implications of our framework for marketers of technical products.
