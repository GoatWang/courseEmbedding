Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Announces Management Changes
Jul 5 17
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (BBH) announced that Managing Director, Michael McGovern, was appointed Head of the Firm's Investor Services Fintech offerings, which include middle office services, Infomediary, and software-as-a-service technology solutions for asset managers and financial institutions. McGovern's appointment to this newly created position organizationally unites – and positions BBH to expand – its suite of data and technology solutions. Since 2001, BBH digital offerings have empowered clients to make better real-time decisions, manage business risk, and streamline investment operations. Demand for these capabilities has spiked in response to the market environment. Previously BBH's Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Head of Systems, McGovern will focus on data strategy and client information delivery channels – two areas that asset managers and financial institutions have increasingly looked to leverage for revenue generation, cost control, and product enhancements. Succeeding McGovern, Managing Directors Brian Condon and Lorrie Gordon have been appointed Co-heads of Technology for the Firm. Condon joined BBH from J.P. Morgan in 2016. At J.P. Morgan, Condon held numerous positions including Chief Technology Officer of the bank's Global Funds Services business, and Managing Director and Head of Product Development & Product Solutions for the Custody & Funds Services Business. Gordon joined BBH in 1994. She has held various leadership positions in Europe and the U.S., including Chief Development Officer and Global Head of Infomediary.

Overview[edit]
Brown Brothers Harriman provides advisory, wealth management, commercial banking, and investor services for corporate institutions and High-net-worth individual clients. Alongside commercial banking, the firm provides global custody, foreign exchange, private equity, and merger and acquisitions, investment management for individuals and institutions, personal trust and estate administration, and securities brokerage.

Currently, the firm has 38 partners,[4] and acts as custodian and administrator for $3.3 trillion and $1.2 trillion in assets, respectively.[1][5]
History[edit]




W. Averell Harriman, founding partner of Brown Brothers & Co.


After immigrating to Baltimore in 1800 and building a successful linen mercantile trading business,[2][3][6] Alexander Brown and his four sons co-founded Alex. Brown & Sons.[7][8] In 1818, one son, John Alexander Brown, traveled to Philadelphia to establish John A. Brown and Co.[9] In 1825, another son, James Brown, established Brown Brothers & Co.[10] on Pine Street in New York and relocated to Wall Street in 1833,[2] which eventually acquired all other Brown branches in the U.S.[10] Another son, William Brown, had established William Brown & Co. in England in 1810, which was renamed to Brown, Shipley & Co. in 1839, and became a separate entity in 1918.[6][7][10]
Following the panic of 1837, Brown Brothers withdrew from most of its lending business. Two of the brothers, John and George, sold their shares in the company to the other two brothers, William and James. During the recovery from this economic turmoil, they chose to focus solely on currency exchange and international trade.
Merger[edit]




Prescott Bush, an initial minority owner after the merger between Brown Brothers and Harriman Brothers


On January 1, 1931, Brown Brothers & Co. merged with two other business entities, Harriman Brothers & Company, a private bank[11] started with railway money, and W. A. Harriman & Co. to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Founding partners included:[12]


James Brown
Thatcher M. Brown, Sr
Prescott Bush
Louis Curtis
Moreau Delano
John Henry Hammond
E. Roland Harriman
W. Averell Harriman
Robert A. Lovett
Ray Morris
Knight Woolley
Ralph T. Crane
Ellery Sedgwick
James Robert
Abercrombie Lovett
Charles Denston
Dickey Phillips
Blair Lee Louis Curtis, Jr.
Lawrence G. Tighe


TIME's December 22, 1930 issue announced that the three-way merger featured 11 of 16 Yale graduates as founding partners.[13] Eight of the partners listed above, except for Moreau Delano and Thatcher Brown, were Skull and Bones members.[14]
After the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, the partners decided to focus on commercial banking, becoming a private bank, and spin its securities marketing and underwriting off into Harriman, Ripley and Company which eventually evolved into Drexel Burnham Lambert via mergers.
Harriman, a partner in the firm, was the ambassador and statesman responsible for the relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. Some historical records of Brown Brothers Harriman and its precursor companies are housed in the manuscript collections at the New-York Historical Society.

Overview[edit]
Brown Brothers Harriman provides advisory, wealth management, commercial banking, and investor services for corporate institutions and High-net-worth individual clients. Alongside commercial banking, the firm provides global custody, foreign exchange, private equity, and merger and acquisitions, investment management for individuals and institutions, personal trust and estate administration, and securities brokerage. Organized as a partnership, BBH has approximately 5,500 staff in 17 offices throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Currently, the firm has 38 partners,[4] and acts as custodian and administrator for $3.3 trillion and $1.2 trillion in assets, respectively.[1][5]
History[edit]




W. Averell Harriman, founding partner of Brown Brothers & Co.


After immigrating to Baltimore in 1800 and building a successful linen mercantile trading business,[2][3][6] Alexander Brown and his four sons co-founded Alex. Brown & Sons.[7][8] In 1818, one son, John Alexander Brown, traveled to Philadelphia to establish John A. Brown and Co.[9] In 1825, another son, James Brown, established Brown Brothers & Co.[10] on Pine Street in New York and relocated to Wall Street in 1833,[2] which eventually acquired all other Brown branches in the U.S.[10] Another son, William Brown, had established William Brown & Co. in England in 1810, which was renamed to Brown, Shipley & Co. in 1839, and became a separate entity in 1918.[6][7][10]
Following the panic of 1837, Brown Brothers withdrew from most of its lending business. Two of the brothers, John and George, sold their shares in the company to the other two brothers, William and James. During the recovery from this economic turmoil, they chose to focus solely on currency exchange and international trade.
Merger[edit]




Prescott Bush, an initial minority owner after the merger between Brown Brothers and Harriman Brothers


On January 1, 1931, Brown Brothers & Co. merged with two other business entities, Harriman Brothers & Company, a private bank[11] started with railway money, and W. A. Harriman & Co. to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Founding partners included:[12]


James Brown
Thatcher M. Brown, Sr
Prescott Bush
Louis Curtis
Moreau Delano
John Henry Hammond
E. Roland Harriman
W. Averell Harriman
Robert A. Lovett
Ray Morris
Knight Woolley
Ralph T. Crane
Ellery Sedgwick
James Robert
Abercrombie Lovett
Charles Denston
Dickey Phillips
Blair Lee Louis Curtis, Jr.
Lawrence G. Tighe


TIME's December 22, 1930 issue announced that the three-way merger featured 11 of 16 Yale graduates as founding partners.[13] Eight of the partners listed above, except for Moreau Delano and Thatcher Brown, were Skull and Bones members.[14]
After the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, the partners decided to focus on commercial banking, becoming a private bank, and spin its securities marketing and underwriting off into Harriman, Ripley and Company which eventually evolved into Drexel Burnham Lambert via mergers.
Harriman, a partner in the firm, was the ambassador and statesman responsible for the relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. Some historical records of Brown Brothers Harriman and its precursor companies are housed in the manuscript collections at the New-York Historical Society.

Creating processes where employees have to jump over multiple hurdles to get things done and then getting upset that things are taking so long is counterproductive. Create competencies, work on career growth and development, and give employees exposure to work with each other. It's one thing to preach about good culture but it's another to live it and bring it to life.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Brown Brothers Harriman Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Brown Brothers Harriman 2017-07-21 12:59 PDT Jun 28, 2017 Helpful (2)"Fund Accountant"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Loan Officer in Boston, MACurrent Employee - Loan Officer in Boston, MADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Brown Brothers Harriman full-time (More than a year)ProsFree time, shopping in downtown crossing during lunch hoursConsTeam leaders and supers do not care whether you exist or notShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Brown Brothers Harriman Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Brown Brothers Harriman 2017-06-28 23:20 PDT Jul 13, 2017"Life @ BBH"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookI have been working at Brown Brothers Harriman full-timeProsGreat company to start a career.

Pay is competitive.ConsThis place is not run like other orgs. "Hurry up and wait" is common here. Partnership management style slows down progress. Old culture here does not want to embrace changes. Meetings require meetings with various committees and nothing is centrally organized or well documented (too many cooks in the kitchen).Advice to ManagementManagement needs to be more transparent to employees. Preserve the culture that makes the bank good, but you will loose talent if you cannot adjust to modern times. Improve employee on-boarding.

Overview[edit]
Brown Brothers Harriman provides advisory, wealth management, commercial banking, and investor services for corporate institutions and High-net-worth individual clients. Alongside commercial banking, the firm provides global custody, foreign exchange, private equity, and merger and acquisitions, investment management for individuals and institutions, personal trust and estate administration, and securities brokerage. Organized as a partnership, BBH has approximately 5,500 staff in 17 offices throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Currently, the firm has 38 partners,[4] and acts as custodian and administrator for $3.3 trillion and $1.2 trillion in assets, respectively.[1][5]
History[edit]




W. Averell Harriman, founding partner of Brown Brothers & Co.


After immigrating to Baltimore in 1800 and building a successful linen mercantile trading business,[2][3][6] Alexander Brown and his four sons co-founded Alex. Brown & Sons.[7][8] In 1818, one son, John Alexander Brown, traveled to Philadelphia to establish John A. Brown and Co.[9] In 1825, another son, James Brown, established Brown Brothers & Co.[10] on Pine Street in New York and relocated to Wall Street in 1833,[2] which eventually acquired all other Brown branches in the U.S.[10] Another son, William Brown, had established William Brown & Co. in England in 1810, which was renamed to Brown, Shipley & Co. in 1839, and became a separate entity in 1918.[6][7][10]
Following the panic of 1837, Brown Brothers withdrew from most of its lending business. Two of the brothers, John and George, sold their shares in the company to the other two brothers, William and James. During the recovery from this economic turmoil, they chose to focus solely on currency exchange and international trade.
Merger[edit]




Prescott Bush, an initial minority owner after the merger between Brown Brothers and Harriman Brothers


On January 1, 1931, Brown Brothers & Co. merged with two other business entities, Harriman Brothers & Company, a private bank[11] started with railway money, and W. A. Harriman & Co. to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Founding partners included:[12]


James Brown
Thatcher M. Brown, Sr
Prescott Bush
Louis Curtis
Moreau Delano
John Henry Hammond
E. Roland Harriman
W. Averell Harriman
Robert A. Lovett
Ray Morris
Knight Woolley
Ralph T. Crane
Ellery Sedgwick
James Robert
Abercrombie Lovett
Charles Denston
Dickey Phillips
Blair Lee Louis Curtis, Jr.
Lawrence G. Tighe


TIME's December 22, 1930 issue announced that the three-way merger featured 11 of 16 Yale graduates as founding partners.[13] Eight of the partners listed above, except for Moreau Delano and Thatcher Brown, were Skull and Bones members.[14]
After the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, the partners decided to focus on commercial banking, becoming a private bank, and spin its securities marketing and underwriting off into Harriman, Ripley and Company which eventually evolved into Drexel Burnham Lambert via mergers.
Harriman, a partner in the firm, was the ambassador and statesman responsible for the relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. Some historical records of Brown Brothers Harriman and its precursor companies are housed in the manuscript collections at the New-York Historical Society.

Overview[edit]
Brown Brothers Harriman provides advisory, wealth management, commercial banking, and investor services for corporate institutions and High-net-worth individual clients. Alongside commercial banking, the firm provides global custody, foreign exchange, private equity, and merger and acquisitions, investment management for individuals and institutions, personal trust and estate administration, and securities brokerage. Organized as a partnership, BBH has approximately 5,500 staff in 17 offices throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Currently, the firm has 38 partners,[4] and acts as custodian and administrator for $3.3 trillion and $1.2 trillion in assets, respectively.[1][5]
History[edit]




W. Averell Harriman, founding partner of Brown Brothers & Co.


After immigrating to Baltimore in 1800 and building a successful linen mercantile trading business,[2][3][6] Alexander Brown and his four sons co-founded Alex. Brown & Sons.[7][8] In 1818, one son, John Alexander Brown, traveled to Philadelphia to establish John A. Brown and Co.[9] In 1825, another son, James Brown, established Brown Brothers & Co.[10] on Pine Street in New York and relocated to Wall Street in 1833,[2] which eventually acquired all other Brown branches in the U.S.[10] Another son, William Brown, had established William Brown & Co. in England in 1810, which was renamed to Brown, Shipley & Co. in 1839, and became a separate entity in 1918.[6][7][10]
Following the panic of 1837, Brown Brothers withdrew from most of its lending business. Two of the brothers, John and George, sold their shares in the company to the other two brothers, William and James. During the recovery from this economic turmoil, they chose to focus solely on currency exchange and international trade.
Merger[edit]




Prescott Bush, an initial minority owner after the merger between Brown Brothers and Harriman Brothers


On January 1, 1931, Brown Brothers & Co. merged with two other business entities, Harriman Brothers & Company, a private bank[11] started with railway money, and W. A. Harriman & Co. to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Founding partners included:[12]


James Brown
Thatcher M. Brown, Sr
Prescott Bush
Louis Curtis
Moreau Delano
John Henry Hammond
E. Roland Harriman
W. Averell Harriman
Robert A. Lovett
Ray Morris
Knight Woolley
Ralph T. Crane
Ellery Sedgwick
James Robert
Abercrombie Lovett
Charles Denston
Dickey Phillips
Blair Lee Louis Curtis, Jr.
Lawrence G. Tighe


TIME's December 22, 1930 issue announced that the three-way merger featured 11 of 16 Yale graduates as founding partners.[13] Eight of the partners listed above, except for Moreau Delano and Thatcher Brown, were Skull and Bones members.[14]
After the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, the partners decided to focus on commercial banking, becoming a private bank, and spin its securities marketing and underwriting off into Harriman, Ripley and Company which eventually evolved into Drexel Burnham Lambert via mergers.
Harriman, a partner in the firm, was the ambassador and statesman responsible for the relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt during World War II. Some historical records of Brown Brothers Harriman and its precursor companies are housed in the manuscript collections at the New-York Historical Society.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
