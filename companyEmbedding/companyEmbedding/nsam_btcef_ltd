Applicants’ Representations
1. The Fund is a Maryland
corporation that has registered under
the Act as a non-diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The
Fund’s primary investment objectives
are to realize capital appreciation and to
preserve shareholders’ capital, with a
secondary objective of generating
income through cash distributions.
2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited
liability company that is doing business
as the Townsend Group and is
registered as an investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of

1940 (‘‘Advisers Act’’). The Adviser
serves as investment adviser to the
Fund.
3. The Sub-Adviser is a Bermuda
limited exempted company and is a
registered investment adviser under the
Advisers Act. The Sub-Adviser serves as
the investment sub-adviser to the Fund.
4. The applicants seek an order to
permit the Fund to issue multiple
classes of shares, each having its own
fee and expense structure, and to
impose asset-based distribution and/or
service fees and EWCs.
5. Applicants request that the order
also apply to any continuously-offered
registered closed-end management
investment company that has been
previously organized or that may be
organized in the future for which the
Adviser or any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser, or any successor in
interest to any such entity,1 acts as
investment adviser and which operates
as an interval fund pursuant to rule
23c–3 under the Act or provides
periodic liquidity with respect to its
shares pursuant to rule 13e–4 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(‘‘Exchange Act’’) (each, a ‘‘Future
Fund’’ and together with the Fund, the

6. The Fund intends to make a
continuous public offering of its
common stock upon a declaration of
effectiveness of its registration statement
(File Nos. 333–214167 and 811–23200).
Applicants state that additional
offerings by any Fund relying on the
order may be on a private placement or
public offering basis. Shares of the
Funds will not be listed on any
securities exchange, nor quoted on any
quotation medium. The Funds do not
expect there to be a secondary trading
market for their shares.
7. If the requested relief is granted, the
Fund intends to continuously offer
Class A Shares, Class C Shares, and
Class I Shares. Because of the different
distribution and/or service fees, services
and any other class expenses that may
be attributable to the Class A Shares,
Class C Shares and Class I Shares, the
net income attributable to, and the
dividends payable on, each class of
shares may differ from each other.
8. Applicants state that, from time to
time, the Fund may create additional

classes of shares, the terms of which
may differ from the Class A, Class C and
Class I Shares in the following respects:
(i) The amount of fees permitted by
different distribution plans or different
service fee arrangements; (ii) voting
rights with respect to a distribution and/
or service plan of a class; (iii) different
class designations; (iv) the impact of any
class expenses directly attributable to a
particular class of shares allocated on a
class basis as described in the
application; (v) any differences in
dividends and net asset value resulting
from differences in fees under a
distribution and/or service plan or in
class expenses; (vi) any EWC or other
sales load structure; and (vii) exchange
or conversion privileges of the classes as
permitted under the Act.
9. Applicants state that the Fund has
adopted a fundamental policy to
repurchase a specified percentage of its
shares (no less than 5%, and not more
than 25%) at net asset value on a
quarterly basis. Such repurchase offers
will be conducted pursuant to rule 23c–
3 under the Act. Each of the other Funds
will likewise adopt fundamental
investment policies in compliance with
rule 23c–3 and make quarterly
repurchase offers to its shareholders or
provide periodic liquidity with respect
to its shares pursuant to rule 13e–4
under the Exchange Act.3 Any
repurchase offers made by the Funds
will be made to all holders of shares of
each such Fund.
10. Applicants represent that any
asset-based service and distribution fees
for each class of shares will comply
with the provisions of NASD Rule
2830(d) (‘‘NASD Sales Charge Rule’’).4
Applicants also represent that each
Fund will disclose in its prospectus the
fees, expenses and other characteristics
of each class of shares offered for sale
by the prospectus, as is required for
open-end multiple class funds under
Form N–1A. As is required for open-end
funds, each Fund will disclose its
expenses in shareholder reports, and
describe any arrangements that result in
breakpoints in or elimination of sales
loads in its prospectus.5 In addition,
3 Applicants submit that rule 23c–3 and
Regulation M under the Exchange Act permit an
interval fund to make repurchase offers to
repurchase its shares while engaging in a
continuous offering of its shares pursuant to Rule
415 under the Securities Act of 1933.

includes any successor or replacement rule that
may be adopted by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (‘‘FINRA’’).

applicants will comply with applicable
enhanced fee disclosure requirements
for fund of funds, including registered
funds of hedge funds.6
11. Each of the Funds will comply
with any requirements that the
Commission or FINRA may adopt
regarding disclosure at the point of sale
and in transaction confirmations about
the costs and conflicts of interest arising
out of the distribution of open-end
investment company shares, and
regarding prospectus disclosure of sales
loads and revenue sharing
arrangements, as if those requirements
applied to the Fund. In addition, each
Fund will contractually require that any
distributor of the Fund’s shares comply
with such requirements in connection
with the distribution of such Fund’s
shares.
12. Each Fund will allocate all
expenses incurred by it among the
various classes of shares based on the
net assets of the Fund attributable to
each class, except that the net asset
value and expenses of each class will
reflect distribution fees, service fees,
and any other incremental expenses of
that class. Expenses of the Fund
allocated to a particular class of shares
will be borne on a pro rata basis by each
outstanding share of that class.
Applicants state that each Fund will
comply with the provisions of rule 18f–
3 under the Act as if it were an openend investment company.
13. Applicants state that each Fund
may impose an EWC on shares
submitted for repurchase that have been
held less than a specified period and
may waive the EWC for certain
categories of shareholders or
transactions to be established from time
to time. Applicants state that each of the
Funds will apply the EWC (and any
waivers or scheduled variations of the
EWC) uniformly to all shareholders in a
given class and consistently with the
requirements of rule 22d–1 under the
Act as if the Funds were open-end
investment companies.
14. Each Fund operating as an interval
fund pursuant to rule 23c–3 under the
Act may offer its shareholders an
exchange feature under which the
shareholders of the Fund may, in
connection with the Fund’s periodic
repurchase offers, exchange their shares

of the Fund for shares of the same class
of (i) registered open-end investment
companies or (ii) other registered
closed-end investment companies that
comply with rule 23c–3 under the Act
and continuously offer their shares at
net asset value, that are in the Fund’s
group of investment companies
(collectively, ‘‘Other Funds’’). Shares of
a Fund operating pursuant to rule 23c–
3 that are exchanged for shares of Other
Funds will be included as part of the
amount of the repurchase offer amount
for such Fund as specified in rule 23c–
3 under the Act. Any exchange option
will comply with rule 11a–3 under the
Act, as if the Fund were an open-end
investment company subject to rule
11a–3. In complying with rule 11a–3,
each Fund will treat an EWC as if it
were a contingent deferred sales load
(‘‘CDSL’’).
Applicants’ Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(a)(2) of the Act provides
that a closed-end investment company
may not issue or sell a senior security
that is a stock unless certain
requirements are met. Applicants state
that the creation of multiple classes of
shares of the Funds may violate section
18(a)(2) because the Funds may not
meet such requirements with respect to
a class of shares that may be a senior
security.
2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides,
in relevant part, that a closed-end
investment company may not issue or
sell any senior security if, immediately
thereafter, the company has outstanding
more than one class of senior security.
Applicants state that the creation of
multiple classes of shares of the Funds
may be prohibited by section 18(c), as
a class may have priority over another
class as to payment of dividends
because shareholders of different classes
would pay different fees and expenses.
3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides
that each share of stock issued by a
registered management investment
company will be a voting stock and
have equal voting rights with every
other outstanding voting stock.
Applicants state that multiple classes of
shares of the Funds may violate section
18(i) of the Act because each class
would be entitled to exclusive voting
rights with respect to matters solely
related to that class.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
person, security or transaction or any
class or classes of persons, securities or
transactions from any provision of the
Act, or from any rule or regulation
under the Act, if and to the extent such

exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the
purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Applicants
request an exemption under section 6(c)
from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to
permit the Funds to issue multiple
classes of shares.
5. Applicants submit that the
proposed allocation of expenses relating
to distribution and voting rights among
multiple classes is equitable and will
not discriminate against any group or
class of shareholders. Applicants submit
that the proposed arrangements would
permit a Fund to facilitate the
distribution of its shares and provide
investors with a broader choice of
shareholder services. Applicants assert
that the proposed closed-end
investment company multiple class
structure does not raise the concerns
underlying section 18 of the Act to any
greater degree than open-end
investment companies’ multiple class
structures that are permitted by rule
18f–3 under the Act. Applicants state
that each Fund will comply with the
provisions of rule 18f–3 as if it were an
open-end investment company.
Early Withdrawal Charges
1. Section 23(c) of the Act provides,
in relevant part, that no registered
closed-end investment company shall
purchase securities of which it is the
issuer, except: (a) On a securities
exchange or other open market; (b)
pursuant to tenders, after reasonable
opportunity to submit tenders given to
all holders of securities of the class to
be purchased; or (c) under other
circumstances as the Commission may
permit by rules and regulations or
orders for the protection of investors.
2. Rule 23c–3 under the Act permits
a registered closed-end investment
company (an ‘‘interval fund’’) to make
repurchase offers of between five and
twenty-five percent of its outstanding
shares at net asset value at periodic
intervals pursuant to a fundamental
policy of the interval fund. Rule 23c–
3(b)(1) under the Act permits an interval
fund to deduct from repurchase
proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to
exceed two percent of the proceeds, that
is paid to the interval fund and is
reasonably intended to compensate the
fund for expenses directly related to the
repurchase.
3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the
Commission may issue an order that
would permit a closed-end investment
company to repurchase its shares in
circumstances in which the repurchase
is made in a manner or on a basis that
does not unfairly discriminate against

VerDate Sep<11>2014

13:41 Feb 10, 2017

Jkt 241001

any holders of the class or classes of
securities to be purchased.
4. Applicants request relief under
section 6(c), discussed above, and
section 23(c)(3) from rule 23c–3 to the
extent necessary for the Funds to
impose EWCs on shares of the Funds
submitted for repurchase that have been
held for less than a specified period.
5. Applicants state that the EWCs they
intend to impose are functionally
similar to CDSLs imposed by open-end
investment companies under rule 6c–10
under the Act. Rule 6c–10 permits openend investment companies to impose
CDSLs, subject to certain conditions.
Applicants note that rule 6c–10 is
grounded in policy considerations
supporting the employment of CDSLs
where there are adequate safeguards for
the investor and state that the same
policy considerations support
imposition of EWCs in the interval fund
context. In addition, applicants state
that EWCs may be necessary for the
distributor to recover distribution costs.
Applicants represent that any EWC
imposed by the Funds will comply with
rule 6c–10 under the Act as if the rule
were applicable to closed-end
investment companies. The Funds will
disclose EWCs in accordance with the
requirements of Form N–1A concerning
CDSLs.

fees. Applicants have agreed to comply
with rules 12b–1 and 17d–3 as if those
rules applied to closed-end investment
companies, which they believe will
resolve any concerns that might arise in
connection with a Fund financing the
distribution of its shares through assetbased distribution fees.
For the reasons stated above,
applicants submit that the exemptions
requested under section 6(c) are
necessary and appropriate in the public
interest and are consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicants further
submit that the relief requested
pursuant to section 23(c)(3) will be
consistent with the protection of
investors and will insure that applicants
do not unfairly discriminate against any
holders of the class of securities to be
purchased. Finally, applicants state that
the Funds’ imposition of asset-based
distribution fees is consistent with the
provisions, policies and purposes of the
Act and does not involve participation
on a basis different from or less
advantageous than that of other
participants.

Asset-Based Distribution and/or Service
Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit an
affiliated person of a registered
investment company, or an affiliated
person of such person, acting as
principal, from participating in or
effecting any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or joint
arrangement in which the investment
company participates unless the
Commission issues an order permitting
the transaction. In reviewing
applications submitted under section
17(d) and rule 17d–1, the Commission
considers whether the participation of
the investment company in a joint
enterprise or joint arrangement is
consistent with the provisions, policies
and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which the participation is on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d–3 under the Act provides
an exemption from section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 to permit open-end
investment companies to enter into
distribution arrangements pursuant to
rule 12b–1 under the Act. Applicants
request an order under section 17(d) and
rule 17d–1 under the Act to the extent
necessary to permit the Fund to impose
asset-based distribution and/or service

Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following condition:
Each Fund relying on the order will
comply with the provisions of rules 6c–
10, 12b–1, 17d–3, 18f–3, 22d–1, and,
where applicable, 11a–3 under the Act,
as amended from time to time, as if
those rules applied to closed-end
management investment companies,
and will comply with the NASD Sales
Charge Rule, as amended from time to
time, as if that rule applied to all closedend management investment
companies.

    4. The applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue 
multiple classes of shares, each having its own fee and expense

and EWCs.
    5. Applicants request that the order also apply to any 
continuously-offered registered closed-end management investment 
company that has been previously organized or that may be organized in 
the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled 
by, or under common control with the Adviser, or any successor in 
interest to any such entity,\1\ acts as investment adviser and which 
operates as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act or 
provides periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 
13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') 
(each, a ``Future Fund'' and together with the Fund, the ``Funds'').\2\

    9. Applicants state that the Fund has adopted a fundamental policy 
to repurchase a specified percentage of its shares (no less than 5%, 
and not more than 25%) at net asset value on a quarterly basis. Such 
repurchase offers will be conducted pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the 
Act. Each of the other Funds will likewise adopt fundamental investment 
policies in compliance with rule 23c-3 and make quarterly repurchase 
offers to its shareholders or provide periodic liquidity with respect 
to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act.\3\ Any 
repurchase offers made by the Funds will be made to all holders of 
shares of each such Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Applicants submit that rule 23c-3 and Regulation M under the 
Exchange Act permit an interval fund to make repurchase offers to 
repurchase its shares while engaging in a continuous offering of its 
shares pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and 
distribution fees for each class of shares will comply with the 
provisions of NASD Rule 2830(d) (``NASD Sales Charge Rule'').\4\ 
Applicants also represent that each Fund will disclose in its 
prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class 
of shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-
end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end 
funds, each Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and 
describe any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination 
of sales loads in its prospectus.\5\ In addition, applicants will 
comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of 
funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Any reference to the NASD Sales Charge Rule includes any 
successor or replacement rule that may be adopted by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA'').
    \5\ See Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure 
of Registered Management Investment Companies, Investment Company 
Act Release No. 26372 (Feb. 27, 2004) (adopting release) (requiring 
open-end investment companies to disclose fund expenses in 
shareholder reports); and Disclosure of Breakpoint Discounts by 
Mutual Funds, Investment Company Act Release No. 26464 (June 7, 
2004) (adopting release) (requiring open-end investment companies to 
provide prospectus disclosure of certain sales load information).
    \6\ Fund of Funds Investments, Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 
26198 (Oct. 1, 2003) (proposing release) and 27399 (Jun. 20, 2006) 
(adopting release). See also Rules 12d1-1, et seq. of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11. Each of the Funds will comply with any requirements that the 
Commission or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale 
and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of 
interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company 
shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue 
sharing arrangements, as if those requirements applied to the Fund. In 
addition, each Fund will contractually require that any distributor of 
the Fund's shares comply with such requirements in connection with the 
distribution of such Fund's shares.
    12. Each Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the 
various classes of shares based on the net assets of the Fund 
attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and 
expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, 
and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund 
allocated to a particular class of shares will be borne on a pro rata 
basis by each outstanding share of that class. Applicants state that 
each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act 
as if it were an open-end investment company.
    13. Applicants state that each Fund may impose an EWC on shares 
submitted for repurchase that have been held less than a specified 
period and may waive the EWC for certain categories of shareholders or 
transactions to be established from time to time. Applicants state that 
each of the Funds will apply the EWC (and any waivers or scheduled 
variations of the EWC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class 
and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as 
if the Funds were open-end investment companies.
    14. Each Fund operating as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 
under the Act may offer its shareholders an exchange feature under 
which the shareholders of the Fund may, in connection with the Fund's 
periodic repurchase offers, exchange their shares of the Fund for 
shares of the same class of (i) registered open-end investment 
companies or (ii) other registered closed-end investment companies that 
comply with rule 23c-3 under the Act and continuously offer their 
shares at net asset value, that are in the Fund's group of investment 
companies (collectively, ``Other Funds''). Shares of a Fund operating 
pursuant to rule 23c-3 that are exchanged for shares of Other Funds 
will be included as part of the amount of the repurchase offer amount 
for such Fund as specified in rule 23c-3 under the Act. Any exchange 
option will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act, as if the Fund were 
an open-end investment company subject to rule 11a-3. In complying with 
rule 11a-3, each Fund will treat an EWC as if it were a contingent 
deferred sales load (``CDSL'').

Applicants' Legal Analysis

Multiple Classes of Shares

    1. Section 18(a)(2) of the Act provides that a closed-end 
investment company may not issue or sell a senior security that is a 
stock unless certain requirements are met. Applicants state that the 
creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 
18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect 
to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
    2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a 
closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security 
if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one 
class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of 
multiple classes of shares of the Funds may be prohibited by section 
18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of 
dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different 
fees and expenses.
    3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock 
issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting 
stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting 
stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the Funds 
may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be 
entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely 
related to that class.
    4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, 
securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any 
rule or regulation under the Act, if and to the extent such

[[Page 10518]]

exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an 
exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to 
permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares.
    5. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses 
relating to distribution and voting rights among multiple classes is 
equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of 
shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would 
permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its shares and provide 
investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants 
assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class 
structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act 
to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple 
class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. 
Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 
18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.

Early Withdrawal Charges

    1. Section 23(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that no 
registered closed-end investment company shall purchase securities of 
which it is the issuer, except: (a) On a securities exchange or other 
open market; (b) pursuant to tenders, after reasonable opportunity to 
submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be 
purchased; or (c) under other circumstances as the Commission may 
permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of 
investors.
    2. Rule 23c-3 under the Act permits a registered closed-end 
investment company (an ``interval fund'') to make repurchase offers of 
between five and twenty-five percent of its outstanding shares at net 
asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of 
the interval fund. Rule 23c-3(b)(1) under the Act permits an interval 
fund to deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to 
exceed two percent of the proceeds, that is paid to the interval fund 
and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly 
related to the repurchase.
    3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the Commission may issue an order 
that would permit a closed-end investment company to repurchase its 
shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or 
on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of 
the class or classes of securities to be purchased.
    4. Applicants request relief under section 6(c), discussed above, 
and section 23(c)(3) from rule 23c-3 to the extent necessary for the 
Funds to impose EWCs on shares of the Funds submitted for repurchase 
that have been held for less than a specified period.
    5. Applicants state that the EWCs they intend to impose are 
functionally similar to CDSLs imposed by open-end investment companies 
under rule 6c-10 under the Act. Rule 6c-10 permits open-end investment 
companies to impose CDSLs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants 
note that rule 6c-10 is grounded in policy considerations supporting 
the employment of CDSLs where there are adequate safeguards for the 
investor and state that the same policy considerations support 
imposition of EWCs in the interval fund context. In addition, 
applicants state that EWCs may be necessary for the distributor to 
recover distribution costs. Applicants represent that any EWC imposed 
by the Funds will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule 
were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Funds will 
disclose EWCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A 
concerning CDSLs.

Asset-Based Distribution and/or Service Fees

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from 
participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any 
joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company 
participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the 
transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) 
and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of 
the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is 
consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and 
the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 
17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter 
into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. 
Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under 
the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Fund to impose asset-
based distribution and/or service fees. Applicants have agreed to 
comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-
end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns 
that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution 
of its shares through asset-based distribution fees.
    For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions 
requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the 
public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and 
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
Applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section 
23(c)(3) will be consistent with the protection of investors and will 
insure that applicants do not unfairly discriminate against any holders 
of the class of securities to be purchased. Finally, applicants state 
that the Funds' imposition of asset-based distribution fees is 
consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and 
does not involve participation on a basis different from or less 
advantageous than that of other participants.

Applicants' Condition

    Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will 
be subject to the following condition:
    Each Fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of 
rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and, where applicable, 11a-3 
under the Act, as amended from time to time, as if those rules applied 
to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with the 
NASD Sales Charge Rule, as amended from time to time, as if that rule 
applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

articles on Mondaq (and its affiliate sites) � meaning more free content for 
registered users. 
We are only able to provide the material on the Mondaq (and its affiliate 
sites) site free to site visitors because we can pass on information about the 
pages that users are viewing and the personal information users provide to us 
(e.g. email addresses) to reputable contributing firms such as law firms who 
author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the 
Your Profile page. We and our author organisations may only contact you via 
email or other means if you allow us to do so. Users can opt out of contact when 
they register on the site, or send an email to unsubscribe@mondaq.com with �no 
disclosure� in the subject heading 
Mondaq News Alerts
In order to receive Mondaq News Alerts, users have to complete a separate 
registration form. This is a personalised service where users choose regions and 
topics of interest and we send it only to those users who have requested it. 
Users can stop receiving these Alerts by going to the Mondaq News Alerts page 
and deselecting all interest areas. In the same way users can amend their 
personal preferences to add or remove subject areas. 
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a user�s hard drive that contains an 
identifying user number. The cookies do not contain any personal information 
about users. We use the cookie so users do not have to log in every time they 
use the service and the cookie will automatically expire if you do not visit the 
Mondaq website (or its affiliate sites) for 12 months. We also use the cookie to 
personalise a user's experience of the site (for example to show information 
specific to a user's region). As the Mondaq sites are fully personalised and 
cookies are essential to its core technology the site will function 
unpredictably with browsers that do not support cookies - or where cookies are 
disabled (in these circumstances we advise you to attempt to locate the 
information you require elsewhere on the web). However if you are concerned 
about the presence of a Mondaq cookie on your machine you can also choose to 
expire the cookie immediately (remove it) by selecting the 'Log Off' menu option 
as the last thing you do when you use the site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and we 
are not aware of any at present that do so. 
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track movement, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to personally identifiable information. 
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Mondaq (or 
its affiliate sites) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information 
requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
functionality of the site. 
Mail-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friend�s name and email address. Mondaq stores this 
information and may contact the friend to invite them to register with Mondaq, 
but they will not be contacted more than once. The friend may contact Mondaq to 
request the removal of this information from our database. 
Security
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users� 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected using firewalls and other security technology. If you 
have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
webmaster@mondaq.com. 
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If a user�s personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that user�s personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the �Your Profile� page or by sending an email to EditorialAdvisor@mondaq.com.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, we will 
post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information 
we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
How to contact Mondaq
You can contact us with comments or queries at enquiries@mondaq.com.
If for some reason you believe Mondaq Ltd. has not adhered to these 
principles, please notify us by e-mail at problems@mondaq.com and we will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to determine and correct the problem promptly.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a Maryland corporation that has registered under the Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objectives are to realize capital appreciation and to preserve shareholders' capital, with a secondary objective of generating income through cash distributions.
2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that is doing business as the Townsend Group and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
3. The Sub-Adviser is a Bermuda limited exempted company and is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Sub-Adviser serves as the investment sub-adviser to the Fund.
4. The applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of shares, each having its own fee and expense structure, and to impose asset-based distribution and/or service fees and EWCs.
5. Applicants request that the order also apply to any continuously-offered registered closed-end management investment company that has been previously organized or that may be organized in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, or any successor in interest to any such entity,[1] 
           acts as investment adviser and which operates as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act or provides periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) (each, a “Future Fund” and together with the Fund, the “Funds”).[2] 

6. The Fund intends to make a continuous public offering of its common stock upon a declaration of effectiveness of its registration statement (File Nos. 333-214167 and 811-23200). Applicants state that additional offerings by any Fund relying on the order may be on a private placement or public offering basis. Shares of the Funds will not be listed on any securities exchange, nor quoted on any quotation medium. The Funds do not expect there to be a secondary trading market for their shares.
7. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to continuously offer Class A Shares, Class C Shares, and Class I Shares. Because of the different distribution and/or service fees, services and any other class expenses that may be attributable to the Class A Shares, Class C Shares and Class I Shares, the net income attributable to, and the dividends payable on, each class of shares may differ from each other.
8. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Fund may create additional Start Printed Page 10517classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from the Class A, Class C and Class I Shares in the following respects: (i) The amount of fees permitted by different distribution plans or different service fee arrangements; (ii) voting rights with respect to a distribution and/or service plan of a class; (iii) different class designations; (iv) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of shares allocated on a class basis as described in the application; (v) any differences in dividends and net asset value resulting from differences in fees under a distribution and/or service plan or in class expenses; (vi) any EWC or other sales load structure; and (vii) exchange or conversion privileges of the classes as permitted under the Act.
9. Applicants state that the Fund has adopted a fundamental policy to repurchase a specified percentage of its shares (no less than 5%, and not more than 25%) at net asset value on a quarterly basis. Such repurchase offers will be conducted pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act. Each of the other Funds will likewise adopt fundamental investment policies in compliance with rule 23c-3 and make quarterly repurchase offers to its shareholders or provide periodic liquidity with respect to its shares pursuant to rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act.[3] 
           Any repurchase offers made by the Funds will be made to all holders of shares of each such Fund.
10. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and distribution fees for each class of shares will comply with the provisions of NASD Rule 2830(d) (“NASD Sales Charge Rule”).[4] 
           Applicants also represent that each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-end multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, each Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and describe any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its prospectus.[5] 
           In addition, applicants will comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.[6] 

11. Each of the Funds will comply with any requirements that the Commission or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements, as if those requirements applied to the Fund. In addition, each Fund will contractually require that any distributor of the Fund's shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of such Fund's shares.
12. Each Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of shares will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding share of that class. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
13. Applicants state that each Fund may impose an EWC on shares submitted for repurchase that have been held less than a specified period and may waive the EWC for certain categories of shareholders or transactions to be established from time to time. Applicants state that each of the Funds will apply the EWC (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the EWC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Funds were open-end investment companies.
14. Each Fund operating as an interval fund pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act may offer its shareholders an exchange feature under which the shareholders of the Fund may, in connection with the Fund's periodic repurchase offers, exchange their shares of the Fund for shares of the same class of (i) registered open-end investment companies or (ii) other registered closed-end investment companies that comply with rule 23c-3 under the Act and continuously offer their shares at net asset value, that are in the Fund's group of investment companies (collectively, “Other Funds”). Shares of a Fund operating pursuant to rule 23c-3 that are exchanged for shares of Other Funds will be included as part of the amount of the repurchase offer amount for such Fund as specified in rule 23c-3 under the Act. Any exchange option will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act, as if the Fund were an open-end investment company subject to rule 11a-3. In complying with rule 11a-3, each Fund will treat an EWC as if it were a contingent deferred sales load (“CDSL”).
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(a)(2) of the Act provides that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell a senior security that is a stock unless certain requirements are met. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule or regulation under the Act, if and to the extent such Start Printed Page 10518exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares.
5. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
Early Withdrawal Charges
1. Section 23(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that no registered closed-end investment company shall purchase securities of which it is the issuer, except: (a) On a securities exchange or other open market; (b) pursuant to tenders, after reasonable opportunity to submit tenders given to all holders of securities of the class to be purchased; or (c) under other circumstances as the Commission may permit by rules and regulations or orders for the protection of investors.
2. Rule 23c-3 under the Act permits a registered closed-end investment company (an “interval fund”) to make repurchase offers of between five and twenty-five percent of its outstanding shares at net asset value at periodic intervals pursuant to a fundamental policy of the interval fund. Rule 23c-3(b)(1) under the Act permits an interval fund to deduct from repurchase proceeds only a repurchase fee, not to exceed two percent of the proceeds, that is paid to the interval fund and is reasonably intended to compensate the fund for expenses directly related to the repurchase.
3. Section 23(c)(3) provides that the Commission may issue an order that would permit a closed-end investment company to repurchase its shares in circumstances in which the repurchase is made in a manner or on a basis that does not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class or classes of securities to be purchased.
4. Applicants request relief under section 6(c), discussed above, and section 23(c)(3) from rule 23c-3 to the extent necessary for the Funds to impose EWCs on shares of the Funds submitted for repurchase that have been held for less than a specified period.
5. Applicants state that the EWCs they intend to impose are functionally similar to CDSLs imposed by open-end investment companies under rule 6c-10 under the Act. Rule 6c-10 permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSLs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants note that rule 6c-10 is grounded in policy considerations supporting the employment of CDSLs where there are adequate safeguards for the investor and state that the same policy considerations support imposition of EWCs in the interval fund context. In addition, applicants state that EWCs may be necessary for the distributor to recover distribution costs. Applicants represent that any EWC imposed by the Funds will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Funds will disclose EWCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSLs.
Asset-Based Distribution and/or Service Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Fund to impose asset-based distribution and/or service fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its shares through asset-based distribution fees.
For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants further submit that the relief requested pursuant to section 23(c)(3) will be consistent with the protection of investors and will insure that applicants do not unfairly discriminate against any holders of the class of securities to be purchased. Finally, applicants state that the Funds' imposition of asset-based distribution fees is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Each Fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and, where applicable, 11a-3 under the Act, as amended from time to time, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with the NASD Sales Charge Rule, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

author those pages. We do not sell or rent information to anyone else other than 
the authors of those pages, who may change from time to time. Should you wish us 
not to disclose your details to any of these parties, please tick the box above 
or tick the box marked "Opt out of Registration Information Disclosure" on the 
Your Profile page. We and our author organisations may only contact you via 
email or other means if you allow us to do so. Users can opt out of contact when 
they register on the site, or send an email to unsubscribe@mondaq.com with �no 
disclosure� in the subject heading 
Mondaq News Alerts
In order to receive Mondaq News Alerts, users have to complete a separate 
registration form. This is a personalised service where users choose regions and 
topics of interest and we send it only to those users who have requested it. 
Users can stop receiving these Alerts by going to the Mondaq News Alerts page 
and deselecting all interest areas. In the same way users can amend their 
personal preferences to add or remove subject areas. 
Cookies
A cookie is a small text file written to a user�s hard drive that contains an 
identifying user number. The cookies do not contain any personal information 
about users. We use the cookie so users do not have to log in every time they 
use the service and the cookie will automatically expire if you do not visit the 
Mondaq website (or its affiliate sites) for 12 months. We also use the cookie to 
personalise a user's experience of the site (for example to show information 
specific to a user's region). As the Mondaq sites are fully personalised and 
cookies are essential to its core technology the site will function 
unpredictably with browsers that do not support cookies - or where cookies are 
disabled (in these circumstances we advise you to attempt to locate the 
information you require elsewhere on the web). However if you are concerned 
about the presence of a Mondaq cookie on your machine you can also choose to 
expire the cookie immediately (remove it) by selecting the 'Log Off' menu option 
as the last thing you do when you use the site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, 
advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies and we 
are not aware of any at present that do so. 
Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track movement, 
and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
linked to personally identifiable information. 
Links
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Mondaq (or 
its affiliate sites) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read 
the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement 
applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
Surveys & Contests
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or 
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and 
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information 
requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode, age 
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the 
functionality of the site. 
Mail-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
site, we ask them for the friend�s name and email address. Mondaq stores this 
information and may contact the friend to invite them to register with Mondaq, 
but they will not be contacted more than once. The friend may contact Mondaq to 
request the removal of this information from our database. 
Security
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users� 
information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected using firewalls and other security technology. If you 
have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
webmaster@mondaq.com. 
Correcting/Updating Personal Information
If a user�s personally identifiable information changes (such as postcode), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that user�s personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the �Your Profile� page or by sending an email to EditorialAdvisor@mondaq.com.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy, we will 
post those changes on our site so our users are always aware of what information 
we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner 
different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with 
the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
