This is the Story of
the Little Steel Company 
That Could 







That could take “mini” technology and use itto become the nation’s largest steel producer.
That could redefine the rules on how steelis made and from what.
That could change the way the world looksat discarded scrap.
And this same little company that could …
Changed the way it managed.
Changed the way its employees viewed theirjobs and their company.
Changed the way it prioritized safetyabove all else.
And rocked the industry.

Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is an American producer of steel and related products. It currently ranks as the largest steel producer in the United States of America and is the largest "mini-mill" steelmaker (i.e. it uses electric arc furnaces to melt scrap steel as opposed to blast furnaces to melt iron). Nucor is North America's largest recycler of any material and recycled 16.9 million tons of scrap in 2015.[1] It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States.

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]

Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]

In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry.

That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]

All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.

Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]

Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Owners and Stakeholders
Every project has several stakeholders in the success (or failure) of the project. At a minimum you have the customer (recipient of the output of the project) and supplier (provider of the output of the project).
Usually the customer has the most at stake because he is depending upon the success of this project to make his programs or enterprise successful. He is also usually the main contributor of funds for the project.
The supplier enterprise on the other hand also has a lot at stake. In addition to the usual risks of customer dissatisfaction, reputation and cost overruns; the supplier enterprise has the ongoing success of that enterprise at stake.
Project’s Strategic Role
Projects are essential to the survival and growth of organizations. Failure in project management in an enterprise can impact the ability of the organization to accomplish its mission, objectives, and goals. The greater the use of projects in accomplishing organizational purposes the more dependent the organization is on the effective and efficient management of those projects.
Projects and Organizational Management
Projects, goals, and objectives must fit together in a synergistic fashion in supporting the enterprise mission. Project success by itself may not lead to enterprise success. However appropriately chosen projects may support and contribute to enterprise strategy.
Successful project management depends on senior enterprise management for authority, strategic guidance and support. Senior managers in turn depend on project managers for timely, cost-effective achievement of project results to support corporate strategy. Project management is a form of “strategic delegation” whereby senior managers delegate to project managers the authority and responsibility to do such things as building capital facilities, introducing new products, conducting research and development, and creating new marketing and production opportunities.
Project management is also a type of strategic management control. Senior managers can use project management as a way to ensure that key strategies are accomplished in an effective manner. A senior manager oversees the strategic direction of the enterprise through providing resources to accomplish mission, objectives, goals, and strategies.
The management of projects is inseparable from the management of the enterprise. Consequently, project success (and failure) will impact organizational success (and failure). Recognizing this, project owners need to be aware of the strategic context of their projects.



AN INTERVIEW WITH KEITH BUSSE, “PROJECT MANAGER”
Preface by Richard Kimball, PMJ Interviewer
It was my pleasure to have the opportunity to meet with and discuss the Nucor Flat Products Steel Project with Keith Busse. It was not long into our discussion before I was caught up in his enthusiasm with his job, this project, and the cultural ambience of the Nucor Corporation. Nucor is not a big company by many standards but it is unique in many ways. With sales in 1987 of $851 million, it has an executive management of only 19 monitoring the operations of 23 plants and 4,600 employees. The corporation has its own distinct culture which reflects Chairman and CEO, F. Kenneth Iverson's personal philosophy. They are proud of and boast at being one of the nation's low cost steel producers. It is a very entrepreneurial company which gives its management and employees a lot of responsibility and authority and encourages them to take prudent risks in meeting their objectives and job responsibilities. The company is very loyal to their employees, offering a high degree of job security. A portion of all employees compensation is based on the productivity and success of the corporation.
It seems as if every employee wears several hats. They have (1) a functional job assignment falling within a fairly rigid classical management structure, (2) a matrix structure of mutual dependence on each other in fulfilling daily tasks, and (3) frequent ad hoc assignments, many times in areas not associated with their functional responsibilities.
In many ways they are the antithesis of a project management organization as we in PMI would conceive it. For this project, Keith Busse, as the executive in charge, is as close as they come to having a project manager. Keith Busse's explanation is that Nucor is too small to maintain a formal project management structure
*          *          *          *
PMJ: What do you do with the people when the project is complete?



Busse: We do not have an ongoing series of projects at any one location to assign them to. It is our philosophy to assign a person their ultimate functional assignment and to assign them project tasks or responsibilities related reasonably close to their final role during the project implementation. For example we already have a traffic manager. Presently he is concerned with the problems associated with arrival of all the construction materials, storage, protection, railroad spur, roads, on site transportation, etc. When the project is operational he will then concern himself with arrival of raw materials, storage, transportation costs, and shipments of completed product, etc.
All but one of the people working on this project already is aware of what their future position will be. The one person not aware is the site construction manager, which illustrates my point! In this case he will probably be reassigned to operations management or another construction project somewhere as it is relatively easy to move one person. But, what do you do with fifty people?
PMJ: In reality you do have an informal project management structure. Through complex matrix relationships and ad hoc task assignments the project is going forth, and quite well at that.
Keith E. Busse, Vice President of Nucor and General Manager of Nucor’s new steel facility at Crawfordsville, Indiana, was a key member of the project team during the conceptual phase; and now in PMI terms is the Project Manager of the Implementation Project Team. When the project is completed he will continue as the General Manager of this new division. Mr. Busse started with Nucor in 1972 as Controller of the St. Joe Division and in 1979 became Vice President and General Manager. He has a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Saint Francis College and an M.B.A. from Indiana University. He was Project Manager for the development of Nucor’s Standing Seam Roof System and Project Manager for determining the feasibility of Nucor’s entry into the fastener business.
This was an extremely ambitious project for Nucor to undertake. Are you aware of the strategic motivations behind the decision for Nucor’s proceeding with this project?
Busse: Nucor is an ambitious company. We have been growing at a compound annual rate of 23% over the past ten years while concentrating our efforts in the steel industry. We would like to continue this growth. In order to do so we must expand our efforts into other growth areas. One of our main strategies is to grow within the steel industry. Our sales represent only a small percentage of the steel market and there is much room for growth for a low cost producer. It is our intention to seek areas in the steel business where we can make investments that will result both in reducing the cost of steel and increase our available market. While we might never become the biggest steel company, our long range objective is to become the premier steel company.
PMJ: I believe this is Nucor’s first venture into the flat products market. Can you comment on your strategies for entry into this marketplace?
Busse: As indicated in my last answer, we are seeking growth in the steel industry. Flat rolled products represent the largest market for steel products. While this is a new venture for Nucor it is not a new idea. The officers of Nucor have been considering this possibility since 1983. We have been actively planning this venture into flat rolled products for three years. We are convinced that with today’s technologies we can produce flat rolled products cheaper than others are now doing. If we can, there is a large additional market available to us. Not to mention that we can also be a source of lower cost flat products to our sister divisions. For Nucor this is a large project, but as far as the available market, we will only make a small dent — initially. With that in mind, we must learn how to crawl before we walk and walk before we run.
PMJ: Once the decision was made, what factors determined the organizational structure for the conceptualization and procurement phases of the project?
Busse: This was handled in the typical Nucor manner. A small group of Nucor executives and other key personnel were assigned the task of doing this in addition to their other duties. Ken Iverson, Dave Aycock, and I set out to determine the best site for the plant. Bill Dauksch, Joe Gedris, Howard Reardon and Ralph Smith had the assignment of scoping out the project and determining the major contractors. For all of these people this was a large additional responsibility added on to their already heavy schedules.
Nucor received a lot of help from SMS. They indicated they had perfected the technology Nucor was seeking and volunteered much assistance in helping us to decide exactly what we needed. They initially wanted to come in and provide the whole plant on a turnkey basis. While we appreciated their interest and assistance we wanted more control of our own destiny.
PMJ: Can you comment on the strategic factors involved in the selection of the Crawfordsville site?
Busse: That was an interesting challenge. After many months of searching, we identified several potential sites in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.
PMJ: Why did you concentrate in that area?
Busse: The midwest, including those four states and Michigan, represent the largest market (50 to 60%) for flat rolled steel products. These geographic areas also represent the best source for steel scrap. Since our process utilizes scrap, this was an important factor.
Another very important principle of Nucor is to build plants only in rural areas. We have generally found rural employees to have a better work ethic, to be more mechanically skilled, to be family oriented, to be more readily trainable, and to have motivation. We try to keep our facilities relatively small, under 500 people. In a rural area you can usually find 500 good employees within a thirty minute commute.
Another criteria was good transportation. Crawfordsville is on Interstate 74 and there are two major railroads in the vicinity. Electrical power was also essential and Public Service of Indiana had a 345 KV transmission line near Crawfordsville. The utility and Nucor eventually reached an agreement wherein Nucor would be provided power at an attractive rate, yet to the benefit of other ratepayers. The Nucor facility at Crawfordsville will be an enormous consumer of power.
Limited water was one negative concern, but on the other hand, we did not wish to necessarily locate on the Ohio River. We have another plant on the river in Arkansas and we did not want to compete with them for the available scrap coming down river. In this area we can get enough by rail and truck.
Another factor was cooperation from the state of Indiana relative to infrastructure grants and taxes. Conservative politics was also considered as a positive factor.
Land availability was also a key ingredient. We required over 500 acres of land with good soil bearing capacity. In Crawfordsville we were able to locate the required quantity of land. Of course we had to negotiate with fourteen different farmers. That was fun!
PMJ: What were some of the strategic factors Nucor considered in undertaking a large investment in the new SMS technology?
Busse: As mentioned before, we had already made the decision to enter the flat rolled products market. We were looking for a technology that would reduce the cost of making steel. We examined several different processes, visited many locations, heard many presentations, and had a good awareness of what was available.
The major factor for picking SMS was the fact that they already had an operating pilot plant. Others were saying they could do it but SMS had already done it. SMS provided us great assistance in engineering and specifying plant requirements. Also SMS was very anxious to sell their first operating system. As a result we feel we obtained a good price for their equipment. Future purchases of these technologies may be slightly higher priced. SMS’s hot mill equipment also offered new technologies, such as Continuously Variable Crown control (CVC) (to produce uniform thickness across the sheet), and provided us with further opportunities to improve quality and reduce cost.
We also wanted to be first. We had a goal to reach and needed to proceed. Other companies are watching this project with much interest, but by the time it may take some of these organizations to react (2-3 years) and get operational, we will be producing quality low cost steel. Future developments are the result of one’s learning curve coupled with an aggressive dedication to new cost saving technologies. We still have a lot to learn but getting started sooner was important to us.
PMJ: How important is this project in the overall strategic thrust of Nucor?
Busse: Very. It is a key growth area for us. As we proceed we will have 20-25% of Nucor’s assets tied up in this project. We are looking for deeper penetration into the building products area also, but growth in steelmaking is a primary objective.
PMJ: That is a sizeable investment in one project. What if it should fail?
Busse: At Nucor no one talks of failure. The possibility of failure is very remote. While we are talking about new technology we have to recognize that almost everything, with the exception of the caster, has been successfully done before. We are utilizing different combinations and more modern equipment but are basically just improving old processes to be more efficient and more productive. If a serious performance situation should arise there are alternate technologies available.
PMJ: This alternate approach would result in significant delay and additional cost. Wouldn’t this have a serious financial impact on Nucor?
Busse: Of course it would have a serious impact and we are doing all we can to avoid any such scenario. The timetable would get set back and the cost overruns and carrying cost of our investment would have significant impact on our financial statements, but it would not break us. The majority of our investment is from internal sources so we will not have unreasonably large debt obligations. It might cause us to delay or postpone other future investments, though.
PMJ: As Project Manager what are your specific objectives and what factors will be measured in determining your success in meeting said objectives?
Busse: One primary objective is to reach capacity production within the shortest possible time, while maintaining good cost control as it relates to capital, staffing and overhead. To me this means 800,000 or more tons of steel by 1991.
Another key objective is to produce quality products at minimum cost more effectively than anyone else has done. To me this means $50-75 less per ton than the cost of producing this same steel today.
It is also my objective and desire to maintain positive working relationships with employees and management.
PMJ: In most companies the transition from the procurement team to the implementation team can be difficult. In this project how long did this transition take and were there any specific challenges that you would like to comment on?
Busse: Generally the transition went quite smoothly. I had been involved in the project as a member of management and I also had the lead in determination of the site.
In this project it was more a change from the conceptual team to the operating team. We are still procuring new materials and equipment. Basically the conceptual team identified the major contributors, i.e., SMS, Westinghouse, Production Machinery, Klockner, Ebner, etc.
In April of 1987, I was advised that I was the person chosen to head up this project and the resulting division. This provided me several months of overlap with the conceptual team. In June we finalized negotiations for the site and in July we were on site.
PMJ: How often do you have project reviews with your management and at what level in the corporation are these reviews conducted?
Busse: At Nucor we have a small close knit management team and are always in contact with each other. As a result we don’t need to have all that many formal reviews. We do get together frequently to discuss specific issues. We submit statistical and status reports to Charlotte weekly. We also have on site reviews weekly among the management team here at site.
PMJ: What organizational factors were utilized in the determination and selection of the Nucor Project Management team?
Busse: We function in a complex matrix system and as such we must have very flexible and very compatible people. People compatibility is a must for us. For any job we hire about one out of every eight interviewed. Each person who passes early screenings are given aptitude and psychological tests and is interviewed individually by all of the staff managers.
Even though we are in the steel business we do not have an abundance of steel making personnel standing by to step into new assignments in a quite different project such as this. As a result we needed to immediately begin building a team. We now have 23 management personnel in the division. Only four of us are from within Nucor. No one hired to date ever built a steel mill before. Kris McGee, the site construction manager, however, did come from U.S. Steel and has considerable steel construction experience. Most of the others are young managers brought in from various geographies and backgrounds in the flat rolled products area. We want people we can train in Nucor’s ways without having to “untrain” them first.
Our Construction Project Team consists of the construction manager (the only person without a defined future assignment), two field shift superintendents (one, a piping expert and the other, a mechanical engineer), one clerk/secretary, and three engineers (one electrical, one mechanical, and one civil). Each has daily construction responsibility for either the melt shop, hot mill or cold mill. The five engineers will be turn (shift) foremen in the mill when we become operational.
The Construction Team is supported by future operations management, i.e., cold mill manager, hot mill manager, melting and casting manager, maintenance manager, and their staffs. Maintenance support is in the form of three turn foremen, one day turn electrical foreman, and four electrical engineers. The melting and casting, hot mill and cold mill support comes from future turn foremen who have been hired on an ongoing basis. Our engineering department consists of the manager in charge, one engineer, two draftsmen, and a clerk. The aforementioned individuals have the responsibility for both construction budgets and schedules as well as future planning and gearing up for the operational side. They are responsible for the construction, capital, and operating budgets of their specific mill. They are also directly responsible for all manpower requirements and vendor relationships. How’s that for a complex project matrix!
When we get fully operational I expect we will have 35 managers at all levels and disciplines and 500 total employees.
PMJ: As a result of undertaking this project, has there been any significant organizational change within the Nucor Corporation to accommodate this project? Can you provide any examples?
Busse: A change like this can be readily accomplished due to the way we are organized. Basically two new divisions were created, this one and one for our new wide flange beam mill being built in Blytheville, Arkansas. I was replaced at St. Joe from within. This resulted in minimal change or disruption to the ongoing business.
PMJ: From the external view, Nucor is considered an organization that relies very heavily on its suppliers to provide a high degree of service and project management capabilities. Do you feel this is a correct assessment? If you do, is this primarily a tactical or strategic policy?
Busse: Yes, yes, and yes!
It is true Nucor relies very heavily on its suppliers and contractors. As I mentioned several times we are a relatively small company and as such we can’t afford to have special disciplines and skills waiting for an event to happen. When we buy a product or service we also buy brains and special expertise. This is a tactical approach but it evolves from our strategic decision to “run lean and mean.” For instance we may get involved in the need to build a substation once every five years, we don’t have the expertise for that nor the ability to keep current on the new developments in the electrical industry. When we need a substation we go to a Westinghouse or a BBC and we buy their product and their knowledge. We demand a lot from our suppliers, but once we have worked well together we are more likely to specify these goods and services in the future provided they remain competitive.
Another strategic decision is that we always do our own construction management. We are sure SMS could have done a good turnkey job for us, but it is our pocketbook and we want to control it.
PMJ: Are there any questions you would like to ask, or any other comments you may wish to make?
Busse: Not really, I believe we have about exhausted this subject. Generally we are pleased with the progress of this project and the suppliers’ and contractors’ performance. The only area we really misjudged was the amount of engineering required for a project of this magnitude. We have utilized Lockwood Greene and CSDI far more than anticipated. By the time we are finished our engineering costs will be double what we estimated. However, even so, we have been advised that our engineering costs are only about 20% of the historic engineering costs for a more conventional plant. Mills such as this may well pave the way for significant future changes in the steel industry.
PMJ: Thank you for your very informative and frank presentation of this project and an insight into the strategic thinking of the Nucor Corporation.



AN INTERVIEW WITH JEREMY C.T. THOMAS



Preface by Richard Kimball, PMJ Interviewer
In discussions with Jeremy Thomas it quickly became apparent that he is, and recognizes that he is, a stakeholder in the Nucor Flat Rolled Product Plant. He was personally active in both obtaining the order and its implementation. The process which is at the heart of this project is a development of Schloemann-Siemag A. G. of Dusseldorf, West Germany. The SMS Engineering Company is a U.S. subsidiary of the SMS group of companies. The technical name for this process is “Compact Strip Production” or “CSP.” The CSP process combines a new type of continuous caster with direct rolling in a compact hot strip mill. This process reduces the production chain from crude steel to hot rolled product dramatically by eliminating a heavy caster, slab conditioning, reheating and roughing facilities, and their accompanying high energy and operating costs. The development of this process was a very strategic decision for SMS and has required a very large investment. Once having made that decision, a strategic project such as this Nucor Project became imperative to demonstrate its commercial viability.
*          *          *          *
PMJ: According to Nucor, SMS played a very large role during the early stages of this project. Would you like to comment on that?
Jeremy C.T. Thomas, President and CEO of SMS, Engineering, Inc., was and remains very active in the Nucor Project. He has held his present position since 1986. Prior to that he was President and CEO of Mannesmann Demag Wean.
All of his working career has been associated with the steel and metals industry. From 1959 to 1972 he held various management and executive positions with United Engineering and Foundry Company. From 1972 to 1985 he held various executive positions with Wean United Inc.
He was born in London, England and served as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. He attended Harrow School in Great Britain, the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.
Thomas: Schloemann Siemag AG of Dusseldorf, West Germany, the parent company of SMS Concast, Montvale, New Jersey and SMS Engineering of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many others in this country, Europe, and Japan, recognized the need to develop a caster to produce slabs with a thickness closer to the required thickness entering the finishing train of a hot strip mill.
After much development work, a design was developed and a caster built in SMS’s own steel foundry at Kreutzal, West Germany. Concurrently, Nucor had been experimenting with casting 1.5 inch thick slabs for sheet steel at its Darlington, South Carolina plant using a different technology. In addition, U.S. Steel and Bethlehem were jointly working on a $28.8 million development project in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy.
As Dave Aycock, President of Nucor, was reported as saying in the January 7, 1987 edition of American Metal Market, the SMS technology “came along a lot faster than a lot of people thought it might,” and added, “It’s totally ready for commercial application.”
Tom Graham, President of U.S. Steel, in announcing the phase down of the U.S. Steel/Bethlehem/D.O.E. Project, stated, “If the wheel’s already been invented, allocation of further capital — public or private — would not seem prudent.”
To revert to your original question, yes, SMS played a large role in convincing Nucor that a flat products plant fed by a thin slab caster was a commercially viable concept. Nucor was continuously updated on the heats poured at SMS Foundry and the results that were obtained by further roll processing of these slabs in operating conditions.
PMJ: Obviously this was a very important project for SMS. Our readers would be interested in your comments as to the strategic importance of this project to SMS.
Thomas: As you can appreciate being the first to come to the market place with thin slab technology was very important to SMS. But, of equal importance was finding a company with the confidence in the process to commit the investment funds to proceed. Many others without Ken Iverson’s fortitude have shown considerable interest in the CSP process and are waiting for Nucor to come into production before making their commitments.
PMJ: I assume SMS has made a large investment in this new hot mill technology. Can you provide us any insight into the strategic factors considered in making such an investment?
Thomas: You are correct in your assumption. SMS committed many millions to this development which was foreseen as one of the most important developments in the steel industry in the past twenty-five years. The ability to install mini flat product plants at a reasonable investment cost, geographically located near to the end user market, was foreseen by SMS as a logical step for both developed industrial nations as well as for less developed nations.
PMJ: Nucor does not appear to be overly concerned in SMS’s ability to move from a pilot plant to a fully operational mill. Would you please comment on the strategic importance of the success of this plant to SMS?
Thomas: The strategic importance of this project to everyone concerned is fairly obvious. I do, however, concur with Nucor’s feelings. While the plant in our Kreutzel Foundry has been described as a pilot plant, it is in fact a full scale caster that could be located in a steel mill. The only limitation was the melting capacity at Kreutzel. In all other respects, it was designed as if for installation in a commercial operation. To date, more than 400 successful casts have been made with thicknesses of 1.5 inches to 2 inches and in widths from 47 inches to 62 inches.
PMJ: How does SMS manage its projects in general?
Thomas: SMS receives orders from its customers under different conditions. Complete turnkey, site management only, or equipment supply only, with supervision of erection. SMS has a complete staff to handle total turnkey projects and has installations in many countries of the world. Construction engineering and civil, piping, and electrical construction, together with equipment installation, is subcontracted to contractors with responsibility for these disciplines. In addition to acting as prime contractor, SMS has also acted as technical and commercial leader of consortiums formed to supply complete installations.
In the event of equipment only supply, SMS is normally called upon by our customers to supply the services of supervisors of erection who act in an advisory role to the customer’s contractors.
PMJ: Are you doing anything different or special on this project to assure its success? What is your project management structure on this project?
Thomas: On the Nucor project, we have responsibility for mechanical equipment supply only. Nucor has awarded separate contracts for electrical equipment, construction engineering, and the complete site preparation and installation. Supervisors of erection will be supplied to assist Nucor’s various contractors.
The main order for this project was placed with SMS AG of West Germany, who in turn, sub-contracted the USA supply to its USA subsidiaries, SMS Concast and SMS Engineering. Project management and customer contact is handled by the project manager in Dusseldorf who coordinates the activities of the three SMS companies in accordance with the agreed upon schedule with Nucor. Each company is responsible for its deliveries in accordance with the overall project schedule prepared and maintained in Dusseldorf.
PMJ: I understand a great deal of interest is being shown in this slab technology?
Thomas: Yes, that is correct. The consensus of opinion at the recent “Survival Strategies III Meeting,” held in New York on June 21 and 22, 1988, was that the future expansion and development of the mini-mills lies in their ability to enter the flat product market. Now, due to the greatly reduced investment cost for a thin slab caster and mill over a conventional mill, the ability to enter the market is within their reach.
At that same meeting, Mr. James A. Todd, Jr., President and CEO of Birmingham Steel Corporation, stated, “We also expect to grow from additional acquisitions and from participation in future thin slab opportunities.” He later added, “Mini-mills are ideally suited to seize this particular opportunity.”



PMJ: Are there any questions you would like to ask, or any other comments you may wish to make?
Thomas: Yes. Related to the subject of Nucor and thin slab casting technology, at the same Steel Survival III meeting in New York, Ken Iverson of Nucor announced, “One of the important new developments is a process for changing the nozzle with almost no interruption of the cast. Our original projection of 800,000 tons per year capacity was based on shutting down the caster every 3.5 hours, changing the nozzle and restarting after 45 minutes. The new method obviously provides the potential for increasing the capacity of the mill.”
Other new developments are being worked on and tested at our foundry in Kreutzel and continuing research will no doubt produce improvements to the technology.
PMJ: Thank you for your thoughts on the Nucor project and SMS’s important role in its success. We wish you and all of the other stakeholders in this project a continuation of what has all the appearances of being a very successful project.
An abridged version of a paper presented by Jeremy C.T. Thomas
The CSP Process allows operation of a flat rolled plant, with a capacity as small as 500,000 tons per year, or as large as 3 million tons or more. With moderate investment cost, attractive return on investment, and low labor costs, CSP provides unexcelled steel production efficiency.
The CSP Process combines a new type of continuous casting which produces slabs as thin as 1½ to 2 inches with direct rolling in a compact hot strip mill. Strip width can be as wide as 72 inches, the nominal size of steel rolled in conventional 80-inch hot strip mills.
Development
The Compact Strip Production Process is a development of SMS Schloemann-Siemag A.G. of Düsseldorf, West Germany. The SMS Group of companies is comprised of: a Continuous Casting Group, a Rolling Mills Group, a Press Group, and a Plastics Machinery Group. Schloemann-Siemag is the world’s largest producer of rolling mills. Concast is a pioneer in continuous casting. Concast and its associates have more than 400 installations worldwide, with over 1,300 strands.



SMS Concast Inc. of Montvale, New Jersey and SMS Engineering Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are whollyowned subsidiaries of SMS and are responsible for the parent company’s products and operations in North America.
New Concept: Very Thin Slabs
The basis of CSP is a new type of continuous caster which will produce very thin slabs rather than the conventional 6-inch to 12-inch slabs produced on today’s continuous casters.
The normal production route for making hot rolled strip involves a continuous caster which delivers the heavier slabs. From the caster, the slabs move to the slab handling area and then to scarfing stations and the slab reheating furnaces. When returned to the hot rolling mill line, slabs are first reduced on a roughing train and then on a six or seven stand finishing train. The total process from caster through slab reheating process, roughing train and the finishing train to hot coil entails a high energy consumption.
Contrary to this, the new CSP technology casts slabs only 1½ to 2 inches thick, immediately followed by direct rolling in a compact hot rolling mill.
Thus, the production chain from crude steel to hot rolled product is shortened dramatically, eliminating the costly investment of a heavy caster, slab conditioning, reheating and roughing facilities, and their accompanying high energy and operating costs.
System Components
Caster - With the exception of a unique funnel-shaped mold, the CSP continuous caster is designed with components already well proven in modern slab casting plants. The components are of lighter design for the thinner slabs.
Steel is supplied in the normal way from the casting ladle via a shrouding tube into the tundish and thence through a submerged nozzle into the mold.
The mold is the heart of thin slab casting technology. The top region is funnel-shaped to accommodate the submerged nozzle and designed for lowstress solidification of the strand shell. Parallel side walls allow rapid changing of strip width from the control pulpit. Because of high casting speeds, throughput capacity is the same or higher than conventional slab casting plants.
Soaking furnace - Upon exiting the caster, the slab goes directly into an in-line soaking furnace where temperature is equalized. Still in-line with the caster, the slabs then move directly into the hot strip mill, where they are rolled down to finished thicknesses.
Mill - This is a compact mill, developed specially for this application. While a conventional hot strip mill would have five or six stands, this unit can operate with only four or five stands depending on the maximum strip width and maximum final thickness.
The reduced heat radiation allows a lower finishing train entry speed and thus less drive power.
To test and verify the effectiveness of the thin-slab casting process, a full scale pilot plant at the Buschhuetten steel foundry in West Germany was installed. More than 300 casts have been made on a wide variety of steel grades. The slabs produced have had microstructures better than conventionally cast slabs, due to the high solidification rate producing a fine equiaxed primary structure with low central segregation. Rolling tests at another location were conducted, with results equivalent to those obtained from conventionally produced slabs.
The Nucor Order
At the end of 1986, SMS received the first order for a Compact Strip Production plant. Nucor Corporation committed to make the system the basis of a new greenfield plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana.
The plant is initially designed to produce 800,000 short tons per year, with a maximum casting speed of 240 inches per minute. Slabs will be cast from 1½ inches to 2 inches thick. Finished strip width will be a maximum of 53 inches. Maximum coil weight will be 24 tons, which corresponds to a 154 foot length of cast thin slab.
Nucor’s plan for this plant includes the following:

Initial cold-rolling, based on purchased hot band to begin in September of 1988.
Start-up of electric furnace and casting machine for initial hot-run and debugging phase in March of 1989.
Start-up of reheating furnace/hot rolling mill complex in April of 1989.

The Economics
The economics are uniquely attractive by all measures:

reduced capital cost
lower operating costs
relatively quick return on investment
improved yield and quality of product
savings in energy consumption
reduced inventory costs
a dramatic level of steel production efficiency

In the CSP Process, the steps between the caster and finishing train are eliminated — with equivalent savings in investment costs. There is no slab storage area, no need for scarfing nor slab marking, no need for slab re-heating furnaces, and no need for a roughing train.



Compactness of the system also is reflected in building size. A conventional 800,000 ton per year hot strip mill installed in New Zealand required floor area of 60,000 square meters. A CSP mill installation, also of 800,000 tons per year capacity, requires only 31,350 square meters, only 58% the size of the conventional.
The advantages of simplicity and compactness quickly translate into sharply reduced capital requirements.
The caster alone will cost 50% or less than a conventional continuous caster.


Table 1Costs Comparison (800,000 Tons/Year Plant)






Consider now a comparison of the mill complex part of the CSP system with a conventional installation. Savings are gained in all segments of the mill complex including furnace and related equipment, the mill itself, and the infrastructure. Basically, the mill segment may cost on the order of 55% more for the conventional plant. The overall investment cost for a conventional plant would be on the order of 65% greater.
Table 1 indicates the investment cost difference and also shows a 47% greater operating cost for the conventional plant.
In operations, improved yield reduces cost. There are substantial savings in losses due to crop ends... and in scale losses in the slab re-heat furnaces and roughing train.
Normally, a 20% in-process slab inventory is found in continuous casting plants. The elimination of slab storage reduces processing time from pour to finished coil by weeks. All together, these and energy and labor savings result in operating costs which would be 47% greater for a conventional plant.


Table 2Comparison of Energy Consumption (BTU/U.S. Tons)





Table 3Steel Production Efficiency



Savings in energy consumption also is a major factor. Table 2 compares energy consumption in BTU’s per U.S. ton for various processes. Energy consumption in all segments is significantly less with the CSP thin-slab/continuous casting direct rolling process, requiring only 15% the energy of ingot casting with cold charge rolling.
Finally, consider steel production efficiency. The United States integrated producers have been making good progress in this area, achieving a 1986 level of 4 manhours per U.S. ton.
In 1987 an extremely efficient U.S. integrated producer operated at 3 manhours per U.S. ton, with segments of some plants doing even better than that.
With the CSP Process, we anticipate the level of steel production efficiency to be LESS THAN 1 MANHOUR PER TON BY 1990.
James M. Fisher, Vice President, Computerized Structural Design, Inc.
Computerized Structural Design, Inc. (CSDI) has a long time relationship with many of the divisions of the Nucor Corporation. Thus, CSD’s involvement with Nucor Steel’s new Slab Caster/Hot Strip Mill is critical not only for the design of the new mill, but also to our total involvement with Nucor Corporation.
CSD is a consulting firm specializing in the design of industrial buildings, foundations and special structures. Much of the firm’s work centers around design-build projects which demand economical and innovative designs for our clients.
Our involvement with the Mill began as consultants to the General Manager, Mr. Keith Busse, during the site selection process. CSDI was called on to help evaluate soil conditions at the various sites being considered for the project. Soon after the site was selected, we were asked by Nucor Research and Development to design the structural steel and the building foundations for the Hot Mill and for the Melt and Cast Structure. Because of our previous experiences with Nucor, we knew that once they called on us to begin a project, we had to immediately organize our design team. Not a day could be lost because of Nucor Steel’s extremely tight schedule. The work on the steel design began in mid-August, 1987 with a “hand-shake” contract. Final shop drawings for the Hot Mill were approved by our office in mid-October, 1987, just two months after beginning our work. Simultaneously in October, 1987, we were asked to bid on the engineering for the equipment foundations for the Hot Mill. Again, knowing the demands that would be placed on the successful bidder by Nucor, we formulated our design team. From the point of view of the management at CSDI, there was a major risk in taking on the foundation work on the Hot Mill. This type of work is drafting intensive and required the resources of about one-half of our drafting staff. The danger related to the potential loss of other existing clients that might require services during this same period of time.
We were successful and obtained the contract. The project management system which was put in place began performing. In fact, we realized that we were not tapped out as far as our resources, thus, we negotiated additional foundation work with Nucor relative to the Caster and its foundation system.
This was a management trap in that we virtually eliminated any contingency that we had to handle new projects from other clients. The real blow to our project management came when Nucor told us to take over all foundation work associated with the cold mill. Our first response was no, we could not take on any additional work without jeopardizing the firm’s ability to respond to our other clients’ needs. Our negative response was not accepted by Nucor.
Thus, our project management system was reduced to management by crises and to putting out the biggest fires first. During the months of January, February, and March, record overtime hours were set by company personnel.
The record overtime is indicative of one aspect of CSDI management philosophy. We do not staff up for a given project only to lay people off when the project is completed. Instead, we ask for extra effort to deal with over-committed situations.
Currently, our work is under construction, and special effort is still required to answer field questions and process shop drawings in a timely manner. As an additional activity, we are making weekly visits to the site to resolve questions and clarify the drawings for the Nucor field personnel and the contractors.
For CSDI, our work at Crawfordsville has been significant in that it represented Nucor’s continued confidence in our firm. From a management point of view, the Nucor projects demanded a significant share of the firm’s resources, and understanding and flexibility was needed from all. CSDI has answered Nucor’s challenge, proving it’s hard to say no to Nucor.

AN INTERVIEW WITH KEITH J. ASCOUGH
Preface by Richard Kimball, PMJ Interviewer
It was my pleasure to meet with and discuss the Nucor Flat Rolled Products Steel Project with Keith Ascough. Mr. Ascough, who is now Manager, Control Systems Marketing for the Westing-house Automation Division, was the sales manager responsible within Westing-house at the time of this negotiation. He was instrumental in developing the sales strategy which ultimately obtained this order. As Mr. Ascough indicates in the interview, this order was of strategic importance to Westinghouse in getting them in on the ground floor in the development of a new approach to making flat rolled steel products. It also provided Westinghouse the opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of its new technology of fully distributed digital control to a complete steel mill.
*          *          *          *
PMJ: In discussions with Nucor and SMS it was mentioned that Westinghouse was involved in this project in the early stages. How did this come about?
Ascough: With a lot of luck actually. In the last quarter of 1986 Nucor was negotiating with electrical suppliers for another new mill in Arkansas to produce wide flange beams. During the course of these negotiations, one of Nucor’s senior electrical engineers visited Westinghouse to familiarize himself with the new drive control and automation system that we had developed using WDPF™, our all digital, fully distributed control system. We did not appreciate, at that time, the importance of that visit and the effect it was to have upon our involvement with the flat rolled products plant.
In April of 1987, we received a motor list for the rolling mills from SMS and the pickle line from Production Machinery.
We went through our normal bid review process and made a positive bid decision. Having made this decision we set out to develop a bidding strategy to win this order. We knew if we used the same approach as was appropriate for the major steel companies that we would not be successful. From our knowledge of Nucor we knew that they would want a plant which combined low cost with maximum performance in operation, maintenance, and quality.
Keith J. Ascough is the Manager, Control Systems Marketing for the Automation Division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He holds a B.A. Engineering (Mechanical) Degree from the University of Sheffield in England. He has been with Westinghouse for three years. Prior to joining Westinghouse he has held a variety of management and executive positions with Wean United Inc. and been associated with the steel industry for over twenty-five years.
Initially these objectives seemed mutually exclusive, however, we were determined to give it a try. As we prepared our proposal we reviewed each cost contributing element and asked ourselves, “Can the plant run without this feature? What is sacrificed if we omit it? Is there a more economical way to do this while still fulfilling its basic purpose?” Our strategy, or objective, was to fulfill Nucor’s objectives efficiently, economically, completely and safely, but without luxury.
Having challenged ourselves with these questions at each stage, we finished our technical proposals and submitted them to Nucor. Each competing electrical supplier was given one day to review and explain their proposal and any features they wished to bring to Nucor’s attention.
The Nucor project review team consisted of three people from their Darlington Mill — the manager of rolling mill operations, manager of maintenance, and the same senior electrical engineer we had met the previous fall. Each of these people still maintained the responsibility for their permanent activities. This was our first demonstration of the Nucor culture in action. For a project as large as this most companies would have had a task force or project team devoted exclusively to this assignment.”



During our session with Nucor we were advised that our technical solutions and proposal were acceptable. The next hurdle was delivery. Their schedule was extremely tight and we could not provide all of our equipment to meet the required delivery. We sat down and developed a very detailed schedule, which although it did not meet their requested schedule, did commit to meet their installation and start up schedule. As a result, Nucor advised that we had made the short list of acceptable suppliers.
Following this, we had two more days of technical refinement with Nucor and SMS to assure compatability between the mechanical and electrical supply and two days for finalization of price and commercial conditions.
Nucor people are excellent buyers and pressed us hard until they were satisfied that they had the best combination of product, quality, price and commercial conditions. We were then advised that we had obtained the order.
PMJ: Westinghouse has been a leader in supplying electrical equipment to the steel industry for many years. Did this project have any special strategic importance to you?
Ascough: Yes it did. This was a very important and strategic order for Westinghouse. Westinghouse, as all other companies serving the steel industry, had gone through some difficult years. It was important to us to establish ourselves as the electrical supplier of this first revolutionary steel making process which has the potential to improve both the quality and to lower the cost of production.
We also saw this as a way to broaden our installed base, as we have not traditionally been a supplier to the minimills market.
Equally important was the opportunity to demonstrate the applicability of our own newly developed, fully distributed digital control system to a whole steel plant.
Also, the first application in the steel industry of this new control technology was in Spain. The timing of this project fit in nicely with the completion of several of our Spanish projects, allowing us to redeploy our returning project personnel efficiently.
PMJ: What methods or procedures are you utilizing to manage this project?
Ascough: This is a large order for the Automation Division and includes various Westinghouse products not produced by this division as well as a significant portion of equipment manufactured by other than Westinghouse.
The scope of supply includes electrical distribution systems, minicomputers, main and auxiliary motors (both AC and DC), regulation, control and automation equipment, systems engineering, spare parts, and field services during installation and startup.
Within Westinghouse, any large project of this nature is managed by a lead division which assumes full technical and contractual responsibility for the project throughout all stages until completion. The drive control systems department of the Automation Division is taking the lead for this project.
Simultaneously with obtaining the order from Nucor, a project manager was appointed to execute the contract. The project manager, Jack Wallace, acts as the primary interface with Nucor, SMS, other contractors and suppliers, and other Westinghouse divisions.
Assisting the project manager is a contract administrator whose responsibilities include interfacing with the accounting, financial, manufacturing, purchasing, traffic and other functional organizations causing essential documentation to happen in a timely manner.
In addition, each major production unit has a senior Westinghouse project engineer assigned; for example the hot mill, pickle line, reversing cold mill, etc. These project engineers are responsible for, among other things, the complete technical design of the electrical, drive and automation systems in that production unit and for coordinating systems common to more than one production unit with the fellow project engineers. Such common systems include the mini-computer system for schedule calculations, adaptive learning, and maintenance of engineering and production logs. In addition the WDPF control system connects all of the production units to gather and provide production information, setups, control, diagnostics, and data.
Due to the magnitude of this project, the Automation Division has assigned to one of its sister divisions — the Projects Department of the Commercial Division — the responsibility for the procurement of all non-Westinghouse manufactured products, the motors, and the electric distribution system. This includes the responsibility for design and procurement of the distribution system. In this way we can take advantage of the multiple skills and disciplines that Westinghouse has, while ensuring that Nucor still sees a single point of contact, the project manager, as the overall coordination point and responsible person for the performance of the contract.
PMJ: How is this approach working out?
Ascough: We believe it is working well. Shipments have already commenced and will be complete by the end of this year. Our Projects Department has been very active in assisting Nucor in determining their actual electrical distribution needs. Nucor’s expertise is in operating plants, not in designing them, therefore, we feel our assistance in this area has been beneficial to them. The project to date has run smoothly and any problems which have arisen have been resolved without difficulty.
PMJ: What type of review process do you utilize and to what degree is Westinghouse management involved?
Ascough: As I indicated, this is a very important project to Westinghouse. We have frequent reviews with Nucor, SMS, Lockwood Greene, and other contractors associated with this project. We also have internal management reviews. Within Westinghouse there is a lot of autonomy given to each division as well as each business unit. The division and business unit managements are frequently updated on the status and receive monthly reports. The project has been going so well that top management has been satisfied with the progress to date.
PMJ: What does this project mean to Westinghouse’s future strategic direction?
Ascough: This is a milestone project for Westinghouse. It appears as if the fortunes of the steel industry are turning around and we are poised to take advantage of this turnaround. We have a strong nucleus of drive systems engineering talent, the most modern control system in the world, high tech drive systems, and we are positioned in the Automation Division, a major growth segment of the corporation.
We hope to see several plants similar to this Nucor plant being built in the United States and overseas in the future. With the successful completion of this project, the process technology and plant operating experience should place us in a very good position in this marketplace.
A project of this type is in many respects a partnership between the owner and their major suppliers. This will provide all of us the opportunity to be learning the operating characteristics and performance of the new plant at the same time. This is an advantage both to Nucor and Westinghouse. Our past experience can be used to suggest to Nucor ways to optimize the operation and control of the process. And, of course, it will benefit Westinghouse by providing us new experience.
PMJ: Thank you for your informative answers regarding this project and an insight into the strategic thinking of the Westinghouse Automation Division.

E. Steve Helms, P.E., Lockwood Greene
Engineering Consultant’s Role
For the last several years, Lockwood Greene has made a concerted effort to serve the metals industry with fullservice project management, engineering, and planning. The company has been fortunate to work with numerous leading companies in the metals industry. The Nucor Steel project represents one of the largest and most sophisticated projects of its kind. Lockwood Greene has responsibility for installation engineering for all major mechanical and electrical systems, development of general arrangement drawings, coordination with all equipment suppliers, and project management of these efforts for Nucor.
Project’s Strategic Role
As the domestic steel industry continues its resurgence, Lockwood Greene is providing project management and engineering services which allow the steel manufacturers to accomplish necessary capital expansion while maintaining lean corporate engineering staffs. In essence, Lockwood Greene serves as the company’s internal project manager and engineering staff. The current project represents the first project for Lockwood Greene with Nucor Steel, and therefore, the first opportunity to establish a reputation with this steel industry leader. As the first continuous strip caster in the United States, the success of this project will be a benchmark for the steel industry as a whole. Lockwood Greene is, therefore, a major stakeholder in the success of this leading-edge project.
Project Organization
Due to the fast-track nature of the project, Lockwood Greene is utilizing three of its five major engineering offices to accomplish simultaneous engineering efforts for three distinct areas of the plant. The bulk of the engineering and project management is being provided by the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, office, including engineering of the hot rolling mill, melt shop, and outside utilities, total plant general arrangements, and overall project management. The engineering of the cold rolling mill is being performed in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, office, while engineering of the casting machine is being performed in Dallas, Texas. Lockwood Greene’s CAD system and corporate computer network allows effective coordination of a multi-office project team.



To ensure uniformity of design, coordination, and effective communication management, Lockwood Greene has implemented a tiered project management structure to oversee this project.
The Oak Ridge office has one senior project manager with the ultimate responsibility for management and coordination of the project within Lockwood Greene, between Lockwood Greene and Nucor, and between Lockwood Greene and other project participants. Each of the three offices has a designated project engineer who manages and coordinates the efforts of that office, and reports directly to the senior project manager.
In addition to the project engineers, each office has one team leader for each engineering discipline who manages and coordinates the efforts of that discipline, and reports directly to the project engineer. The team leaders in the Oak Ridge office also act as the first line of communication for coordination of efforts among offices within one discipline. In all cases, the project engineers are informed of all communication, and are always directly accessible to any member of the project team.
Communications Management
With well over a dozen companies as major participants in this project, communications management between Lockwood Greene and the other participants is of major importance. To ensure information transfer to the most appropriate persons, all Lockwood Greene project members are in direct contact with equipment suppliers, other engineering companies, contractors, and Nucor personnel as the need arises. All information transferred by means of telephone calls or meetings are documented in reports or minutes and transmitted to Nucor, all participants in the information transfer, and throughout Lockwood Greene.
The Lockwood Greene Senior Project Manager has support from a Project Controls Department for managing project communications. The Project Controls Department actually consists of separate Project Administration and Document Control Groups. Project Administration assists in maintaining all project accounting and progress track and reporting systems. Document Control handles the distribution, reproduction, master record filing, and processing of all communication flow, whether incoming, outgoing, or interdepartmental.
Project Team Success
The goal of all projects is the successful operation of the enterprise. To obtain this goal, all project participants must maintain effective management of human resources, costs, communications, and quality. As all project participants work towards the same goal, the spirit of cooperation is the primary key to the success of this project.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

How 353,000 lbs. Of Steel Can StrengthenA Nation’s Resolve.
The inspiring story behind the building of North America’s biggest flagpole.
Learn More >

 


A Record Of Perseverance We Can AllLook Up To.


After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Acuity Insurance in Sheboygan, Wisconsin wanted to erect an oversized symbol of freedom. They settled on an 80 ft. flagpole. Gradually they went higher, first up to 150 ft., then up to 199 ft, – a pole that toppled in a 2004 windstorm. So they erected a 338 ft. pole in 2007, then again in 2008. But due to buckling and swaying, they had to dismantle both. Instead of giving up, Acuity resolved to make the tallest flagpole in North America – and engineered it to last for 50 years.
“The goal here is inspiration.”
Ben Salzmann, President and CEO, Acuity Insurance

 



So Large, It CreatesIts OwnAtmosphere.
No kidding. In fact, it can rain inside this flagpole on a sunny day. But the most important atmosphere the flagpole creates is the one of reverence and awe that surrounds it when citizens, especially veterans, come to visit. And it isn’t just the giant flag and pole. At the flagpole’s base lies a patio made of bricks, each one honoring a Sheboygan County resident killed in active duty.

“This pole is so over-engineered, and so well-built, I don’t think we’re going to have an issue.”
Tom Jordan, Owner, U.S. Flag & Flagpole Supply, L.P.

 

Why North America’s BiggestFlagpole Is Made WithSteel From AMini Mill.


A Talk WithNucor Product Manager,Phil Bischof


Which mill was the steel from?
The steel for the Acuity flagpole was proudly manufactured right here at Nucor Steel in Hertford County, North Carolina.
What kind of steel is the pole made of?
High strength low alloy steel plate. Plate is the only kind of steel that we make here at Nucor Steel Hertford County.
Who was your distributor?
Our distributor for this project was Leeco Steel, based in Lisle, Illinois. We do a lot of work with them because they like the type of plate we provide.
And the fabricator?
Broadwind Energy out of Cicero, Illinois. They primarily make wind towers, so this project was right up their alley.
Why do you think Broadwind chose Nucor steel for the flagpole?
We make a high quality plate product that has good surface quality, which lends itself to fabricating these large flagpole sections. It also takes high gloss paint well. Also, they wanted more than 350 tons of plate from one source. We were able to provide that.
Did this project have special significance for Nucor?
It was interesting to see the flagpole go up and to be a part of it. Nucor promotes ‘buy America’ - we always try to buy equipment that is American made. Seeing a company like Acuity promoting America, in the heartland, is very encouraging. It’s something to be proud of.
 
 
 
 

An Impact That Will Be FeltFor Generations.
The huge flagpole is unquestionably a tourist draw. But a brick paver patio at the pole’s base, featuring the names of Sheboygan County residents killed in active duty, will remind visitors young and old of the sacrifices our flag represents. One visitor, a trumpet player named Jerry Kolb, drove all the way up from Kansas to play taps at the landmark. As Jerry put it, “It’s my way of giving back.”

“We couldn’t have hoped for a better response from the general public.”
Ben Salzmann, President and CEO,Acuity Insurance

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

How 353,000 lbs. Of Steel Can StrengthenA Nation’s Resolve.
The inspiring story behind the building of North America’s biggest flagpole.
Learn More >

 


A Record Of Perseverance We Can AllLook Up To.


After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Acuity Insurance in Sheboygan, Wisconsin wanted to erect an oversized symbol of freedom. They settled on an 80 ft. flagpole. Gradually they went higher, first up to 150 ft., then up to 199 ft, – a pole that toppled in a 2004 windstorm. So they erected a 338 ft. pole in 2007, then again in 2008. But due to buckling and swaying, they had to dismantle both. Instead of giving up, Acuity resolved to make the tallest flagpole in North America – and engineered it to last for 50 years.
“The goal here is inspiration.”
Ben Salzmann, President and CEO, Acuity Insurance

 



So Large, It CreatesIts OwnAtmosphere.
No kidding. In fact, it can rain inside this flagpole on a sunny day. But the most important atmosphere the flagpole creates is the one of reverence and awe that surrounds it when citizens, especially veterans, come to visit. And it isn’t just the giant flag and pole. At the flagpole’s base lies a patio made of bricks, each one honoring a Sheboygan County resident killed in active duty.

“This pole is so over-engineered, and so well-built, I don’t think we’re going to have an issue.”
Tom Jordan, Owner, U.S. Flag & Flagpole Supply, L.P.

 

Why North America’s BiggestFlagpole Is Made WithSteel From AMini Mill.


A Talk WithNucor Product Manager,Phil Bischof


Which mill was the steel from?
The steel for the Acuity flagpole was proudly manufactured right here at Nucor Steel in Hertford County, North Carolina.
What kind of steel is the pole made of?
High strength low alloy steel plate. Plate is the only kind of steel that we make here at Nucor Steel Hertford County.
Who was your distributor?
Our distributor for this project was Leeco Steel, based in Lisle, Illinois. We do a lot of work with them because they like the type of plate we provide.
And the fabricator?
Broadwind Energy out of Cicero, Illinois. They primarily make wind towers, so this project was right up their alley.
Why do you think Broadwind chose Nucor steel for the flagpole?
We make a high quality plate product that has good surface quality, which lends itself to fabricating these large flagpole sections. It also takes high gloss paint well. Also, they wanted more than 350 tons of plate from one source. We were able to provide that.
Did this project have special significance for Nucor?
It was interesting to see the flagpole go up and to be a part of it. Nucor promotes ‘buy America’ - we always try to buy equipment that is American made. Seeing a company like Acuity promoting America, in the heartland, is very encouraging. It’s something to be proud of.
 
 
 
 

An Impact That Will Be FeltFor Generations.
The huge flagpole is unquestionably a tourist draw. But a brick paver patio at the pole’s base, featuring the names of Sheboygan County residents killed in active duty, will remind visitors young and old of the sacrifices our flag represents. One visitor, a trumpet player named Jerry Kolb, drove all the way up from Kansas to play taps at the landmark. As Jerry put it, “It’s my way of giving back.”

“We couldn’t have hoped for a better response from the general public.”
Ben Salzmann, President and CEO,Acuity Insurance

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]
Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. The company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1966, to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant.[6]
Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972.[6]
In 1972 the company, recognizing that the company was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence.
In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology.[7]
DiMicco Era[edit]
In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions.
In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years.[8] In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations.[9]
In 2004, Nucor purchased Corus Tuscaloosa [10] and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel [11] and Marion Steel.[12]
In 2006, Nucor purchased Connecticut Steel,[13] Verco Decking,[14] and Harris Steel.[15] The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure.
In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market.[16]
In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States.[17]
In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel.[18]
Ferriola Era[edit]
Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman.[19]
In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.
In 2017 the company announced a $85 million program to upgrade the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. [25]
Nucor's divisions[edit]
Nucor consists of many subsidiary businesses[26] that operate independently, some of these companies include:

Nucor Corporation's steelmaking divisions are known collectively as Nucor Steel. Steelmaking operations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Washington. Nucor's steelmaking operations are based on the mini-mill concept, using electric arc furnaces and continuous casting technologies to recycle steel. The Nucor Steel plant in Louisiana and Nu-Iron in Trinidad, produce direct reduced iron, which is used in electric arc furnaces to supplement iron units in Nucor’s steel recycling operations. Duferdofin is a joint venture between Nucor and Duferco in Italy producing merchant bar.
Nucor Cold Finish facilities use hot rolled steel bar to produce cold drawn bar using a process known as drawing (manufacturing). These divisions are located in Canada (Laurel), Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.
Steel joist and engineered building divisions, include Vulcraft (AL, IN, NE, NY, SC, TX, UT), Nucor Building Systems (IN, SC, TX, UT), American Buildings Company (AL, IL, NV, VA), CBC Steel Buildings (CA), Gulf States (MS) and Kirby Building Systems (TN).
Nucor Fastener in Indiana produces carbon and alloy steel standard and special screws, bolts and nuts.
Harris Rebar is a leading fabricator, installer and distributor of concrete reinforcing steel and related products. Harris Supply Solutions is a national distributor of steel and concrete products including Steel Rebar, Black Rebar, Epoxy Coated Rebar, Fabricated Rebar and Steel Remesh. Harris Supply has warehouses across the US to serve their customer base.
Skyline Steel is a premier steel foundation supplier serving the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and Colombia markets.
The David J. Joseph Company is a world leader in scrap metal brokerage, ferrous and nonferrous metal recycling and transportation services.
Nucor Sales offices outside the US include locations in Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.
Decentralized Management Philosophy[edit]
Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO).[citation needed] Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations.[citation needed]
Performance Based Compensation[edit]
All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets:[30]

Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 250 percent of an employee's base pay.
Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay.
Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets.
Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock.

In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee.[citation needed]
Egalitarian Benefits[edit]
Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional "perks" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management.[citation needed] A letter was sent to the home of every Nucor explaining the why the jet was needed. It was important to Nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion. Ken Iverson’s book Plain Talk specifically pointed out that Nucor didn’t have a company plane, so it was seen as a big change. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the Nucor 2015 Annual Report,[31] it took 18 pages to list the names of all 23,700 employees.
Technological Leadership[edit]
In 1968, Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.[citation needed]
Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

Current operations[edit]
In 2015, the company produced and sold over 25 million tons of steel. Nucor operates 23 scrap-based steel production mills.[1]
Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap.
History[edit]
Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present).[3][4]
The Reo Motor Car Era[edit]
Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938.[5]
After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation.[5]
The Nuclear Corporation Era[edit]
The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed "Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted.[6]
The Nucor (Iverson) Era[edit]

In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company.[20] In 2015, the company acquired additional rebar facilities in Marion, Ohio and Georgia.[21] In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, TX,[22] and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama and Illinois.[23][24] The acquisition of these facilities will expand Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and add structural tube to the company's product mix.

The Nucor Culture[edit]
Nucor attributes its success to decentralized management philosophy, performance based compensation, egalitarian benefits, customer service, quality, and technological leadership. None of Nucor's plants, whether built from scratch or acquired, are unionized, and Nucor is opposed to unions, believing them to be a destructive force in the US steel industry. No Nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election, even though Nucor management has not engaged in the controversial "union busting" tactics adopted by some companies, and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage.[27][28] Nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates, working together towards a common goal.[29] Decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem, instead of up to management. That allows decisions and improvements to be made faster, and often better.

Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.[citation needed]
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Nucor is a member of the U.S. Green Building Council and has participated in other elite environmental programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Environmental Performance Track program.
Nucor has also sponsored construction of a regional butterfly aviary, launched a waterfowl protection project and helped preserve wetlands. Several divisions have environmental management systems that conform to ISO 14001 standards.
In 2000, Nucor settled with the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to resolve allegations that it had not adequately controlled the emission of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. The $98 million result was "the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer."[32]
In 2002, The University of Massachusetts Amherst's Political Economy Research Institute ranked Nucor as the 14th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution, due to the release of 760,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[33] However, by 2013, the same report ranked Nucor as the 69th largest corporate contributor to U.S. air pollution due to the release of 260,000 pounds of toxins into the air yearly.[34]
Nucor is considered to be the largest steel recycler in the U.S. “We have always been green,” explains Director of Group Sales Burt Shell. “NBS buildings average over 80 percent recycled content.” Projects fit with the industry trend of implementing green initiatives.[35]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
