Ultra-deepwater Rigs: Ocean BlackHawk, Ocean BlackHornet, Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean BlackLion
Listening to our customers, we decided to construct four ultra-deepwater drillships to further service their needs as well as diversify our asset base. We began by ordering our first newbuild drillship in Q1 2011 and by January 2012 had four drillships on order. In 2013, Diamond will commence operations in the US Gulf of Mexico for Anadarko utilizing the Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet.  In 2014, Diamond will take delivery of the Ocean BlackRhino and Ocean BlackLion both of which are available for contract.  These four identical ultra-deepwater drillships from Hyundai Heavy Industries are fleet changers for Diamond and the latest state of the art equipment in the industry.
Highlights: Dynamic-positioning, dual-activity capability, maximum hook-load capacity of 1,250 tons, two seven-ram blowout preventers, water depth capabilities up to 12,000 feet, and drilling depth capabilities up to 40,000 feet.  See Spec Sheet for further details: Ocean BlackHawk, Ocean BlackHornet, Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean BlackLion.

Video: The Ocean Endeavor Journey
 Video: The Ocean Endeavor Completes a Well-Planned, Perfectly Executed Journey
Loading the Video...



Early in 2014 the Ocean Endeavor was scheduled to move to Romanian waters, in anticipation of planned exploration wells in the area. But before any drill bit could bite into the silty sea bottom, the rig had to go through a series of carefully planned, perfectly executed steps to get there.
The mobilization phase of the project started in mid-January 2014, and some 174 days, 2,583 nautical miles and 130,000 man-hours later, the Endeavor commenced drilling its first well.




Typically when a contract ends, Diamond Offshore will relocate a rig anywhere in the world where it is needed next. In fact, contracts in recent years had seen the massive Endeavor towed from Singapore to the Gulf of Mexico to Egypt. In relative terms, this latest trip from Egypt to nearby Romania looked to be a quick and easy jaunt. But there were two very thin, yet very formidable obstacles standing in the way. 





Two sleek bridges soar 64 meters (210 feet) high over the Bosphorus, more than enough clearance for the world's largest ships to pass safely below. But the bridge designers didn't count on a seagoing vessel with an enormous pointed tip towering 115 meters (376 feet) skyward. To get the Endeavor underneath, the derrick would have to be taken off, laid down for the passage and put back up on the other side--in effect the most challenging limbo contest Diamond Offshore has ever attempted.




Breaking the Ocean Endeavor basically in half took a lot of careful planning. The disassembly approach began with reviewing how the rig had been constructed. Knowing that the derrick was built in three sections and the cranes go up piece by piece, the Diamond Offshore engineering team basically reverse engineered it.



The Ocean Endeavor was originally designed to work in tropical environments, so all the piping was exposed. To accommodate the Black Sea environment, about five kilometers of heat tracing were installed on the rig, and certain areas with a high concentration of piping and equipment were closed off. This was not only a good economical decision, but also makes for a cleaner rig. Important consideration was also given to the rig’s crew. The Endeavor was originally equipped with numerous air conditioners, but no heaters. As a result, 75 heaters were installed in different workspaces throughout the rig along with 14 tank heaters to keep potable water, salt water and drill water from freezing. With all this new equipment on board, eight power substations had to also be installed just to run the new equipment.




The Ocean Endeavor mobilization to the Black Sea spanned over a six month period and was the first of its kind in Diamond Offshore history. This is mainly due to the size of the rig coupled with the scale of the project, including the unique challenges of crossing the Bosphorus straight. A challenging project accomplished on-time and with no recordable safety incidents.

Diamond Offshore is committed to providing value to customers through safe and highly efficient operations. The introduction of Pressure Control by the Hour® is a new service model for deepwater drilling and a new way of thinking to drive continuous improvement in the industry. 
Subsea equipment repair and maintenance is a large cause of nonproductive time across the offshore drilling industry. Diamond Offshore’s Pressure Control by the Hour® service model includes performance incentives to reduce BOP system downtime and improve system reliability for Diamond Offshore and its customers.
In collaboration with GE Oil & Gas, Diamond Offshore will utilize GE’s engageDrilling™ Services offering to enhance BOP system availability on its four sixth-generation drillships. By transferring the maintenance and services of pressure control equipment to GE Oil & Gas, Diamond Offshore is simplifying operations and optimizing between well maintenance to reduce the frequency and duration of downtime. The combination of Diamond Offshore’s operational excellence and the incentivized performance of BOPs will promote the delivery of enhanced offshore drilling economics for our customers.
For more information, please reference the press release.

 The Ocean Technology Center Training Facility

Our training facility, The Ocean Technology Center, offers the most advanced training and full-scale simulation programs available in the industry today. The difference with our simulations and training programs is their connection to people - operators, drillers, managers, trainers and more - all working to deliver the most efficient and safest way to complete a task.
Leading edge electronic drilling and traditional drilling simulation
Diamond Offshore's Ocean Technology Center features multi-million dollar drilling simulation equipment for use in teaching drilling practices and well control. Additionally, the equipment can simultaneously replicate downhole geologic formations and well pressures and depths. Customers' project leaders can assemble team leads and their support and service personnel to work through a planned well with strategic procedures to address their specific project. This is the essence of building the partnership of managing a successful and safe drilling project. The Ocean Technology Center provides a designated space, along with technology and expertise, to help our customers and employees plan our shared projects together.

Spud meetings
At Diamond Offshore, the process of beginning to drill a well, or spud, is an opportunity to review the dynamics and critical components of the well. Diamond Offshore customers and teams from operations, management and training meet at The Ocean Technology Center training facility to review the approach to the well and discuss any challenges. The training team becomes a sounding board and consultant group to help assure the most efficient and safest operations at the rig.

Current operations[edit]
The company operates 24 drilling rigs including 19 semisubmersibles, 4 drillships, and 1 jackup rig.[4]
The company provides quarterly online updates on the status of each rig in its fleet.[5]
In 2016, Anadarko Petroleum accounted for 22.4% of the company's revenues, Petrobras accounted for 17.9% of the company's revenues, and ExxonMobil accounted for 5.8% of the company's revenues.[1]
Operations outside of the United States accounted for 66% of the company's revenues in 2016.[1]
History[edit]
Diamond Offshore's beginnings can be traced back to the earliest days of the offshore drilling industry. Its predecessor companies were ODECO, Zapata Corporation, and Diamond M Drilling Co.
Diamond Offshore’s roots date back to May 1953, when Alden J. (Doc) Laborde founded Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co. (ODECO) in New Orleans. Laborde had designed what was probably the first submersible drilling rig. After finding a financial backer in Charlie Murphy of Murphy Oil Co., a grateful Laborde built the rig in 1954 and named the unit Mr. Charlie in honor of his benefactor. Today, the Mr. Charlie is a museum and training facility in Morgan City, Louisiana.
After noticing the stability of submersible rigs when they were only partially submerged for relocation, Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built semi-submersible rig, Ocean Driller, in 1964. ODECO rigs continued to rack up “firsts” in the industry in the 1970s, with Ocean Viking discovering the giant Ekofisk oil field for Phillips Petroleum Company in the North Sea and Ocean Victory discovering the Piper oilfield and Claymore field, also in the North Sea, for Occidental Petroleum.
In the early 1960s the onshore drilling company Brewster-Bartle went bankrupt. The banks that had become the owners of the company’s rigs contacted Don McMahon to take over the failed company. McMahon accepted the challenge and formed Diamond M Drilling Co. in 1964. He named the company after Diamond M Acres, his ranch near Simonton, Texas. McMahon took his company public in 1970 and expanded into offshore waters with the building and purchase of jack-up, barge, and semi-submersible rigs. In the early 1970s, Diamond M was one of the largest owners of barge rigs in the energy industry. The company continued to drill both on land and offshore. In the late 1970s, Western Oceanic tendered an offer to buy Diamond M. Unwilling to be purchased, Diamond sought and found a “white knight” in Kaneb Services, Inc.
In 1992, Diamond M Corporation purchased all of the outstanding stock of ODECO Drilling Inc. from ODECO Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Murphy Oil. Shortly thereafter, Diamond M Corp. briefly changed its name to Diamond M-ODECO Drilling Inc. before becoming Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. in 1993. Diamond Offshore began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1995 and acquired Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd. in April 1996.[6]
Recent financial struggles[edit]
Since 2012, the company has retired or sold 12 rigs and recorded over $1.0 billion in impairment charges.[1]
On February 8, 2016, the company discontinued payment of a quarterly cash dividend.[1]
Controversies[edit]
Worker asbestos exposure[edit]
In 1989, Diamond's predecessor bought six drilling rigs from the predecessor of Kaneb Management Co. LLC. Some of Kaneb's employees continued to work for Diamond after the transaction and then sued Diamond for personal injuries they allegedly suffered from asbestos exposure while they worked for Kaneb.[7] In a 2013 filing with the SEC, Diamond acknowledged that their equipment had been used for the "manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud," but sought to be indemnified from liability.[8]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

 The Ocean Technology Center Training Facility

Our training facility, The Ocean Technology Center, offers the most advanced training and full-scale simulation programs available in the industry today. The difference with our simulations and training programs is their connection to people - operators, drillers, managers, trainers and more - all working to deliver the most efficient and safest way to complete a task.
Leading edge electronic drilling and traditional drilling simulation
Diamond Offshore's Ocean Technology Center features multi-million dollar drilling simulation equipment for use in teaching drilling practices and well control. Additionally, the equipment can simultaneously replicate downhole geologic formations and well pressures and depths. Customers' project leaders can assemble team leads and their support and service personnel to work through a planned well with strategic procedures to address their specific project. This is the essence of building the partnership of managing a successful and safe drilling project. The Ocean Technology Center provides a designated space, along with technology and expertise, to help our customers and employees plan our shared projects together.

Spud meetings
At Diamond Offshore, the process of beginning to drill a well, or spud, is an opportunity to review the dynamics and critical components of the well. Diamond Offshore customers and teams from operations, management and training meet at The Ocean Technology Center training facility to review the approach to the well and discuss any challenges. The training team becomes a sounding board and consultant group to help assure the most efficient and safest operations at the rig.

Current operations[edit]
The company operates 24 drilling rigs including 19 semisubmersibles, 4 drillships, and 1 jackup rig.[4]
The company provides quarterly online updates on the status of each rig in its fleet.[5]
In 2016, Anadarko Petroleum accounted for 22.4% of the company's revenues, Petrobras accounted for 17.9% of the company's revenues, and ExxonMobil accounted for 5.8% of the company's revenues.[1]
Operations outside of the United States accounted for 66% of the company's revenues in 2016.[1]
History[edit]
Diamond Offshore's beginnings can be traced back to the earliest days of the offshore drilling industry. Its predecessor companies were ODECO, Zapata Corporation, and Diamond M Drilling Co.
Diamond Offshore’s roots date back to May 1953, when Alden J. (Doc) Laborde founded Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co. (ODECO) in New Orleans. Laborde had designed what was probably the first submersible drilling rig. After finding a financial backer in Charlie Murphy of Murphy Oil Co., a grateful Laborde built the rig in 1954 and named the unit Mr. Charlie in honor of his benefactor. Today, the Mr. Charlie is a museum and training facility in Morgan City, Louisiana.
After noticing the stability of submersible rigs when they were only partially submerged for relocation, Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built semi-submersible rig, Ocean Driller, in 1964. ODECO rigs continued to rack up “firsts” in the industry in the 1970s, with Ocean Viking discovering the giant Ekofisk oil field for Phillips Petroleum Company in the North Sea and Ocean Victory discovering the Piper oilfield and Claymore field, also in the North Sea, for Occidental Petroleum.
In the early 1960s the onshore drilling company Brewster-Bartle went bankrupt. The banks that had become the owners of the company’s rigs contacted Don McMahon to take over the failed company. McMahon accepted the challenge and formed Diamond M Drilling Co. in 1964. He named the company after Diamond M Acres, his ranch near Simonton, Texas. McMahon took his company public in 1970 and expanded into offshore waters with the building and purchase of jack-up, barge, and semi-submersible rigs. In the early 1970s, Diamond M was one of the largest owners of barge rigs in the energy industry. The company continued to drill both on land and offshore. In the late 1970s, Western Oceanic tendered an offer to buy Diamond M. Unwilling to be purchased, Diamond sought and found a “white knight” in Kaneb Services, Inc.
In 1992, Diamond M Corporation purchased all of the outstanding stock of ODECO Drilling Inc. from ODECO Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Murphy Oil. Shortly thereafter, Diamond M Corp. briefly changed its name to Diamond M-ODECO Drilling Inc. before becoming Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. in 1993. Diamond Offshore began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1995 and acquired Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd. in April 1996.[6]
Recent financial struggles[edit]
Since 2012, the company has retired or sold 12 rigs and recorded over $1.0 billion in impairment charges.[1]
On February 8, 2016, the company discontinued payment of a quarterly cash dividend.[1]
Controversies[edit]
Worker asbestos exposure[edit]
In 1989, Diamond's predecessor bought six drilling rigs from the predecessor of Kaneb Management Co. LLC. Some of Kaneb's employees continued to work for Diamond after the transaction and then sued Diamond for personal injuries they allegedly suffered from asbestos exposure while they worked for Kaneb.[7] In a 2013 filing with the SEC, Diamond acknowledged that their equipment had been used for the "manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud," but sought to be indemnified from liability.[8]

ODECO rigs continued to rack up “firsts” in the industry in the 1970s, with Ocean Viking discovering the giant Ekofisk oil field for Phillips Petroleum Company in the North Sea and Ocean Victory discovering the Piper oilfield and Claymore field, also in the North Sea, for Occidental Petroleum.
In the early 1960s the onshore drilling company Brewster-Bartle went bankrupt. The banks that had become the owners of the company’s rigs contacted Don McMahon to take over the failed company. McMahon accepted the challenge and formed Diamond M Drilling Co. in 1964. He named the company after Diamond M Acres, his ranch near Simonton, Texas. McMahon took his company public in 1970 and expanded into offshore waters with the building and purchase of jack-up, barge, and semi-submersible rigs. In the early 1970s, Diamond M was one of the largest owners of barge rigs in the energy industry. The company continued to drill both on land and offshore. In the late 1970s, Western Oceanic tendered an offer to buy Diamond M. Unwilling to be purchased, Diamond sought and found a “white knight” in Kaneb Services, Inc.
In 1992, Diamond M Corporation purchased all of the outstanding stock of ODECO Drilling Inc. from ODECO Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Murphy Oil. Shortly thereafter, Diamond M Corp. briefly changed its name to Diamond M-ODECO Drilling Inc. before becoming Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. in 1993. Diamond Offshore began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1995 and acquired Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd. in April 1996.[6]
Recent financial struggles[edit]
Since 2012, the company has retired or sold 12 rigs and recorded over $1.0 billion in impairment charges.[1]
On February 8, 2016, the company discontinued payment of a quarterly cash dividend.[1]
Controversies[edit]
Worker asbestos exposure[edit]
In 1989, Diamond's predecessor bought six drilling rigs from the predecessor of Kaneb Management Co. LLC. Some of Kaneb's employees continued to work for Diamond after the transaction and then sued Diamond for personal injuries they allegedly suffered from asbestos exposure while they worked for Kaneb.[7] In a 2013 filing with the SEC, Diamond acknowledged that their equipment had been used for the "manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud," but sought to be indemnified from liability.[8]

Current operations[edit]
The company operates 24 drilling rigs including 19 semisubmersibles, 4 drillships, and 1 jackup rig.[4]
The company provides quarterly online updates on the status of each rig in its fleet.[5]
In 2016, Anadarko Petroleum accounted for 22.4% of the company's revenues, Petrobras accounted for 17.9% of the company's revenues, and ExxonMobil accounted for 5.8% of the company's revenues.[1]
Operations outside of the United States accounted for 66% of the company's revenues in 2016.[1]
History[edit]
Diamond Offshore's beginnings can be traced back to the earliest days of the offshore drilling industry. Its predecessor companies were ODECO, Zapata Corporation, and Diamond M Drilling Co.
Diamond Offshore’s roots date back to May 1953, when Alden J. (Doc) Laborde founded Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co. (ODECO) in New Orleans. Laborde had designed what was probably the first submersible drilling rig. After finding a financial backer in Charlie Murphy of Murphy Oil Co., a grateful Laborde built the rig in 1954 and named the unit Mr. Charlie in honor of his benefactor. Today, the Mr. Charlie is a museum and training facility in Morgan City, Louisiana.
After noticing the stability of submersible rigs when they were only partially submerged for relocation, Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built semi-submersible rig, Ocean Driller, in 1964. ODECO rigs continued to rack up “firsts” in the industry in the 1970s, with Ocean Viking discovering the giant Ekofisk oil field for Phillips Petroleum Company in the North Sea and Ocean Victory discovering the Piper oilfield and Claymore field, also in the North Sea, for Occidental Petroleum.
In the early 1960s the onshore drilling company Brewster-Bartle went bankrupt. The banks that had become the owners of the company’s rigs contacted Don McMahon to take over the failed company. McMahon accepted the challenge and formed Diamond M Drilling Co. in 1964. He named the company after Diamond M Acres, his ranch near Simonton, Texas. McMahon took his company public in 1970 and expanded into offshore waters with the building and purchase of jack-up, barge, and semi-submersible rigs. In the early 1970s, Diamond M was one of the largest owners of barge rigs in the energy industry. The company continued to drill both on land and offshore. In the late 1970s, Western Oceanic tendered an offer to buy Diamond M. Unwilling to be purchased, Diamond sought and found a “white knight” in Kaneb Services, Inc.
In 1992, Diamond M Corporation purchased all of the outstanding stock of ODECO Drilling Inc. from ODECO Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Murphy Oil. Shortly thereafter, Diamond M Corp. briefly changed its name to Diamond M-ODECO Drilling Inc. before becoming Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. in 1993. Diamond Offshore began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1995 and acquired Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd. in April 1996.[6]
Recent financial struggles[edit]
Since 2012, the company has retired or sold 12 rigs and recorded over $1.0 billion in impairment charges.[1]
On February 8, 2016, the company discontinued payment of a quarterly cash dividend.[1]
Controversies[edit]
Worker asbestos exposure[edit]
In 1989, Diamond's predecessor bought six drilling rigs from the predecessor of Kaneb Management Co. LLC. Some of Kaneb's employees continued to work for Diamond after the transaction and then sued Diamond for personal injuries they allegedly suffered from asbestos exposure while they worked for Kaneb.[7] In a 2013 filing with the SEC, Diamond acknowledged that their equipment had been used for the "manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud," but sought to be indemnified from liability.[8]

Video: The Ocean Endeavor Journey
 Video: The Ocean Endeavor Completes a Well-Planned, Perfectly Executed Journey
Loading the Video...



Early in 2014 the Ocean Endeavor was scheduled to move to Romanian waters, in anticipation of planned exploration wells in the area. But before any drill bit could bite into the silty sea bottom, the rig had to go through a series of carefully planned, perfectly executed steps to get there.
The mobilization phase of the project started in mid-January 2014, and some 174 days, 2,583 nautical miles and 130,000 man-hours later, the Endeavor commenced drilling its first well.




Typically when a contract ends, Diamond Offshore will relocate a rig anywhere in the world where it is needed next. In fact, contracts in recent years had seen the massive Endeavor towed from Singapore to the Gulf of Mexico to Egypt. In relative terms, this latest trip from Egypt to nearby Romania looked to be a quick and easy jaunt. But there were two very thin, yet very formidable obstacles standing in the way. 





Two sleek bridges soar 64 meters (210 feet) high over the Bosphorus, more than enough clearance for the world's largest ships to pass safely below. But the bridge designers didn't count on a seagoing vessel with an enormous pointed tip towering 115 meters (376 feet) skyward. To get the Endeavor underneath, the derrick would have to be taken off, laid down for the passage and put back up on the other side--in effect the most challenging limbo contest Diamond Offshore has ever attempted.




Breaking the Ocean Endeavor basically in half took a lot of careful planning. The disassembly approach began with reviewing how the rig had been constructed. Knowing that the derrick was built in three sections and the cranes go up piece by piece, the Diamond Offshore engineering team basically reverse engineered it.



The Ocean Endeavor was originally designed to work in tropical environments, so all the piping was exposed. To accommodate the Black Sea environment, about five kilometers of heat tracing were installed on the rig, and certain areas with a high concentration of piping and equipment were closed off. This was not only a good economical decision, but also makes for a cleaner rig. Important consideration was also given to the rig’s crew. The Endeavor was originally equipped with numerous air conditioners, but no heaters. As a result, 75 heaters were installed in different workspaces throughout the rig along with 14 tank heaters to keep potable water, salt water and drill water from freezing. With all this new equipment on board, eight power substations had to also be installed just to run the new equipment.




The Ocean Endeavor mobilization to the Black Sea spanned over a six month period and was the first of its kind in Diamond Offshore history. This is mainly due to the size of the rig coupled with the scale of the project, including the unique challenges of crossing the Bosphorus straight. A challenging project accomplished on-time and with no recordable safety incidents.
