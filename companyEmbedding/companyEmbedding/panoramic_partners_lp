I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July. Allowing five working days it should be on hand prior to the 18th.

The quality of the toner is very good and consistent. Please work on improving the print quality towards the end of the cartridge life, after 6 months the print tends to be lighter with every print.

HomeAboutCompaniesStrategyValuesTeamAdvisorsConnect   Panorama believes that investmentsuccess in the modern private equitymarket requires a differentiated approach Panorama was founded with the mission of returning to the roots of what made private equity successful Panorama builds on its long-standing family office, family and founder led business relationships, cultivating a Keiretsu-style interconnected network of partners who share proprietary opportunities, interact with our investors with an uncommonly high level of collaboration, share exceptional co-investments, and operate with long-term business building thinking   About PanoramaPanorama targets promising companies with attractive growth characteristics and talented leadership, then we invest equity for growth and hands-on business and organizational development services IntroductionPanorama Point Partners is a private equity firm based in Omaha, NE. We operate on a Keiretsu-style model, tapping into a network built on nearly 30 years of truly unique relationships including leading family offices, businesses, foundations, and entrepreneurs worldwide. Panorama was founded on a generation of investment experience by Stephen J. George, who was previously Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Capricorn Investment Group, a $5 B private investment firm and Clarey L. Castner, the former CEO of the University of Nebraska Foundation. Our founding investment partners include:Pierce Street Capital, the investment office of the Larsen Family (founders of Milliard Refrigerated Services, one of America’s largest refrigerated logistics companies)Dr. Christoph Henkel, whose family founded Henkel AG (German DAX-30 company, $50 Billion value)Foundation founded by the Michelin Family  Our ApproachPanorama was founded with the mission of returning to the roots of what made private equity successful.  By focusing on the small capitalization end of the market, our investments are negotiated (non-auction), lower entry valuations (<6x EBITDA), and usually zero debt. Panorama's typical investment candidate has an enterprise value of less than $100 million and profits ranging $2-$15 million, framed by large addressable markets and talented managers. Depending on the situation, we invest minority or shared-control opportunities. We engage actively to help them achieve their growth plans, via organic and M&A driven strategies.Iconoclastic Location & Global NetworkOur Omaha base empowers privileged relationships with family businesses and offices and our global investor base helps us source under the radar business gems. We are backed by some of the world's top family groups, who have created market leading businesses over generations. Our culture and approach to invest in and work with our companies - as a flexible, long-term business-building partner - differentiate us from the pack.
