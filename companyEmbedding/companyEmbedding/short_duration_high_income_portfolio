Fidelity® Short Duration High Income Fund: Portfolio Manager Q&A

APRIL 30, 2017
View as PDF


Fund Managers
Matthew Conti
Matthew Bartlett

Key Takeaways



Nearly all the fund's share classes (excluding sales charges, if applicable) gained roughly 9% for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017, about in line with the Fidelity Short Duration High Income Composite IndexSM.

Portfolio Manager Matt Conti applies intensive bottom-up, fundamental credit research, with an additional goal of producing portfolio duration of less than three years.

Matt's more-conservative approach toward credit risk – which has proven a sound strategy over the longer term – held up reasonably well the past 12 months despite a risk-driven market rally led by lower-quality securities.

The fund's investments in each of three short-duration asset classes – high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds and bank loans – outperformed their respective market indexes, but high-yield bonds rallied sharply this period, and the fund trailed the 9.99% gain of its high-yield-only benchmark.

Given the rally in higher-yielding securities, an underweighting in higher-quality BB-rated high-yield bonds contributed to the fund's performance versus its benchmark.

On October 1, 2016, Matthew Bartlett became Co-Portfolio Manager of the fund, replacing Michael Plage.



Q&A


An interview with Lead Portfolio Manager Matthew Conti and Co-Portfolio Manager Matthew Bartlett

Q: Matt, how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2017?
M.C. Nearly all the fund's share classes (excluding sales charges, if applicable) gained roughly 9% the past 12 months, about in line with the Fidelity Short Duration High Income Composite IndexSM. The fund's investments in each of three short-duration asset classes – high yield bonds, investment-grade bonds and bank loans – outperformed their respective market indexes, but high-yield bonds rallied sharply this period, and the fund trailed the 9.99% return of its high-yield-only benchmark.
I'm generally pleased that my more-cautious approach toward credit risk – which has proven a sound strategy over the longer term – held up reasonably well despite a risk-driven market rally led by lower-quality bonds.
Q: Please tell us more about your strategy and how it played out the past 12 months.
M.C. In managing the fund, my mandate is to generate high income with a typical duration of three years or less. Consistent with my core high-yield investment approach, the fund remains primarily invested in high-yield bonds, which represented about 77% of fund assets the past 12 months. During the period, I pared the fund's exposure to high-yield bonds somewhat, while I increased bank debt. As of April 30, the fund's allocation to bank debt represents a significant overweighting versus our neutral weighting of 10%. Also, I maintained negligible exposure to convertible securities and equities.
Given the fund's neutral allocation of 80% to high-yield bonds, the majority of the portfolio typically represents securities rated BB and B, similar to our benchmark. At the end of the reporting period, more than 90% of the fund had a rating of BB or lower. As a result, the fund was underweighted the 10% neutral allocation to corporate investment-grade, short-duration securities.
In managing the fund, I apply intensive bottom-up, fundamental credit research, with an additional goal of producing portfolio duration of less than three years. Liquidity analysis is a unique factor I consider, since many bonds will be held until they are called or mature. Mitigating default risk is important to keep the fund's steady income flow as maturities approach.
I invest in companies that I believe are likely to reduce their debt, and that I think can withstand challenges, such as a bad quarter, an economic dip, a secular headwind or increased competition. I place great emphasis on free cash flow, which, in my opinion, is the only means by which companies can organically improve their balance sheets.
I look for companies that not only generate free cash flow, but also plan to use it to reduce debt. A firm not generating enough cash to meet its obligations needs to issue more debt, in turn eroding its creditworthiness. I focus on bonds with reliable income, and the select few backed by companies that I consider worthy of eventually receiving a credit-rating upgrade.
Q: Turning to you, Matthew. How did your investment-grade bond subportfolio fare?
M.B. The fund typically holds about 10% of its assets in investment-grade bonds. The past year, however, the fund had an allocation of 8%, on average. As Matt noted, this allocation posted a positive absolute result, but nonetheless dampened results versus the benchmark because higher-yielding assets were much stronger.
Compared with the rest of the portfolio, the investment-grade allocation should help dampen volatility while, over time, providing the opportunity for excess return through security selection. I manage the subportfolio using the same process I employ in managing other Fidelity investment-grade bond funds. Capitalizing on our world-class team of analysts and traders, I identify issuers offering stable-to-improving credit metrics with bonds trading at what we believe are attractive valuations.
Q: Back to you, Matt. What factors at a sector/industry level had the biggest influence on the fund's relative performance?
M.C. Positive security selection overall, led by energy and gaming, aided the fund's performance versus its benchmark. Favorable positioning in telecom provided a further boost versus the benchmark.
Among our core high-yield investments, a sizable underweighting in metals/mining – one of the top-performing groups this period – was the biggest negative. I underweighted metals/mining because I thought other parts of the market offered opportunities that better fit my strategy.
Q: You noted that you increased the fund's allocation to bank loans...
M.C. Yes, I increased our bank-loan allocation from 12% of the portfolio at the beginning of the period to about 15% by April 30 on the view that they offered better relative value than investment-grade debt this period. Moreover, another element of my strategy is to try to protect the portfolio against rising interest rates. Bank loans typically benefit from rising rates because their stated interest rates adjust higher as market interest rates move up. With policy rates at record-low levels, this added rate protection is aligned with the fund's charter.
Q: Which individual investments had the greatest impact on relative performance?
M.C. Chesapeake Energy proved to be a productive holding. It made substantial progress improving its balance sheet after posting several consecutive quarters of lower per-unit operating expenses. Industry fundamentals were in the firm's favor, as projected demand for natural gas outstripped supply, boosting prices.
In health care, our caution proved advantageous with hospital operator HCA, which we underweighted, as the ultimate fate of the Affordable Care Act weighed on its bonds the past 12 months.
Not owning copper miner and index component First Quantum Minerals until late in the period proved a mistake, as the bonds rallied amid a rebound in copper prices.
Lastly, our large holding in American Airlines lagged because rising fuel prices nicked cash flow and industry sentiment turned negative. I still believe the credit is solid and industry conditions are supportive for rational capacity growth and steady cash flows.
Q: What's your outlook as of April 30, Matt?
M.C. As we enter the later phase of this economic cycle, I believe short-duration, high-yield corporate bonds are well-positioned. With strong liquidity at the corporate level, shorter-duration securities can not only reduce interest rate risk, but can also minimize credit risk, given their priority in being paid off by issuers.
The next stage of the high-yield market environment could lean favorably into my long-term strategy. Less correlation means company-specific factors should become more dominant in determining high-yield bond prices. Given my research-driven security-selection process, the inherent structure of the fund should be positioned to provide reliable income with relatively low volatility. ■





Matt Conti on high-yield bonds in a low-volatility environment:


"VIX, also known colloquially as the 'fear gauge,' is a key measure of market volatility. VIX is the ticker symbol for the Chicago Board of Options (CBOE) Volatility Index. The VIX is constructed using the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500® index options. It is a key indicator of the level of volatility expected in the stock market over the next 30 days. And stock market volatility is normally seen as a proxy for other risk assets, such as high-yield bonds.
"During the 12-month reporting period, the VIX trended lower, and on May 1, 2017, closed at 10.11, its lowest level in more than 10 years. This movement lower in the VIX coincided with a continuation of strong performance for high-yield bonds.
"Historically, a low VIX level has been correlated with periods of relatively rich valuations for high-yield bonds. This is partly explained by investor complacency as the values of risk securities become increasingly elevated. Indeed, as of period end, the valuation of the high-yield market, as measured by the yield advantage offered by the asset class versus U.S. Treasuries, could be characterized as rich or full.
"Does a fully valued high-yield market mean that a correction is just around the corner? Not necessarily. History has shown that relatively tight spreads and low volatility can persist for extended periods of time. So, while I believe a low VIX implies that a cautious approach to market risk may be prudent, it does not necessarily signal an imminent change in market performance."




MARKET RECAP


Fueled by a resurgence in investor risk appetite, U.S. corporate high-yield bonds gained 13.65% for the year ending April 30, 2017, as measured by The BofA Merrill LynchSM US High Yield Constrained Index. Early on, high yield benefited from a revival in oil markets and strengthening macro tailwinds. Following a brief, late-June disruption related to Britain's vote to exit the European Union (Brexit), high yield resumed its rally through the end of October. The asset class suffered a slight downturn in November – its first negative month since January 2016 – as interest rates spiked following the U.S. elections and oil prices were volatile due to uncertainty about production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). However, the energy-heavy index strengthened by month end amid optimism following OPEC's first production cut since 2008. The rally continued through February, aided by investor optimism despite few specifics on the new administration's plans, but retreated a bit in March before resuming the uptrend. Reflecting a more favorable environment for riskier assets, lower-quality bonds within the index fared best. Gains were broad-based across industries, with energy, steel and metals/mining leading the way amid firming commodities prices. Laggards included the more defensive health care and food/beverage/tobacco categories.

                The ratings are by Standard & Poor's except where otherwise indicated. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations except for those debt obligations that are only privately rated. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Investment grade is defined as those issuers that have a long-term credit rating of BBB- or higher. "NR" indicates no rating. The credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities in the Fund, and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings are subject to change.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


5
The unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield is calculated the same as the 30-day SEC yield, however it excludes contractual fee waivers and expense reimbursements.


6
Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the fund's most recent ordinary distribution paid or declared, on an annualized basis, by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.


7
A measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield. It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements. Senior loans have an effective duration close to zero. For purposes of calculating an effective duration for senior loans, a duration of 0.25 is assumed.


8
The annualized return that would be earned on a debt security if held to maturity, weighted by the value of each debt security in the fund's portfolio.  The calculation does not include the effect of fund fees and expenses.


9
The average number of days until the floating component of a loan resets.


10
A short-term funding rate estimated by banks in London that they would be charged if borrowing from other banks assuming a three month maturity.


11
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.


12
Inception Date is 11/1/2012









You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.






The Fund is subject to the following risks:


    You could lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment
    objectives. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.



        BANK LOANS RISK.
     An investment in bank loans subjects the Fund to credit risk, which is heightened for bank loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy. Senior floating rate loans, in which the Fund may invest, are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. As a result, the risks associated with these senior floating rate loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior floating rate loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior floating rate loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior floating rate loan's value. Unlike the securities markets, there is no central clearinghouse for loan trades, and the loan market has not established enforceable settlement standards or remedies for failure to settle. Therefore, portfolio transactions in senior floating rate loan may have uncertain settlement time periods. Senior floating rate loans are subject to a number of risks described elsewhere in this prospectus, including liquidity risk and the risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income instruments. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in greater volatility of senior floating rate loans and average duration may fluctuate with fluctuations in interest rates.



        CALL RISK.
     If an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the Fund, performance could be adversely impacted.


CONVERTIBLE BONDS RISK.
    The market values of convertible bonds tend to decline as interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline. A convertible bond's market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company.


CREDIT RISK. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security may be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability or willingness to make such payments. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of its net assets in high yield or "junk" debt. Such securities, while generally offering higher yields than investment grade debt with similar maturities, involve greater risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.


CURRENCY RISK. Because the Fund's net asset value is determined on the basis of U.S. dollars and the Fund invests in non-U.S. dollar denominated securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of the Fund's holdings goes up. The Fund may hedge certain of its non-U.S. dollar holdings.


CYBER SECURITY RISK. As the use of Internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business, the Fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security. A breach in cyber security refers to both intentional and unintentional events that may cause the Fund to lose proprietary information, suffer data corruption or lose operational capacity. Such events could cause the Fund to incur regulatory penalties, reputational damage, additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures and/or financial loss. Cyber security breaches may involve unauthorized access to the Fund's digital information systems through "hacking" or malicious software coding, but may also result from outside attacks such as denial-of-service attacks through efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users. In addition, cyber security breaches of the Fund's third party service providers, such as its administrator, transfer agent, custodian, or sub-advisor, as applicable, or issuers in which the Fund invests, can also subject the Fund to many of the same risks associated with direct cyber security breaches. The Fund has established risk management systems designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security. However, there is no guarantee that such efforts will succeed, especially because the Fund does not directly control the cyber security systems of issuers or third party service providers.


HIGH YIELD SECURITIES RISK. High yield securities, or "junk" bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, are considered to be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. If the economy slows down or dips into recession, the issuers of high yield securities may not have sufficient resources to continue making timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. The market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities. High yield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due to the smaller, less liquid market for high yield securities, the bid-offer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete. In general, high yield securities may have a greater risk of default than other types of securities.


ILLIQUID SECURITIES RISK. Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the Fund or at prices approximately the value at which the Fund is carrying the securities on its books.



        INCOME RISK. If interest rates fall, the income from the Fund's portfolio will likely decline if the Fund holds floating rate debt that will adjust lower with falling interest rates. For loans, interest rates typically reset periodically.


INTEREST RATE RISK. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the debt securities in the Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Interest rate risk is generally lower for shorter-term investments and higher for longer-term investments. Duration is a measure of the expected price volatility of a debt instrument as a result of changes in market rates of interest, based on, among other factors, the weighted average timing of the instrument's expected principal and interest payments. In general, duration represents the expected percentage change in the value of a security for an immediate 1% change in interest rates. Therefore, prices of debt securities with shorter durations tend to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than debt securities with longer durations. As the value of a debt security changes over time, so will its duration.


LIQUIDITY RISK. The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. If the economy experiences a sudden downturn, or if the debt markets for such companies become distressed, the Fund may have particular difficulty selling its assets in sufficient amounts, at reasonable prices and in a sufficiently timely manner to raise the cash necessary to meet any potentially heavy redemption requests by Fund shareholders.


MANAGEMENT RISK. The Fund is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio. The portfolio managers will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.


MARKET RISK. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the Fund or shares of the Fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of the Fund could decline in value or underperform other investments.


NON-U.S. SECURITIES RISK. Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political, social or economic developments, restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities, lack of liquidity, currency exchange rates, excessive taxation, government seizure of assets, different legal or accounting standards, and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries.


OTHER DEBT SECURITIES RISK. Secured loans that are not first lien loans, unsecured loans and other debt securities are subject to many of the same risks that affect Senior Loans; however they are often unsecured and/or lower in the issuer's capital structure than Senior Loans, and thus may be exposed to greater risk of default and lower recoveries in the event of a default. This risk can be further heightened in the case of below investment grade instruments. Additionally, most fixed income securities are fixed-rate and thus are generally more susceptible than floating rate loans to price volatility related to changes in prevailing interest rates.


PREPAYMENT RISK. Loans and other fixed income investments are subject to prepayment risk. The degree to which borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

                Short-Duration High Income





Investment Objective

			The strategy seeks to generate high current income with a focus on total return, while at the same time seeking to maintain a low sensitivity to rising interest rates. Additionally, the strategy further seeks lower-level volatility than the broader high-yield market.
		


Investment Style

			Construct a diversified portfolio of high income short duration investments including high yield bonds, leveraged loans, middle market debt, emerging market credit and Non-Agency RMBS. Investments are primarily in issues with maturities of less than 7 years with the resulting portfolio duration being less than 3 years. Western expects to utilize issue selection, sector rotation, ratings positioning and industry allocation as active strategies to generate superior risk adjusted returns.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 590 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
590
 funds
                     	




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to generate a high level of current income.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in fixed income securities and loans issued by companies that are rated below investment grade. It generally invests in high yield instruments rated CCC or better by S&P or Moody's. The fixed income securities and loans in which the manager expects to invest include traditional corporate bonds, U.S. government obligations and bank loans to corporate borrowers, and may have fixed, floating or variable rates.


Risk



The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because Morningstar has rated its risk below the 20th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 4/6/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Fixed-income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities falls. High yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Leverage may increase volatility and possibility of loss.  Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks. 












FUND FACTS 


Income Focused
Strategic investments across higher-yielding, lower-duration sectors 

Diversification
Minimum 80% allocation to high yield bonds and bank loans, including middle market debt; up to 20% allocated to other income sectors, i.e., investment grade, EM debt and structured products

Duration Management

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate, and investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 2.25%. Class C1 shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been waived in various periods.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.


Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, C, I & R reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.  For Class(es) C1, there are currently no fee waivers in effect, so gross and net expenses are identical.

 Characteristics

Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). For this purpose, if two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the lowest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

The Fund
The Fund provides exposure to the shorter duration segment of the high-yield bond market, investing primarily in investments with an expected duration profile of three years or less. Managed for total return, the Fund seeks a combination of both current  income and capital appreciation potential. Managed by Eaton Vance, one of America’s most experienced high-yield bond managers.



The Approach
Fundamental bottom-up credit research and top-down market analysis are the cornerstones of the Fund’s approach. Invests broadly across the shorter duration high-yield bond universe, providing exposure to the high-yield market’s many sectors,  credit tiers and issuers. A focus on research and lower duration may help provide lower overall risk than other high-yield bond strategies.



The Features
The Fund’s investments in shorter duration high-yield bonds and floating-rate loans may help provide investor portfolios’ a level of protection in a rising-rate environment, as investments in the Fund’s universe have typically performed  with low correlation to traditional bond markets. Access to a leader in high-yield bond investment management and a well-defined investment process that has been in place for over 20 years.







 

 OverviewShort-Duration High Yield investments have historically provided strong returns during periods of rising rates, compared to other fixed-income asset classes. Additionally, Eaton Vance has had strong risk-adjusted returns since fund inception.1

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of the class reflects returns of the Short Duration High Income Portfolio, the separate registered investment company in which  the Fund invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. Max Sales Charge: 2.25%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Portfolio Management




 
Michael W. Weilheimer, CFA


Managed Fund since inception






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should revi ew the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected  by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and i nterest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments  is likely to decline. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risk s of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in t he return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should revi ew the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Cash Pay BB-B 1-3 Year Index is an unmanaged index of U.S. corporate bonds currently paying a coupon, rated BB1 through B3, and having a maturity less than 3 years. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect  the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or futur e performance of the fund.

5. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 2/28/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
7. The Morningstar High Yield Bond Category includes funds that invest in lower-quality bonds with typically 65% or more in bonds not rated or rated BB or below by one of the major ratings agencies.
8. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
9. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Credit ratings are categorized using S&P. If S&P does not publish a rating, then the Moody's rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not to the Fund or its sha res. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's)  are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condi tion and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the national ratings agencies stated above.
