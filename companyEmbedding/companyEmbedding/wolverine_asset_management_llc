You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

CHICAGO and NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Wolverine Asset Management, LLC ("WAM"), the manager for Wolverine Flagship Fund Trading Limited, a multi-strategy private investment fund with approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, and one of the largest shareholders of JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:   JMI) ("JAVELIN" or the "Company") with beneficial ownership of approximately 5.1% of the Company's outstanding shares, today announced that it has sent a letter to the JAVELIN Board of Directors (the "Board"), the full text of which is below.  
WAM also announced today that it has nominated six highly qualified candidates – Steve Joung, Eric W. Muehlhauser, Olof S. Nelson, Norman J. Rice, III, Donald J. Tringali, and John D. Ziegelman – for election to the JAVELIN Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  
The full text of the letter follows:
December 15, 2015
Board of Directors
JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp.
3001 Ocean Drive, Suite 201
Vero Beach, FL 32963
Dear Members of the Board,
Wolverine Asset Management, LLC ("WAM") is the manager for Wolverine Flagship Fund Trading Limited ("WFF"), a multi-strategy private investment fund with approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management.  As of the close of business on December 14, 2015, WFF has a beneficial ownership interest1 in approximately 5.1% of the outstanding shares2 of JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp. ("JMI" or the "Company").
We appreciate the dialogue we have had with management and the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") over the past seven months, and we are pleased at yesterday morning's attempts to correct a fraction of the Company's substantial problems. Regrettably, we note two items that detract from your presumed shareholder-friendly actions. First and foremost, it was not until our discussions reached the point of our threatening to nominate a competing slate for the Board that any tangible response to our concerns occurred. Second, yesterday's market response shows clear skepticism over the adequacy of your plan for restoring lost shareholder value and curing the problematic status quo that exists at JMI. 
Today, we have delivered to the Company a formal notice of our nomination of a slate of six (6) highly qualified director candidates for election to the Board at JMI's 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2016 Annual Meeting").  We have taken this step because we have grown increasingly concerned with the direction of the Company under current leadership. Specifically, we hold the view that management cannot deliver value through continued operations based on the foregoing: i) a consistent record of underperformance,  ii) a fee structure that is in direct conflict with shareholder interests, despite amendments announced in yesterday's press release, and (iii) conflicts of interest within management and the current Board. Given the small size of the Company and limited set of options, our analysis suggests the best value-enhancing outcome for shareholders at this point would be to liquidate the portfolio and distribute the proceeds to shareholders.  Our director candidates are committed to considering any actions that would lead to shareholder value maximization, up to and including full liquidation.
Consistent Record of Underperformance
The latest quarterly results show that JMI's book value has dropped by 51% since the October 2012 IPO.  Total return on book value has been -22% over the same period.   This compares to an average total return of +20% for its peer group3.  A 42% underperformance is astonishingly disappointing given the similarity of assets. Furthermore, this underperformance has been consistent, as JMI has underperformed its peer group average in 10 out of 12 quarters, and based on the Company's recent disclosures and our estimates, yet again in the current quarter. Our expectation would be that an asset management contract is terminated or investor capital fully redeemed on the back of such dismal performance.  Investors have an entrenched Board and shareholder-unfriendly structure to thank for ARMOUR Capital Management LP's ("ACM") continued role in (mis)managing the JMI portfolio.

The story is worse for JMI's share price: the stock has dropped 72%, from $20 at IPO to $5.56 as of 12/14/15. Adding back dividends results in a total return to shareholders of -42% in the three years since IPO, compared to a +1% average for the peer group over that same period.

Fee Structure that is in Direct Conflict with Shareholder Interests
In this period of dramatic underperformance, management has reaped a windfall.  Management fees have become excessive as a percentage of shareholder equity.  The management fee is calculated as 1.5% of gross issuance proceeds (net of share buybacks), which effectively means the manager receives a constant dollar amount regardless of performance.  This structure runs counter to shareholder interests in two ways: i) if the book value declines from losses, the effective fee as a percentage of shareholder equity rises, and ii) there is a disincentive for management to repurchase shares, as it reduces the management fee.  The 51% drop in book value since IPO has resulted in the 1.5% fee ballooning to 3.1% of current book value, making JMI's the highest management fee in the sector, as a direct result of having the worst performance. 
Administrative expenses have also increased as a percentage of the declining equity, since many of the costs are fixed.  Using the average of the previous four quarters' expenses and most recent quarterly book value, the current administrative expense rate is 2.7% per year.  Combining this with the 3.1% management fee results in an untenable total fee and expense burden of 5.8%, creating an additional 240 basis points of drag on investor returns relative to the peer group average of 3.4%. 
We held discussions with the management team in May 2015 in which we specifically highlighted our concerns about the fees and expenses. While seven months should have been ample time to implement a fee structure less deviant from industry norms, it was only after an investor filled out an approximately 240-page nomination package that the Board was spurred to action. Optically, your agreed-upon management fee rebate to 1.5% of Total Stockholders' Equity trims JMI's untenable fee structure toward your peer average. Yet the fee rebate is subject to retraction at the sole discretion of ACM without any input from the Board. Additionally, it is structured as a rebate rather than a top-line reduction, which means that the egregious termination fee for ACM would remain unchanged at an astonishing 9.3% of book value. The fact that such a change was only made once WAM's intention to nominate a full slate became clear makes us skeptical that any part of these supposed shareholder-friendly actions will remain in place without continued, exhaustive pressure from one or more large shareholders. The reduction in Board member expenses is similarly discretionary and equally easy to repeal once shareholder pressure eases. 
Conflicts of Interest within Management and the Current Board
We are also highly concerned with conflicts of interest among the Board as well as the manager.  The four non-independent directors on the Board each has an economic participation in the management fees through partnership in the external manager, and thus a strong incentive to vote against share repurchases or any other action that might reduce the size of the fee-paying asset base.  Additionally, ACM's agreement for managing the much larger (and higher fee-paying) portfolio of ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. raises the question of time allocation, attention and focus on JMI.
JMI shares currently trade at around 58% of book value, based on recent Company disclosures and share price on 12/14/154.  At such a deep discount, every share bought at $5.56, when combined with $9.79 in net asset sales, results in a $4.23 gain on book value, or a 76% return on invested capital.  This type of instantaneous return vastly outweighs any expected returns from investing in MBS at full value.
We have met and spoken with JMI's co-CEO's, who are also Board members, several times since May 2015.  In each instance we voiced our concerns over the poor performance, significant discount to book value, and the need to take action that would create value for shareholders.  We expressed our desire for significant share repurchases and a rationalization of fees and expenses to a sustainable level.  After a wholly inadequate 0.7% of outstanding shares were repurchased in mid-2015, there have been none in the past five months.  Performance has continued to deteriorate, and shares have continued to trade at 58-65% of book value.  Management has repeatedly stated on earnings calls and in direct conversations that they do not intend to repurchase shares due to concerns about repo counterparty relationships and operational scale.  
The only thing to date that has remedied this intransigent behavior has been the threat of our severe step of nominating a competing slate to assume control of the Board. The December 14 announcement of an expansion in the share repurchase program, if it is actually executed, is a stunning reversal from Company comments just a few short weeks ago. If the Company failed to exercise this option when it was authorized to repurchase up to 1.4 million shares, how can investors expect different behavior just because the Board increased the repurchase program to 2.0 million shares? It is hard for any investor to believe that either management or the Board is truly considering his or her best interests if any suggestion not attached to a proxy is met with calculated dismissal.
Liquidation and Recovery
While share repurchases at the current discount to book value creates exceptional value for shareholders, the concerns about size and scale are not without merit.  Shrinking the company further would also exacerbate the problem with administrative expenses.  However, to continue on the current path will likely lead to further book value erosion and sub-par performance, which would likely result in an even greater share price discount, resulting in a downward spiral for shareholders.  Due to its small scale, the Company must be willing to consider all alternatives, including a full liquidation of the Company if that is the only credible path towards maximizing shareholder value.  Unfortunately, the Board's direct economic interest in maintaining the status quo has led to an unwillingness to even consider this or other value-enhancing options.
For example, liquidation would result in recovery of approximately 87-89% of book value for shareholders, after factoring in the excessive management termination fee (9%) as well as execution and administrative costs (2-4%).  In our recent discussions, management noted a similar estimate of 86%. Using the most recent company updated book value estimate of $9.79, our estimate would result in liquidation proceeds of $8.52-8.71 per share.  This would provide shareholders a 53-57% gain over the recent share price of $5.56.
Management has repeatedly stated that the overall portfolio is small enough that shrinking it further would cause the Company to become irrelevant to its counterparties. We agree with that assessment. Fortunately for JMI investors, the small size of the portfolio mitigates the concern that trades taken to unwind the portfolio might be large or awkward enough to have an outsized secondary market impact.
The current situation is unsustainable. Without further and more drastic action, the market will continue to price JMI shares at a substantial discount to its potential value under alternative approaches. Nominating a slate of director candidates is an extraordinary step for us, but we cannot allow the value-destructive status quo to persist.  We remain prepared to continue our dialogue, however, if we cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution, we are fully prepared to solicit the support of our fellow shareholders to elect six new Board members who are committed to representing the best interests of all JMI shareholders.

Wolverine Asset Management – Best Convertible Arbitrage Manager

Articles and Features











Wolverine Asset Management is a US-based alternative asset management firm and part of the Wolverine family of companies, a diversified group of affiliated financial service entities primarily engaged in asset management, derivatives trading, order routing and technology/software development.
Founded in 1994, Wolverine is headquartered in Chicago and has offices in San Francisco, New York and London, employing more than 300 people. The firm places great emphasis on technology and infrastructure, and invests heavily in these areas to trade derivative securities across a number of global exchanges.
Wolverine Asset Management itself was established in 2001 and combines this world-class execution technology with quantitative modelling, research, risk management and trading expertise to seek attractive risk-adjusted returns for its investors.
The Wolverine Convertible Arbitrage Fund is the firm’s flagship offering and uses a relative value approach based on WAM’s proficiency in volatility trading.
Chief investment officer Christopher Gust, who has more than 20 years’ investment experience, leads the WAM team and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the firm and its investment activities. He heads the firm’s investment committee and is also co-founder of Wolverine Trading, where he has been the driving force behind its successful growth.
Commenting on market conditions over the past 12 months, Gust describes the convertible arbitrage space as “mixed, but fruitful”, noting that a continuation of the credit tightening theme has also brought a tightening of implied volatilities across the board.
“Success in 2010 required prowess in the specific selection of securities, as a greater percentage of the convertible universe moved from more credit-sensitive to more equity-sensitive,” he says, adding that managers who were able to hedge implied volatilities probably had an edge in performance.
The Wolverine Convertible Arbitrage Fund employs various strategies to supplement the capital structure strategy that represents two-thirds of the fund’s risk. The firm’s portfolio managers use a proprietary screening process when looking for mispriced securities to value layers of a firm’s capital structure. The portfolio is then hedged through a combination of listed equities options and futures.
Other strategies traded within the fund include fundamental equity market neutral, risk arbitrage and various volatility-based strategies. With respect to risk management, WAM’s goal is to achieve consistent returns while minimising idiosyncratic risks through diversification.
Gust attributes last year’s success to the disciplined repeatable process utilised by the investment team both in security selection and in the unique way it hedges the portfolio.
“Security rotation and the ability to generate revenues from trading continue to be the key challenges in 2011,” he says.
Wolverine partners and employees are the largest investors in the Convertible Arbitrage Fund, owning more than 20 per cent of its assets. The fund currently has more than USD1.4bn in assets under management. The fund has returned over 12 per cent compounded annually since 2005.
Gust says of winning the Hedgeweek USA Award 2011 for Best Convertible Arbitrage Manager: “The team at Wolverine is happy to be recognised, not only for its investment results, but also for its discipline in achieving those results. We strive to manage our portfolio in a conservative manner, continually attempting to hedge extreme risks whatever the market conditions. This award is an affirmation of the quality of our investment team, organisation and infrastructure.”

Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

Emerging Markets at the Crossroads
A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past. Increasingly, discovering EM investment opportunities will be rooted in the ability to capture the alpha from the new growth drivers, rather than in chasing the beta of the broad EM universe.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
