BT partners with Rubicon Project

        09 May 2017                     | 
            David Pidgeon 
                                            
 
 
 
 
 





Adtech firm Rubicon Project has been selected by BT to boost the broadcaster and internet provider's digital ad proposition.
BT's online advertising wing will use Rubicon Project's exchange to connect advertisers to its ten million users across BT.com, BT Sport.com and the BT Sport and BT Wi-Fi apps. 
Under the agreement, BT will use Rubicon Project’s technology to internally manage its programmatic sales across mobile in-app, mobile web, video and desktop inventory in open and private marketplace environments. 
Ad2One, the digital sales house, will continue to sell BT’s guaranteed inventory.
"We are expanding our digital advertising team and looking to work with new partners who can help us provide great performance for our buyers and drive incremental growth to our expanding digital assets," said Stuart Keith, head of digital advertising sales at BT.
"As we continue to develop and invest in digital advertising, we are confident Rubicon Project is the right choice for BT as the next platform to partner with."
Rubicon Project recently made headlines when the Guardian announced that it was suing the firm six months after the publisher revealed it was losing as much as 70 pence in every pound to adtech middlemen.
Earlier this year the publisher confirmed it is preparing to sue Rubicon Project "for the recovery of non-disclosed buyer fees in relation of Guardian inventory."
Rubicon Project said it disputes the allegation, stating that it charges buyer fees for certain services and that it disclosed that fact both publicly and in the contract it signed with the Guardian over a year ago.
"We split our fees between sellers and buyers, reflecting the value we provide to both," Rubicon said in March.

Atmel Launches IoT Cloud Ecosystem Partner Program,  Accelerating Internet of Things Development 
Atmel Launches IoT Cloud Ecosystem Partner Program,  Accelerating Internet of Things Development 
Offering End-to-End Solution, Cloud Ecosystem Program Accelerates Time-to-Market for Developers Creating Next-Generation Smart, Secure and Connected IoT Solutions on Atmel Devices

SAN JOSE, CA, July 13, 2015 – Atmel® Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in microcontroller (MCU) and touch solutions, today launched the Atmel Internet of Things (IoT) Cloud Ecosystem Partner Program. The new program enables developers using Atmel | SMART MCUs and Atmel SmartConnect wireless solutions to access Atmel’s market-leading ecosystem cloud partners for device management, data analytics, and visualization in order to experience an end-to-end IoT solution development ‘out of the box’.
With the increasing need to collect, visualize and analyze data from IoT edge nodes and to manage the associated services, cloud connectivity is becoming an essential element for product development. Device management is also an important aspect of cloud services as more devices are performing functions through remote management, such as a connected thermostat that is programmed remotely and sends climate information back to the user’s remote device reducing overall power consumption while providing a better user experience.
Each cloud partner in this program not only brings a unique, distinct feature to the IoT ecosystem for developers using Atmel solutions but also offers production-ready software stacks ported on Atmel wireless platforms to help accelerate time-to-market. Developers can now easily connect to the cloud through various software as a service (SaaS) options, based on their use-case requirements early in the development cycle. Additionally, Atmel is in the process of onboarding multiple cloud service partners providing regional and vertical expertise where required.
"As a leading provider of IoT solutions, our goal is to provide a seamless end-to-end solution for our developers," said Reza Kazerounian, SVP and GM of Microcontroller Business Unit, Atmel Corporation. "Launching this highly anticipated IoT ecosystem partner program, we are now one of the few suppliers that delivers solutions from the edge node to the cloud, along with full software support. We are excited to team with these unique cloud service companies and look forward to adding many more."
With the anticipated growth of billions of devices by 2020 in the IoT market, secure, cloud services will be a critical element to ensure Internet accessibility connectivity of these smart devices. The partner program ensures developers have the opportunity to design with Atmel’s pre-certified Wi-Fi, 802.15.4, and multimode modules and Atmel | SMART MCUs to provide a seamless end-to-end solution from the edge node to the cloud with a simple, plug-and-play connection that works out of the box. IoT developers can simply use any of the compatible Atmel development boards for access to the application programming interface (API) to qualified cloud partners.
Development Kits
To accelerate a design, several development kits are available with access to Atmel Cloud Partners including the WINC1500-XSTK, SAMW25-XPRO, SAMR21-XPRO and the Arduino Zero.  All Atmel boards are fully compatible with the latest version of Atmel Studio integrated development platform. 
Quotes from Cloud Ecosystem Partners 
Arrayent 
"We are thrilled to partner with a leading IoT solutions provider such as Atmel," said Cyril Brignone, CEO, Arrayent. "Trusted brands worldwide have gone to market at consumer scale using our IoT cloud service platform. Our partnership with Atmel, based on a small footprint embedded library combined with a scalable cloud service, offers our joint customers a proven, secure, and ready-to-go IoT solution."
Exosite 
"We are proud to announce that our Exosite Ready™ commercial-grade embedded code is accessible on qualified Atmel products," said Hans Rempel, CEO, Exosite. "With Atmel’s free IoT developer site powered by Exosite, enterprises adopting Atmel products now have access to Exosite's enterprise IoT application platform that is built to maximize security at the earliest stages of development. We are excited to collaborate with one of the leading IoT companies in the embedded space to help enterprises bring their next-generation connected products to market faster and with significantly less investment and risk."
Proximetry
"Our cloud services are integrated into several leading Atmel | SMART MCUs, SmartConnect and security modules," said Tracy Trent, CEO, Proximetry. "We provide leading software solutions that enable the management of the most critical of things in the IoT including remote access and secure data management. With our services integrated into Atmel’s leading products, IoT developers now have a true end-to-end solution from the edge node to the cloud."
PubNub 
"We are excited to team with Atmel to deliver to their customers a highly secure solution for bi-directional device communication and control,” said Todd Greene, CEO of PubNub. "Our highly reliable and massively scalable Data Stream Network provides companies with real-time infrastructure and a robust feature set for architecting their IoT solutions. Our partnership with Atmel offers the only ‘out of the box’ solution for IoT developers to create secure IoT products, reducing risk and accelerating time-to-market."
