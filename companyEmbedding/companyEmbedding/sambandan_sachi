Zambrano, Pallie 

Pallie Zambrano J.D. ’99 has been honored by the YWCA of Silicon Valley with a 2013 Tribute to Women and Industry (TWIN) Award, one of the most prestigious awards given by local and regional YWCAs nationwide. Zambrano is a partner at McManis Faulkner, a leading Northern California trial firm.
The TWIN Award program was established in 1984 to honor the outstanding achievements of female executives who have demonstrated excellence in business leadership positions and to pay tribute to the companies in which they work. Zambrano joins a group of honorees selected from Silicon Valley technology, legal, communications, nonprofit, and healthcare organizations that have acted as successful role models for other women in business, exhibited top-level responsibility in a major functional role, and who have had a substantial impact on the organization’s growth, profitability and innovation.
Zambrano represents families in all aspects of marital dissolutions, including custody and visitation, asset valuation and misappropriation, assessment of support, tracing of separate property reimbursement claims, and validity testing of pre-nuptial agreements. She has earned a reputation for delivering successful outcomes to all parties involved, even in the most sensitive matters. Zambrano also navigates complex situations involving family law issues in tandem with business litigation, criminal defense and/or general civil litigation matters.
 
Zambrano is the president of the Bay Area chapter of The Pajama Program, a nonprofit group that collects new books and pajamas for children in need. She also serves on the boards for the Santa Clara County La Raza Lawyers Association and the La Raza Lawyers Charitable Foundation.
