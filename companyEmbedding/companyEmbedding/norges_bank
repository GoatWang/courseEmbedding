Latest update of the list: 29 June 2017

The notes ... are the product of highly advanced graphic design that will function as a secure and effective means of payment for many years to come," Governor Øystein Olsen said.Enhanced SecurityThe public should familiarise themselves with the security features on the new banknotes."Security and confidence in cash as a means of payment are the main reasons why we are now launching new banknotes. The general public needs to be confident that a 100-krone note is actually worth its face value. At the same time, the authenticity of the banknotes must be easy to verify," Trond Eklund, the project manager for the new banknote series, said.The general public should note two new security features. In the lower-left corner of the front side of the new notes there is a ring. When you tilt the banknote in different directions, the ring appears to float and you can see a play of colors. When you tilt the note back and forth, the chain on the right-hand side of the banknote appears to move.As with previous series, watermarks and security threads are also featured in the new banknote series.Old Banknotes to Circulate Until 2018The old 100-krone and 200-krone banknotes will circulate in parallel with the new banknotes for a period and will remain legal tender until May 30, 2018. After this period, Norges Bank is obliged to exchange these notes for at least 10 more years."We encourage the general public to either spend their old banknotes or deposit them in a bank account well ahead of 30 May 2018," Mr. Eklund said.The motifs on all of the new banknote series denominations show the importance of the sea for the prosperity and welfare of the people of Norway. The primary motif on the front side of the 100-krone banknote is a Viking ship, while on the 200-krone note, a cod is portrayed facing left. On the back sides, abstract representations of a cargo ship (100-krone note) and a fishing boat (200-krone note) can be seen on the horizon.The banknotes were designed by Norges Bank's banknote designers Arild Yttri and Morten Johansen. The designs on the front sides of the banknotes are based on the proposal from Metric Design and Terje Tønnessen. The proposals for the back of the notes were submitted by Snøhetta Design. The primary motifs were drawn by the artist Sverre Morken. The Atlantic puffin watermark motif is based on a photo taken by photographer Tom Schandy.The new 100-krone and 200-krone banknotes were printed by Oberthur Fiduciare in France.Launch in LofotenThe official launch of the new banknotes took place in Svolvær on May 30 at 2.00 p.m. From that time, the new 100- and 200-krone banknotes will be made available to banks at Norges Bank's central bank depots in Tromsø, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Oslo."There are very few places that reflect the primary motifs of the 100-krone and 200-krone bank notes better than Lofoten. Abundant cod from the Lofoten fisheries has sustained people in Norway and abroad for centuries, and Lofoten has a history as a seat of power in the Viking Age. We are therefore delighted that the launch of the new banknotes will be marked in Lofoten," Governor Olsen said.The 50-krone and 500-krone banknotes in the new banknote series will be issued in autumn 2018, while the 1,000-krone banknote will be issued in 2019. World Banknotes Currently Available on eBay   Pic Title Details  WORLD BANKNOTES SCARCE LOT OF 50+PS.

The investments in government bonds are distributed according to the economic size of a country, as measured by its gross domestic product. Norges Bank Investment Management also considers the strength of a country’s public finances when investing in government bonds.
The majority of the investments are in developed countries, with a high percentage of government bonds denominated in euros, dollars, pounds and yen. About 13 percent of the bonds are in currencies from emerging markets. These bonds generally have an investment grade credit rating.
Corporate bonds
The investments in corporate bonds include debt issued by companies as well as covered bonds, or debt issued by banks that are secured by a portfolio of mortgage loans. Corporate bonds normally provide a higher return than government bonds.
All corporate bond investments are made after a credit assessment, either external or internal. Holdings in non-investment grade bonds are targeted to not exceed 5 percent of the overall fixed-income portfolio.

Additional coal exclusions from the Government Pension Fund Global
Norges Bank has decided to exclude 15 companies from the Government Pension Fund Global based on the product-based coal criterion in the guidelines for observation and exclusion.
The exclusions follow Norges Bank Investment Management’s second round of analysis of companies that may be affected by this criterion. The implementation comprises all companies’ subsidiaries that issue bonds. This is an expansion since the first round of analysis. The exception is green bonds, or subsidiaries that are deemed to have significant renewable energy activity.
In accordance with the guidelines, companies may be placed under observation where there is doubt as to whether the conditions for exclusion have been met, or as to future developments, or where observation is deemed appropriate for other reasons. Norges Bank has for this reason decided to place an additional 11 companies under observation.
In total, Norges Bank has so far excluded 59 companies and placed 11 companies under observation on the product-based coal criterion. Further exclusions will follow in 2017.
In accordance with the updated implementation of the criterion, the second round of analysis comprises another 30 subsidiaries that issue bonds. 21 of these are subsidiaries of companies excluded in the first round of analysis in April 2016 when 44 companies and 8 subsidiaries that issue bonds were excluded. In total, 38 subsidiaries that issue bonds have been excluded.
Norges Bank’s Executive Board made the observation and exclusion decisions based on recommendations from Norges Bank Investment Management. The Executive Board has found that the recommendations satisfy the criteria, and that the companies can be placed under observation or excluded from the fund (see § 2, subsection 2, of the Guidelines for observation and exclusion from the Government Pension Fund Global).

Norges Bank / Noregs Bank is the central bank of Norway. Apart from having traditional central bank responsibilities such as financial stability and price stability, it manages The Government Pension Fund of Norway, a stabilization fund that may be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.[1] The limited transparency of some SWFs makes it difficult to make accurate assessments of their assets under management.[2]
On 31 December 2010, the bank had 590 employees. All Executive Board appointments are made by the King of Norway, after a decision by the Council of State. The Chairman of the Executive Board, Øystein Olsen, who presides over the bank, is also the acting Central Bank Governor. Both the Governor and the Deputy Governor make speaking appearances across the country on a number of occasions each year.

History[edit]
The history of the central bank of Norway can be easily traced back to 1816, when, two years after the separation from Denmark and the union with Sweden, Norges Bank was established by Act of the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) on 14 June. The bank then decided that the monetary unit was to be the speciedaler (rixdollar), divided into 120 skillings or five ort ("rigsort") of 24 skillings each.[3]
The Money Act of 17 April 1875 discontinued the terms daler and skilling, and it was decided that the monetary unit should be a krone, divided into 100 øre. This was done to prepare for Norway's entry, on 16 October that year, into the Scandinavian Monetary Union. This union had been established between Denmark and Sweden in 1873 on the recommendation of a joint commission (in which Norway participated) to establish a common Scandinavian coin based on gold. It meant that the other countries' coins were to be legal tender on the same basis as those struck at home. The union functioned until 1914; thereafter it lacked all practical significance, but was not formally abolished until 1972.[3]
On 1 January 1897 the seat of Norges Bank was moved to Kristiania (Oslo), and in 1906 a new headquarters building on Bankplassen was opened - for 80 employees including the workers in the banknote printing plant.[3]
During the second world war, the seat of Norges Bank was temporarily moved to London in 1940, in that the Norwegian government-in-exile established a new board. The bank's gold reserves were evacuated via Åndalsnes, Molde and Tromsø to London, and from there to New York and Ottawa. This gold and the bank's other currency reserves were under the control of the London board. At the same time, the bank continued its operations in Norway under the direction of the Nazis until the war was over and the London board stepped down. A commission of inquiry after the war concluded that the Bank's Oslo management had taken a firm and correct attitude towards the Nazi authorities.[3] In 1962, the Mint Supervisory Authority and the Royal Mint were transferred from the state to Norges Bank.[3]
Norges Bank Investment Management[edit]
NBIM is a separate part of Norges Bank and is responsible for the operational management of the Government Pension Fund - Global. NBIM also manages Norges Bank's foreign exchange reserves. NBIM invests the fund's assets and the foreign exchange reserves in international equities and fixed income instruments, money market instruments and derivatives.

Norges Bank / Noregs Bank is the central bank of Norway. Apart from having traditional central bank responsibilities such as financial stability and price stability, it manages The Government Pension Fund of Norway, a stabilization fund that may be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.[1] The limited transparency of some SWFs makes it difficult to make accurate assessments of their assets under management.[2]
On 31 December 2010, the bank had 590 employees. All Executive Board appointments are made by the King of Norway, after a decision by the Council of State. The Chairman of the Executive Board, Øystein Olsen, who presides over the bank, is also the acting Central Bank Governor. Both the Governor and the Deputy Governor make speaking appearances across the country on a number of occasions each year.

History[edit]
The history of the central bank of Norway can be easily traced back to 1816, when, two years after the separation from Denmark and the union with Sweden, Norges Bank was established by Act of the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) on 14 June. The bank then decided that the monetary unit was to be the speciedaler (rixdollar), divided into 120 skillings or five ort ("rigsort") of 24 skillings each.[3]
The Money Act of 17 April 1875 discontinued the terms daler and skilling, and it was decided that the monetary unit should be a krone, divided into 100 øre. This was done to prepare for Norway's entry, on 16 October that year, into the Scandinavian Monetary Union. This union had been established between Denmark and Sweden in 1873 on the recommendation of a joint commission (in which Norway participated) to establish a common Scandinavian coin based on gold. It meant that the other countries' coins were to be legal tender on the same basis as those struck at home. The union functioned until 1914; thereafter it lacked all practical significance, but was not formally abolished until 1972.[3]
On 1 January 1897 the seat of Norges Bank was moved to Kristiania (Oslo), and in 1906 a new headquarters building on Bankplassen was opened - for 80 employees including the workers in the banknote printing plant.[3]
During the second world war, the seat of Norges Bank was temporarily moved to London in 1940, in that the Norwegian government-in-exile established a new board. The bank's gold reserves were evacuated via Åndalsnes, Molde and Tromsø to London, and from there to New York and Ottawa. This gold and the bank's other currency reserves were under the control of the London board. At the same time, the bank continued its operations in Norway under the direction of the Nazis until the war was over and the London board stepped down. A commission of inquiry after the war concluded that the Bank's Oslo management had taken a firm and correct attitude towards the Nazi authorities.[3] In 1962, the Mint Supervisory Authority and the Royal Mint were transferred from the state to Norges Bank.[3]
Norges Bank Investment Management[edit]
NBIM is a separate part of Norges Bank and is responsible for the operational management of the Government Pension Fund - Global. NBIM also manages Norges Bank's foreign exchange reserves. NBIM invests the fund's assets and the foreign exchange reserves in international equities and fixed income instruments, money market instruments and derivatives.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
