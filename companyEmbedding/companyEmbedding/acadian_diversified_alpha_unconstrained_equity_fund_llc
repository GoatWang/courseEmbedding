Acadian Diversified Alpha
         Back to Previous Page


            Published: 8/26/2015
        

            Diversified Alpha is a global absolute return strategy that seeks to generate modest positive returns in most market environments, with low correlation to a variety of asset classes. Implementation is via a beta-neutral long/short portfolio that leverages Acadian’s experience capturing the mispricing of fundamentals as well as the mispricing of risk within the cross-section of equities.

Inception Date

Minimum Investment      
$2,500  





(Formerly known as the Cambiar Unconstrained Equity Fund). The Cambiar Global Ultra Focus Fund is a concentrated, non-diversified portfolio that is made up of the highest conviction names from our Opportunity, Small Cap, SMID and International Equity Funds.  In general, portfolio construction is based on a stock by stock analysis.  The investment team will rely heavily on fundamentals and valuations, while taking into consideration global macro events.

The Fund may also engage in some proprietary shorting that Cambiar calls parent-subsidiary arbitrage (PASA).  At certain times, the market valuation of a parent company and that of the subsidiary can become disconnected and nonsensical, creating unique opportunities.


Non-diversified fund designed for long-term capital appreciation


Concentrated 20-30 stock portfolio.


Global portfolio with a bias towards U.S. stocks.


Fund may hold derivatives, pair trades and occasional short positions.

Disclosure
The Global Ultra Focus Fund was formerly known as the Cambiar Unconstrained Equity Fund.
Mutual fund investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.  In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations.  Emerging Markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify the Fund's gains or losses. With short sales, you risk paying more for a security than you received from its sale. Short sales losses are potentially unlimited and the expenses involved with the shorting strategy may negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Diversification may not protect against market risk. The Cambiar Global Ultra Focus Fund is a non-diversified fund. This material represents the portfolio manager’s opinion and is an assessment of the market environment at a specific point in time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results. This information should not be relied upon by the reader as research or investment advice or a specific recommendation of securities.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund’s prospectus which can be obtained by clicking here or calling 1-866-777-8227. Please read it carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that the Funds will meet their stated objectives.
Performance data quotes are past performance and does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. For performance data current to the most recent month-end, please call 1-866-777-8227.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. CAMAX was rated against 714 World Stock funds over a three year period and 590 funds over a five year period. With respect to these World Stock funds, CAMAX received a rating of 1 stars for the three year and 4 stars for the five year period, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Russell 3000 Index returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Individuals cannot invest directly in an Index.
P/E ratio 1 YR Forecast is a calculation that divides the current share price by the estimates of earnings in the next four quarters. Debt/Equity - Long Term is a calculation that takes interest bearing, long-term debt divided by shareholder equity. EPS Growth - Long Term is a calculation that takes the company’s estimated profits for five years divided by the outstanding shares. Active share is a holdings-based measure of active management representing the percentage of securities in a portfolio that differ from those in the benchmark index. Alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted performance. Beta is a measure of risk in relation to the market or benchmark. The Sharpe Ratio is a direct measure of reward-to-risk and is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the rate of return for a portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation. Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of historical volatility; a measure of the extent to which numbers are spread around their average. R-Squared measures how closely a portfolio’s performance correlates with the performance of a benchmark index.  These calculations are not a forecast of the Fund’s future performance.

Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.




StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

Product management

Vanguard Global Equity Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing worldwide in growth and value stocks of all capitalization sizes. The advisors’ bottom-up stock selection results in a diversified global portfolio invested across sectors and both developed and emerging markets.
			







Acadian Asset Management LLCAcadian employs a quantitative investment process that seeks to outperform the MSCI All Country World Free Index.  The investment process builds portfolios from the bottom up using proprietary valuation models measuring over 20 stock factors and focusing those that have proven most effective in predicting returns. The result is a rating of all securities in the Acadian database, in terms of each stock’s expected return relative to its country- and sector-level group. A portfolio optimization program is used to balance the expected return of the stocks with such considerations as the benchmark index, desired level of risk, and transaction cost estimates.Firm DescriptionFounded in 1986, Acadian Asset Management is a Boston-based investment management firm specializing in quantitative equity strategies for developed and emerging markets.  The firm has advised Vanguard Global Equity Fund since 2004.Investment Manager BiographiesJohn R.

In managing its portion of the fund’s assets, the firm employs a fundamental “bottom up” approach to identify growth companies, screening them for quality, then value. The main factors considered are sustainable earnings growth, cash-flow generation, profitability, interest coverage, and valuation.Firm DescriptionBaillie Gifford Overseas Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland—a unit of Baillie Gifford & Co., founded in 1908—is among the largest independently owned investment management firms in the United Kingdom.

Traditional company analysis is de-emphasized in favor of assessing enterprise value, corporate strategy, industry competition, and prospective rate of return on new investments. Sector analysis is conducted using long-term capital cycle data, and country allocations tend to reflect monetary conditions and investor confidence. Individual stock concentrations are low, with the top 25 stocks comprising only 20%–30% of portfolio assets. The subportfolio’s country and industry sector allocations may vary significantly from the benchmark.Firm DescriptionFounded in 1986, Marathon Asset Management, LLP, of London, England, specializes in applying nontraditional analytical techniques to global portfolios.

Boston-based fund manager cites collateral management and accounting expertise as differentiators
WINDSOR, Conn., May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:   SSNC), a global provider of financial services software and software-enabled services, today announced that Acadian Asset Management LLC (Acadian) recently transitioned its long/short portfolios to SS&C GlobeOp. Acadian has been leveraging SS&C GlobeOp as its fund administrator for long-short strategies since Acadian launched its Diversified Alpha equity strategy in 2016. SS&C provides a comprehensive range of middle and back office services to Acadian for its long/short business. 








Acadian cited a number of factors that were critical in its decision, including SS&C's fund administration leadership as well as extensive middle office expertise. Most notably for Acadian were SS&C GlobeOp's capabilities around margin finance management, cash and collateral management, and tri-party reconciliation. As part of the agreement, SS&C will provide Acadian its world class long/short fund administration services with Syncova, a powerful end-to-end margin management and financing software. 
"The appointment followed a detailed search and due diligence process across the major fund administrators in the market," said Tara Norton, Senior Vice President, Director, Hedge Fund & Alternative Asset Operations, Acadian. "SS&C was able to clearly demonstrate their ability to service large, complex, long-short fund managers across a broad range of asset classes and they were unrivaled in terms of technology offering. Above all, we selected SS&C because of their commitment to client service and integrity."
