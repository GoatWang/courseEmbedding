How to Light a Room: The Specs That Matter
In order to set the tone of a room and achieve the look you want, it's important to be aware of what a light's specifications say about its output. 
                    Learning how to light a room with LED lights depends on more than brightness and lumens. 
                    Do you want to create a relaxed environment, one that's lively and bright, or one that's romantic? 
                    Any look is possible with the right LED lights. 
                    They're available in a variety of intensities, color temperatures (shades) and with different beam angles, dimming capabilities, and color-rendering indexes (CRI).








Lumens

 
Lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source. 
                    The higher the lumen count, the brighter the light source.
                    Lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new LED light bulbs or fixtures.
                    They're a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage.
                    An LED light with an output that's comparable to a 60-watt incandescent bulb might only consume 10 watts of power.
                    Kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial, but brightness, as with any other lighting choice, is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room.
                    LED bulbs are available in many intensities, but those intensities often depend on the light's color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted.
                





Correlated Color Temperature (CCT)








CCT indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture. 
                    It's measured in Kelvins (K), which is similar to degrees in Celsius. 
                    Different temperatures on the Kelvin scale represent different colors. 
                    For example, light at 2000K-3500K looks more orange/yellow and is called ultra warm or warm white, and as temperature increases in Kelvins, color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white (between 3500K and 5100K) and finally into a bluish-white known as cool white (5100K+). 
                    As a light source's color temperature increases, brightness often increases.
                    While shopping for LED lights, pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture. 
                    Choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around 3000K might mean sacrificing some brightness. 
                    Whereas, if you choose the natural white version, it's likely that it will have a higher output.
                

Traditionally, different rooms are associated with different tones. For example, living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light. 
                    A warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room, is least likely to show imperfections, and appears less bright when compared to higher CCTs.
                    In kitchens, basements, garages, and other areas where tasks are completed, it's standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp, bright white light that they emit.
                





Color-Rendering Index (CRI)










CRI indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects, people, clothing, etc. when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight.
                    The closer a light’s CRI is to 100 (the CRI of incandescent light or daylight), the better the color rendition of objects under that light.
                    Any room can benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    They're great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately. Kitchens, closets, bathrooms, dressing rooms, and other areas where presentation, appearance, and depth of color are important can also benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    Accurate color rendering can be achieved with a high-cri light strip, can light, globe bulb, linear light, or other high-CRI bulb or fixture.
                    Lights with a CRI of 80 or higher are considered to show colors most accurately. The CRI of an LED light generally ranges from 70 to 98.
                




Nanometers


In order to understand nanometers, you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths. 
                    The electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light, and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves.
                    Wavelengths are measured in nanometers, which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum. 
                    Nanometers will tell you how red, green, yellow, purple, etc. a light source really is. 
                    These measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue, yellow, orange, and then red.
                    The wavelength of a colored light can be found in the light's specifications table.
                





Beam Angle





Fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams, such as LED panel lights or BR LED bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light, such as basements, kitchens, or living rooms. 
                    Narrow beam angles like those from can lights with LED PAR bulbs or track lights with MR LED bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas. Globe bulbs, such as A19 or G30 LED vanity bulbs, have 360-degree beam angles, which means that they throw light in all directions. 
                    Globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures.
                



Beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point (the center) and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is 50 percent as bright.
                    A larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles. 
                    While it depends on the angle and individual retailers, small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams, and larger angles (usually anything above 90 degrees) are considered flood beams.
                







Dimmability


Dimmable LED bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match its function during a particular time. 
                    For example, in a living room or theater room, you might want low light for watching TV but high light output for a gathering of friends.
                    They're also great for bathrooms where you need bright light to get ready but want dim lighting for relaxing in a bathtub. 
                    Dimmable chandelier bulbs, for example, can create the perfect atmosphere for a family dinner while also allowing enough light for the room to function as a work space for school projects. 
                    When dimmed, these LED lights also reduce energy consumption. 
                    They're available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and colors from A19 LED bulbs to LED panel lights and retrofit LED can lights.

Change colors with the season with RGB LED Wall Washing. UL Listed for Wet Location - Indoor or Outdoor Use

36 RGB LED Wall Washers with a 45 degree beam angle
The head of this LED wall washer can be swiveled side to side 30 degrees in either direction and rotated up or down a full 150 degrees. You can aim it virtually in any direction. It is dust proof, weatherproof and water resistant, so can be used indoors or outdoors. Highlight buildings, gardens, landscape, stage sets, restaurants and clubs.

Use an external DMX color controller or software to achieve thousands of possible effects and colors
Several wall washers can be linked together and can be synchronized. This applies to stand alone mode or DMX mode.

LED Lighting Facts® Products



                    Welcome to the LED Lighting Facts Product List! 
                    The searchable list includes LED luminaires and retrofit kits with verified performance information for each product.
                

Update 12.16.2016: Due to changes in the market as well as in replacement-lamp testing requirements, LED Lighting Facts is no longer listing replacement lamps, but luminaires and retrofit kits continue to be listed. 
                
Once you have narrowed your search criteria, click on the search button. You can further refine your search by clicking on the section headers. LED Lighting Facts expanded the characteristics by which a product can be defined; manufacturers have the option of confirming a product's mounting base, subcategory, size and use location. Some products may not include all of the characteristics and therefore may not appear in a search using additional criteria. The program encourages all manufacturers to review their listed products and apply the new designations.

Click here to see the FEMP Acquisition Guidance for Lighting Products.
                    For assistance when evaluating if LED products are appropriate for a given application, see the residential and commercial performance scales.

How to Light a Room: The Specs That Matter
In order to set the tone of a room and achieve the look you want, it's important to be aware of what a light's specifications say about its output. 
                    Learning how to light a room with LED lights depends on more than brightness and lumens. 
                    Do you want to create a relaxed environment, one that's lively and bright, or one that's romantic? 
                    Any look is possible with the right LED lights. 
                    They're available in a variety of intensities, color temperatures (shades) and with different beam angles, dimming capabilities, and color-rendering indexes (CRI).








Lumens

 
Lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source. 
                    The higher the lumen count, the brighter the light source.
                    Lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new LED light bulbs or fixtures.
                    They're a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage.
                    An LED light with an output that's comparable to a 60-watt incandescent bulb might only consume 10 watts of power.
                    Kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial, but brightness, as with any other lighting choice, is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room.
                    LED bulbs are available in many intensities, but those intensities often depend on the light's color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted.
                





Correlated Color Temperature (CCT)








CCT indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture. 
                    It's measured in Kelvins (K), which is similar to degrees in Celsius. 
                    Different temperatures on the Kelvin scale represent different colors. 
                    For example, light at 2000K-3500K looks more orange/yellow and is called ultra warm or warm white, and as temperature increases in Kelvins, color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white (between 3500K and 5100K) and finally into a bluish-white known as cool white (5100K+). 
                    As a light source's color temperature increases, brightness often increases.
                    While shopping for LED lights, pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture. 
                    Choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around 3000K might mean sacrificing some brightness. 
                    Whereas, if you choose the natural white version, it's likely that it will have a higher output.
                

Traditionally, different rooms are associated with different tones. For example, living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light. 
                    A warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room, is least likely to show imperfections, and appears less bright when compared to higher CCTs.
                    In kitchens, basements, garages, and other areas where tasks are completed, it's standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp, bright white light that they emit.
                





Color-Rendering Index (CRI)










CRI indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects, people, clothing, etc. when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight.
                    The closer a light’s CRI is to 100 (the CRI of incandescent light or daylight), the better the color rendition of objects under that light.
                    Any room can benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    They're great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately. Kitchens, closets, bathrooms, dressing rooms, and other areas where presentation, appearance, and depth of color are important can also benefit from high-CRI LED lights.
                    Accurate color rendering can be achieved with a high-cri light strip, can light, globe bulb, linear light, or other high-CRI bulb or fixture.
                    Lights with a CRI of 80 or higher are considered to show colors most accurately. The CRI of an LED light generally ranges from 70 to 98.
                




Nanometers


In order to understand nanometers, you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths. 
                    The electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light, and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves.
                    Wavelengths are measured in nanometers, which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum. 
                    Nanometers will tell you how red, green, yellow, purple, etc. a light source really is. 
                    These measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue, yellow, orange, and then red.
                    The wavelength of a colored light can be found in the light's specifications table.
                





Beam Angle





Fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams, such as LED panel lights or BR LED bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light, such as basements, kitchens, or living rooms. 
                    Narrow beam angles like those from can lights with LED PAR bulbs or track lights with MR LED bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas. Globe bulbs, such as A19 or G30 LED vanity bulbs, have 360-degree beam angles, which means that they throw light in all directions. 
                    Globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures.
                



Beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point (the center) and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is 50 percent as bright.
                    A larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles. 
                    While it depends on the angle and individual retailers, small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams, and larger angles (usually anything above 90 degrees) are considered flood beams.
                







Dimmability


Dimmable LED bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match its function during a particular time. 
                    For example, in a living room or theater room, you might want low light for watching TV but high light output for a gathering of friends.
                    They're also great for bathrooms where you need bright light to get ready but want dim lighting for relaxing in a bathtub. 
                    Dimmable chandelier bulbs, for example, can create the perfect atmosphere for a family dinner while also allowing enough light for the room to function as a work space for school projects. 
                    When dimmed, these LED lights also reduce energy consumption. 
                    They're available in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and colors from A19 LED bulbs to LED panel lights and retrofit LED can lights.

About LightUp.com


Welcome to Lightup.com, the leading online vendor of high-quality LED lighting for homes, offices, and warehouses. We carry thousands of different lighting products, including bulbs, spotlights, downlights, T8 and T5 tubes, high bays, low bays, panel lights and more. Free shipping on qualifying orders at the lowest prices. 

LED Savings
LED lights and replacement bulbs save you money on energy from the day you install them. In many cases, they use less than half the energy of the fluorescent tubes. If you are replacing standard incandescent bulbs, LEDs will save upwards of 85% of your energy usage. You may also be able to claim rebates from your electricity supplier. With so many ways to save money on your electricity bill, switch to LED today!
  We provide great quality products with all relevant safety certifications such as ETL and UL; as well as energy conservation qualifications including Energy Star©, Design Lights Consortium™ (DLC)and Title 24.

We accept purchase orders over $1,000 subject to credit approval.
Lightup.com is a division of Online Stores, LLC, a well funded, privately owned, stable company that was founded in 2002. We operate from our over 100,000 square foot facility in New Stanton, PA with 75 staff currently employed.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
