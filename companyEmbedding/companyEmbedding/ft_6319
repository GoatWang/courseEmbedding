When I ordered this product I expected a quality rug. What I received was a very thin rubber backed nylon mat, the type of rug that you put on your bathroom floor. If you're looking for an oversized bath mat then go for it. If you're expecting a quality area rug, don't waist your time.
At least the Home Depot allowed me to return my online order back to the store directly for a refund, which saved me shipping chargers. I don't fault the store at all, but if I can save another customer from complete dissatisfaction then it was worth posting.

 Lakewood Estates & Lakewood Villas

                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas

                Description


                    Description



 With its smooth spectral curve and stable output, the 6319 Quartz Tungsten Halogen (QTH) Lamp is a popular visible and near infrared light source. This lamp uses a dense rectangular filament, producing high image brightness. It does not exhibit the sharp spectral peaks characteristic of arc lamps and emits little UV radiation. A doped tungsten filament is positioned inside a quartz envelope. The envelope is filled with rare gas and a small amount of halogen. Current flowing through the filament heats the tungsten; the white light produced radiates through the clear envelope.

                    This is a quiet community located north of Tampa, but has easy access to all the big city has to offer, now that the new Suncoast parkway (toll road) is completed. This town provides affordable housing , good schools and city services, easy access  to beaches, great dining and entertainment venues. Located approximately 25 miles north of downtown Tampa, many who work in the city commute daily with no problem, but find Springhill to offer some relief from the hustle and bustle of the big city.
