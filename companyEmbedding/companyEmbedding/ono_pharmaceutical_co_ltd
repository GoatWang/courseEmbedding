A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

About Ono

Manufacturing
For the Stable Supply of Drugs that Can Be Used with Peace of Mind 
Pharmaceuticals are products concerned with life, they play a crucial role in maintaining health and in treating diseases. It is necessary to assure their quality to a high standard and to ensure their stable supply. Accordingly, we not only meet the legal requirements as a manufacturer and marketer, but also create our own quality manual to establish a drug quality system and work to develop and continuously improve quality pharmaceutical products from the viewpoints of patients, caretakers and healthcare professionals. In addition, we contribute to society through stable supply of pharmaceutical products that are assured to a high quality standard.

Efforts to Ensure Reliability
At ONO, all the divisions involved in manufacturing cooperate closely with each other and they consistently maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ethics as they perform evidence-based manufacturing operations and continuously make maximum efforts toward the stable supply of drugs of assured quality.
	We also have a system in place to ensure reliability through preparation of drug risk management plans and operation of the drug quality system, so that patients and medical professionals can use our pharmaceutical products in a safe and reliable manner.

Production System Optimization
We continually review production systems and invest in suitable plant and equipment for further optimization of marketed products, while keeping in mind the timing of marketing, quantities and product features relevant to the production system structure for products destined for market launch.

Improvement of Quality Check System Reliability
We deliver only products that have been ascertained to have assured quality by monitoring safety and efficacy information and by checking manufacturing and testing records as well as visually inspecting all products.

Productivity Improvement
We strive to improve productivity, driving laborsaving initiatives such as automation of production processes, as well as careful examination of cost structures, from pharmaceutical substance to pharmaceutical production.

Human Resources Development
We strive to develop our human resources through specialist training for workers involved in production, passing skills from experienced technicians to young employees, in-house personnel exchange, and training in anticipation of globalization.

Risk Management
We have a risk management system in place to ensure stable drug supply. Our system is based on proper production facility management, ensuring proper product quantities, and avoiding the impacts of power outages by equipping production centers with emergency power provisions.

Maintenance of Product Recall System
We have a system in place to recall any products with efficacy, quality or safety problems, and to promptly provide medical professionals with information on them. We conduct periodical drills in preparation for recall to check that product recalls can be executed quickly even in unexpected circumstances.

Efforts toward the Proper Use of Pharmaceutical Products
We strive to prevent medication errors through various measures, including clear labeling on containers to avoid drug confusion by patients, their families and medical professionals, as well as printing the drug name and contents clearly on PTP sheets even after they are split up.
		We are also developing packaging of products on which necessary information can be marked to prevent patients from misusing them.
		Collecting and providing drug safety (side effects) information is a crucial role for pharmaceutical companies. The information is collected through reports from patients and medical professionals, reviews of academic papers, surveys conducted by pharmaceutical companies and other means. We assess the collected information and accordingly revise precautionary statements in the package inserts when necessary.


Fujiyama Plant�iShizuoka�j

Production Centers with Established High Quality and Productivity
Our production centers in Shizuoka and Osaka are compliant with GMP (a set of standards relating to the manufacturing control and quality control of pharmaceuticals). The Fujiyama Plant, our key production center, constructed in Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture in 1975, has continually improved and expanded its facilities, so that today the plant boasts computer-controlled manufacturing facilities. In 1999, a large-scale injection manufacturing plant was constructed within the grounds of the Fujiyama Plant, equipped with high-performance automation facilities. In 2009, a solid formulation manufacturing plant equipped with state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities was newly constructed. In May 2014 an injection line equipped with manufacturing facilities to handle highly active and antibody drugs was completed, including facilities that can handle new drugs through development phase.
	The injection manufacturing plant is equipped with high-performance facilities and world-class software that comply not only with Japanese but also European and U.S. GMP standards. Computers are used to give all the necessary operational commands in the manufacturing process, to check such operations, and to gather and record data. Industrial robots are used in all processes, from receiving pharmaceutical substances to the dispatch of finished products. The solid formulation manufacturing plant utilizes high-speed, high-performance machinery for thorough quality assurance.

Vigorous Activities for Licensing Initiatives
We continue to forge ahead with licensing activities to introduce new drug candidates with the aim of introducing compounds attractive for diseases with high therapeutic need, and compounds that have high value in terms of corporate strategy and efficiency, while taking into consideration the development pipeline and existing products. Our aim is to expand the development pipeline to provide a continuous stream of new market launches. In 2014, we signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) regarding immuno-oncology therapies, and a development collaboration agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin and BMS regarding immuno-oncology therapies.
	We are simultaneously directing efforts into out-licensing to overseas alliance companies so that patients around the world can use the new drugs we discover. In 2014, we signed a out-licensing and joint development agreement with Gilead Sciences (U.S.A.) regarding BTK inhibitor ONO-4059, and collaboration agreements with Meiji Seika Pharma and China Chemical & Pharmaceutical regarding development and commercialization of the oral prostaglandin E1 analogue Limaprost.
	Continuously promoting vigorous licensing activities, we are making steady progress in expanding development pipeline and developing a road map for global business to deliver new drugs we develop.

About Ono

Marketing
True Value of Drugs Enhanced by Proper Drug Information Supply, Gathering and Feedback 
Even if a drug is an excellent product, it is of no value unless it can be used correctly in medical treatment and be delivered to those who are suffering from disease.
	Moreover, drugs could determine life or death. It is of paramount importance that accurate information is supplied appropriately. Our Medical Representatives (MRs) shoulder this all-important role of communicating drug information.
	MRs visit medical professionals to provide information on proper drug usage, as well as to provide and collect information on drug efficacy and safety. The mission of MRs is to contribute to society by providing healthcare support in collaboration with medical professionals for the benefit of patient treatment, in accordance with high ethical standards.

Information Sharing Framework Architecture

In addition to providing information, MRs uphold the importance of exchanging information with medical professionals to ascertain whether our drugs truly benefit each individual patient and their family throughout the course of the patient’s treatment.
	ONO’s information-sharing framework enables our MRs to share across the company the valuable information they gather from the frontline of healthcare. Our MR-support website carries a wide variety of information, notably the Product Q&A, a resource based on analysis of all information accumulated to date, as well as safety information, promotional materials, information on academic societies, conferences and research papers, and information on sponsored seminars. We also have a system in place that allows all the MRs to access useful information at all times from their tablet devices.
	All the MRs are equipped with highly secure smartphones. The smartphones feature a sales force automation (SFA) system that makes the entire sales process more efficient, as well as functions for using the FAQ system.
	Our structure promotes information sharing and enables them quick responses to healthcare providers’ needs.

Relaying Up-to-date Drug Information to the Frontline of Healthcare

Medical technology undergoes daily advances and the same is true of pharmaceutical products. It is one of the roles of drug manufacturers to relay as quickly as possible up-to-date information about such drugs and to provide opportunities for information exchange. We actively provide information by organizing symposiums and seminars in conjunction with academic conferences held in Japan and through workshops and lectures in regional areas. We are also putting efforts into information technology-based measures, for example, live webinars and disease information dissemination from our ONO Medical Navi and ONO ONCOLOGY websites.
	In addition, we have been developing a framework that enables MRs to respond rapidly to the high-level needs of oncologists at universities and oncology institutes. In 2014, we appointed specialist MRs dedicated to oncology due to the launch of new products in this highly specialized field.

Enhancement of MR Training Programs

We are enhancing MR training programs as we increase the investment in our MRs, for the sake of their development.
	We provide training programs focusing on our products and related diseases and we also continuously provide training programs intended to familiarize MRs with the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) Code of Practice to build mutual relationships with researchers, medical professionals, and patient organizations. Training programs are delivered at Head Office and branches across the country to ensure that even amendments or supplementary articles are appropriately made known to all our MRs.
	Moreover, MRs do on-site training at specialist institutions for dementia, diabetes, and cancer to enable them to identify the needs of patients and their families for delivery of drugs that truly benefit patients.
	In the field of dementia in particular, all our MRs have completed the Dementia Supporter Training Course — which aims to “get the facts straight on dementia, support people with dementia and their families, and carry on improving the amenity of everyday life for all members of society” — and work in a supporter capacity.
	We enjoy the support and cooperation of medical institutions for these efforts.
	Experience that cannot be gained only through normal MR activities is incorporated into marketing work that distinguishes ONO MRs from the rest, aiming to truly benefit patients and place importance on the views of patients and their families.

OPDIVO® Intravenous Infusion for Treatment of Malignant Tumor
OPDIVO® is a human anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody. PD-1 (programmed death-1), a receptor expressed on the surface of lymphocytes, plays a role in a regulatory pathway that suppresses activated lymphocytes in the body (negative signal). Available evidence suggests that cancer cells exploit this pathway to escape from immune responses. OPDIVO® is thought to provide benefit by blocking PD-1-mediated negative regulation of lymphocytes (i.e., the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2), thereby enhancing the ability of the immune system to recognize cancer cells as foreign and eliminate them. OPDIVO® is the world's first approved drug targeting PD-1.
FY 2016 Sales: 103.9 billion yen (Launched September 2014)



KYPROLIS® for Intravenous Injection
KYPROLIS® is in a class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome, an intra-cellular enzyme complex, functions to mediate degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins and control proliferation and differentiation of cells, as well as functional cell-death. It inhibits certain proteasome activity, thereby inducing functional cell-death of myeloma. KYPROLIS was launched on August 2016.
FY 2016 Sales: 2.0 billion yen (Launched August 2016)



EMEND® Capsules / PROEMEND® Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting
EMEND® is the first selective neurokinin (NK) 1 receptor antagonist in the world. The drug is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
	In June 2012, an additional application for EMEND for pediatric patients aged 12 years and older was approved. Also, in March 2015, PROEMEND�@received additional approval for use in infants over 6months and in pediatric patients under 12-years of age.
FY 2016 Sales: 9.9 billion yen (Launched December 2009)



GLACTIV® Tablets for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes
GLACTIV®, a dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 4 inhibitor, is an oral drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes. It regulates blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients with the mechanism of action selectively inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme which metabolites a gastrointestinal hormone, incretins. It thereby enhances the body's own insulin secretion ability in a glucose dependent manner and decreases glucagon release, signaling the liver to reduce its production of glucose.
FY 2016 Sales: 29.4 billion yen (Launched December 2009)



FORXIGA® Tablets for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes
FORXIGA® is a therapy that reduces blood sugar by excreting excess blood glucose via urine through the inhibition of SGLT2, a transporter that acts to regulate reabsorption of glucose in the kidney tubules. It is an oral drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and improves high blood sugar after meals and fasting blood sugar level, independently of insulin.
FY 2016 Sales: 7.8 billion yen (Launched May 2014)



KINEDAK® Tablets for the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
KINEDAK® is the first aldose reductase inhibitor marketed in Japan. By blocking aldose reductase which is activated under hyperglycemia, the drug reduces the production of sorbitol, which is involved in the development of neurological disorders associated with diabetes, and thereby alleviates accompanying symptoms such as numbness, pain and cramp in hands and feet and controls progress of the disease.
FY 2016 Sales: 2.9 billion yen



RECALBON® Tablets for the Treatment of Osteoporosis
RECALBON®, a drug for the treatment of osteoporosis, is the first oral bisphosphonate discovered in Japan. It is one of the most potent bisphosphonates, rapidly preventing bone resorption, and is the first bisphosphonate that demonstrated significant effect in bone fracture prevention over placebo in Japanese osteoporosis patients. In September 2011, a Once Per 4 Weeks 50mg formulation was launched in addition to the Once-Daily 1mg formulation.
FY 2016 Sales: 11.3 billion yen (Launched April 2009)



ORENCIA® for Subcutaneous Injection for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis
ORENCIA® is the subcutaneous injection for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.
	Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition where immune system attacks its own cells and tissues, and is known for inducing joint inflammation by the excessively produced cytokines. ORENCIA® is a biologic therapy that inhibits secretion of cytokines by blocking the signal which activates T cells, resulting in the easing of joint inflammation.
FY 2016 Sales: 11.6 billion yen (Launched August 2013)



RIVASTACH® Patch for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
RIVASTACH® Patch is a transdermal patch for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It reduces the progression of deteriorating cognitive functions such as memory loss (forgetfulness) and disorientation (inability to recognizing time and place) by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and thereby increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the brain and enhancing neurotransmission.
FY 2016 Sales: 8.9 billion yen (Launched July 2011)



ONOACT® for Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Intra-operative or Post-operative Tachyarrhythmia, or Tachyarrhythmia in Left Ventricular Dysfunction
ONOACT® is a short-acting β1 blocker that selectively blocks β1 receptors mainly found in the heart. It is for emergency treatment of intra-operative or post-operative tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia), and for treatment of tachyarrhythmia in left ventricular dysfunction (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter).
FY 2016 Sales: 5.7 billion yen



Staybla® Tablets for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder (OAB)
Staybla® is an anticholinergic, an antagonist selectively binding to M3 and M1 muscarinic receptors. By reducing the excessive contraction of the smooth cells of the bladder, it is effective in symptoms associated with OAB including frequent urination, urinary incontinence, and urgency of urination. In April 2011, orally disintegrating tablets (OD tablets) were launched as additional formulation.
FY 2016 Sales: 4.8 billion yen (Launched June 2007)



OPALMON® Tablets for the Treatment of Peripheral Circulatory Disorder
OPALMON® is an orally administered prostaglandin-E1 derivative for the treatment of subjective symptoms and walking disability associated with acquired lumbar spinal canal stenosis and ischemic symptoms accompanying thromboangiitis obliterans. It improves symptoms caused by peripheral circulatory disorder such as numbness, pain or coldness of the hands or feet.
FY 2016 Sales: 17.0 billion yen



ONON® Capsules for the Treatment of Bronchial Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
