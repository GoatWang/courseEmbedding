New and exciting developments in the nutraceutical industry.

FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead. 


May 6, 2014
Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral ingestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.


April 25, 2014
Blended Protein Manuacturing Benefits
A double blind randomized clinical trial conducted by the University of Texas Medial Branch compared amino acid delivery to the muscle using soy-dairy protein blend versus a single whey protein. The soy-dairy protein blend delivered key amino acids roughly one hour longer than the whey protein blend.

 Company had a 1-1000 R/S in Nov 2014.  What was nice of them, and doesn't happen too often anymore is they offered a 100 Share Roundup. Anybody that had less than 100 shares after the R/S would get rounded up to 100 shares.  Taken a long time for those roundup shares to hit peoples accounts, but looks like today (1-6-15) a lot of peeps got em.  I'm betting she'll do a Forward Split and go up nicely.
