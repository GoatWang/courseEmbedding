Overview



An eBook-only edition of the UK instant bestselling biography of Britain’s newest princess Kate Middleton—from her childhood to the royal wedding. Kate is the definitive biography of Britain's newest princess. Bestselling author Sean Smith has retraced the steps of Kate's journey, from her childhood in rural Berkshire and her unhappy time as a victim of school bullies, to her transformation from a plain, gangly girl into the beauty she is today. He reveals the true story of how the romance with William blossomed at St Andrews University and, later, how they managed to survive as a couple after the relationship hit the rocks in 2007. Smith examines Kate's time spent as a royal apprentice and her evolving role as an ambassador for British fashion. The story ends in Westminster Abbey where Kate and William married, describing all the glamor and spectacle of their big day, and the event of the decade.
