The global healthcare industry sits at the intersection of several powerful long-term growth trends led by global demographics and the ineluctable advance of scientific innovation in treating disease. These trends have caused a steady increase in the level of healthcare spending in the industrialized world, led by the U.S. which now spends over 17% of its GDP on healthcare. The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 of this Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as set forth below:


Arrangement Agreement


On June 16, 2016 the Issuer entered into a plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with 1077801 B.C. Ltd. (“Acquireco”), a company owned by certain OrbiMed funds and Shanghai Runda Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Runda”), pursuant to which Acquireco would acquire all of the outstanding Shares (except for Shares held by certain rollover shareholders who will instead receive shares of the Acquireco on a 1:1 ratio) at a price of CDN $1.12 per Share in cash (“Arrangement Consideration”). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement was subject to certain closing conditions including the adoption of the Arrangement Agreement by at least two-thirds of the votes at the Special Meeting and certain regulatory, court and stock exchange consents. Upon the consummation of the Arrangement Agreement, the Issuer would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquireco.
 





 
On September 16, 2016, at a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s shareholders voted to approve the Arrangement Agreement and the consummation of the statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) pursuant to which Acquireco would acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company (the “Arrangement”).


On September 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of British Columbia approved the Arrangement.


On November 29, 2016, the Company consummated the Arrangement pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquireco. At the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”), each share of the Company’s common stock, without par value per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than certain excluded shares, was converted into the right to receive CDN $1.12 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.


As a result of the Arrangement, the Company’s common stock has ceased to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and from quotation on the OTC market.  The Company intends to file with the SEC a certification and notice of termination on Form 15 to terminate or suspend its reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as promptly as practicable.


Rollover Agreements


Concurrently with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, the Acquireco entered into rollover agreements (the “Rollover Agreements”) with OrbiMed Associates, OPI III and OAP (collectively, the “Rollovers”). Pursuant to the Rollover Agreements, the Rollovers agreed, among other things, to contribute all of their Shares in exchange for shares of Acquireco.
                  

The descriptions of the Arrangement Agreement and the Rollover Agreements set forth above in this Item 4 do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Arrangement Agreement and the Rollover Agreements, which have been filed as Exhibits T, U and V, and are incorporated herein by this reference.


Except as set forth in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons have not formulated any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in:  (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of securities of the Issuer, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board, (e) any material change in the Issuer’s capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer, (f) any other material change in the Issuer’s business or corporate structure, (g) any change in the Issuer’s charter or bylaws or other instrument corresponding thereto or other action which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person, (h) causing a class of the Issuer’s securities to be deregistered or delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association, (i) a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
 





 
Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer
 
(a) — (b) See Item 4 above.


As a result of the Arrangement Agreement and the Rollover Agreements (as defined and described in Item 4 of this Schedule 13D), the Reporting Persons no longer beneficially own any Shares.
            
(c) Except as disclosed in Item 4, none of the Reporting Persons has effected any transaction during the past sixty (60) days in any Shares.
 
(d) Not applicable.
 
(e) Not applicable.
 
Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer
 
In addition to the relationships between the Reporting Persons described in Item 5 above, OrbiMed Capital is the sole general partner of OPI III, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OPI III.  Pursuant to this agreement and relationship, OrbiMed Capital has discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OPI III.  Such authority includes the power to vote and otherwise dispose of securities held by OPI III.  
                 
     OrbiMed Advisors is the sole managing member of OrbiMed Capital, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of OrbiMed Capital.  Pursuant to these agreements and relationships, OrbiMed Advisors and OrbiMed Capital have discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OPI III.  Such authority includes the power of OrbiMed Capital to vote and otherwise dispose of securities held by OPI III.   OrbiMed Advisors is also the general partner of OrbiMed Associates, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OrbiMed Associates.  Pursuant to this agreement and relationship, OrbiMed Advisors has discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OrbiMed Associates.  Such authority includes the power to vote and otherwise dispose of securities held by OrbiMed Associates.  
 
     OrbiMed Asia is the sole general partner of OAP pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OAP.  OrbiMed Limited is the sole general partner of OrbiMed Asia pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OrbiMed Asia.  OrbiMed Limited established the Committee by written resolutions adopted on July 28, 2010.  Pursuant to these agreements, resolutions and relationships, OrbiMed Asia has discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OAP and such discretionary investment management authority is exercised through OrbiMed Limited by action of the Committee. Such authority includes the power to vote and otherwise dispose of securities held by OAP. 
 





 
Following consummation of the Arrangement (as defined and described in Item 4), none of the Reporting Persons holds any Shares.
     
Xiaoying (Ken) Xu and Jonathan J. Wang, employees of OrbiMed Advisors, are members of the Issuer’s Board and, accordingly, the Reporting Persons may have the ability to effect and influence control of the Issuer.
 
     Other than the agreements and the relationships mentioned directly above and in Items 4 and 5 hereof, to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in Item 2 and between such persons and any persons with respect to any securities of the Issuer, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of the Shares, finder’s fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving of withholding of proxies.
