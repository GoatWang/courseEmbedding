Product Management at HubSpot








At HubSpot, product managers are the champions of the customer. They thrive at understanding the customer’s problem and working in small teams with engineers and designers to build the solution. Our PMs are data-driven, skilled communicators, and leaders within the organization driving company and customer growth. 





















































Being a PM here means you have the ability to affect thousands of customers with a single decision. That's a big responsibility but an even bigger opportunity to make an impact. The best part is that we get to make those hard decisions with such smart people that it becomes downright enjoyable.






Angela DeFranco
Product Manager













One of the best parts of my job is the amount of autonomy I experience every day. There are few things as motivating as being let loose within a product area to figure out what the most important customer issues are, and then helping your team work to solve them.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




Interior view of HubSpot's office space


HubSpot was founded by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2006.[3]
The company grew from $255,000 in revenues in 2007 to $15.6 million in 2010.[3][4] Later that year HubSpot acquired Oneforty, the Twitter app store founded by Laura Fitton.[5][6] The company also introduced new software for personalizing websites to each visitor.[7] According to Forbes, HubSpot started out targeting small companies but "moved steadily upmarket to serve larger businesses of up to 1000 employees."[8][9] HubSpot filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 25, 2014 requesting they be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HUBS.[10]
Software and services[edit]
HubSpot provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages and search engine optimization.[3][11][12][13] HubSpot has integration features for salesforce.com, SugarCRM, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and others.[14] There are also third-party services such as templates and extensions.[15] Additionally, HubSpot offers consulting services and an online resource academy for learning inbound marketing tactics.[16][17] It also hosts user group conferences and inbound marketing and certification programs.[17] HubSpot promotes their inbound marketing concepts through their own marketing[12] and has been called "a prolific creator of content" such as blogs, social media, webinars and white papers.[8]
In 2010, an article in the Harvard Business Review said that HubSpot's most effective inbound marketing feature was its free online tools.[18] One such tool, the Marketing Grader, assessed and scored website performance.[19][20] The company introduced a Twitter tracking feature in 2011.[21][22]
Tech industry reviews[edit]
HubSpot has been described as unique because it strives to provide its customers with an all-in-one approach.[13][23] A 2012 review in CRM Search said HubSpot was not the best business solution in each category but that taken as a whole it was the best "marketing solution" that combined many tools into one package.[8] It identified HubSpot's "strengths" as the sophistication of its Call to Action (CTA) tool, its online ecosystem and its "ease of use." Its weakness were described as having "more breadth than depth." The review said the lack of customization and design tools could be limiting and that it was missing advanced features such as Business Process Management (BPM) tools to manage workflow.[8]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2015, Hubspot's CMO Mike Volpe was dismissed for violating HubSpot’s code of business conduct after it was found that he tried to obtain a draft copy of the book Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start Up Bubble written by his former employee Daniel Lyons.[24][25] According to an article in the Boston Globe, records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicated that HubSpot executives considered the book "a financial threat to HubSpot" and Volpe used "tactics such as email hacking and extortion" in the attempt to prevent the book from being published.[26]
In April 2016, after releasing his book, Lyons criticized the company in a New York Times article by saying it had a "frat house" atmosphere and described it as a "digital sweatshop."[27] Later that month, HubSpot's founders gave an official response to the book, in which they addressed several, but not all of Lyons claims.[28]
Reception[edit]
The Boston Business Journal named HubSpot a "Best Place to Work in 2012."[29] In 2015, the company was named the best large company to work for in Massachusetts by the Boston Globe.[30][31]

History[edit]




Interior view of HubSpot's office space


HubSpot was founded by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2006.[3]
The company grew from $255,000 in revenues in 2007 to $15.6 million in 2010.[3][4] Later that year HubSpot acquired Oneforty, the Twitter app store founded by Laura Fitton.[5][6] The company also introduced new software for personalizing websites to each visitor.[7] According to Forbes, HubSpot started out targeting small companies but "moved steadily upmarket to serve larger businesses of up to 1000 employees."[8][9] HubSpot filed for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 25, 2014 requesting they be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HUBS.[10]
Software and services[edit]
HubSpot provides tools for social media marketing, content management, web analytics, landing pages and search engine optimization.[3][11][12][13] HubSpot has integration features for salesforce.com, SugarCRM, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and others.[14] There are also third-party services such as templates and extensions.[15] Additionally, HubSpot offers consulting services and an online resource academy for learning inbound marketing tactics.[16][17] It also hosts user group conferences and inbound marketing and certification programs.[17] HubSpot promotes their inbound marketing concepts through their own marketing[12] and has been called "a prolific creator of content" such as blogs, social media, webinars and white papers.[8]
In 2010, an article in the Harvard Business Review said that HubSpot's most effective inbound marketing feature was its free online tools.[18] One such tool, the Marketing Grader, assessed and scored website performance.[19][20] The company introduced a Twitter tracking feature in 2011.[21][22]
Tech industry reviews[edit]
HubSpot has been described as unique because it strives to provide its customers with an all-in-one approach.[13][23] A 2012 review in CRM Search said HubSpot was not the best business solution in each category but that taken as a whole it was the best "marketing solution" that combined many tools into one package.[8] It identified HubSpot's "strengths" as the sophistication of its Call to Action (CTA) tool, its online ecosystem and its "ease of use." Its weakness were described as having "more breadth than depth." The review said the lack of customization and design tools could be limiting and that it was missing advanced features such as Business Process Management (BPM) tools to manage workflow.[8]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2015, Hubspot's CMO Mike Volpe was dismissed for violating HubSpot’s code of business conduct after it was found that he tried to obtain a draft copy of the book Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start Up Bubble written by his former employee Daniel Lyons.[24][25] According to an article in the Boston Globe, records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicated that HubSpot executives considered the book "a financial threat to HubSpot" and Volpe used "tactics such as email hacking and extortion" in the attempt to prevent the book from being published.[26]
In April 2016, after releasing his book, Lyons criticized the company in a New York Times article by saying it had a "frat house" atmosphere and described it as a "digital sweatshop."[27] Later that month, HubSpot's founders gave an official response to the book, in which they addressed several, but not all of Lyons claims.[28]
Reception[edit]
The Boston Business Journal named HubSpot a "Best Place to Work in 2012."[29] In 2015, the company was named the best large company to work for in Massachusetts by the Boston Globe.[30][31]

Frequently Asked Questions















What is a user?

A user is any person who uses the software. In our pricing plan, certain types of users -- like HubSpot partners, blog authors, and sales reps -- are exempt from user-based pricing tiers, which means you can have as many of those people working with you and using the software as you like. Other types of users, like administrators and marketers, are included and calculated in your chosen pricing tier.




Do I need to buy services?

Yes. All new HubSpot Marketing Basic, Pro and Enterprise customers need to buy services to get started on the right foot with your inbound marketing efforts. Inbound marketing is about much more than just using a bunch of software to get marketing done; it’s about transforming your business to create marketing people love. That’s much easier to do in the thriving ecosystem of HubSpot customer training programs, and with the personal support of our famously passionate inbound marketing professors and consultants.




Are there any separate email sending fees?

No. HubSpot email costs are tied to the number of Contacts in your system. You can email the Contacts within your tier up to ten times per month. Since that works out to about one email every other business day, customers generally find this is more than enough. If you need to send even more than that, you can purchase more Contacts and increase your total monthly email send limit.




Do I need to pay for a year up front?

Yes. HubSpot Marketing Basic, Pro and Enterprise contracts are billed annually by default. We’ve found that customers who can commit to a full year of using HubSpot will be more successful inbound marketers in the long run. And since your long-term success is our goal, we want to encourage those practices that support that goal. Bottom line: Annual contracts make happier HubSpot customers. And we want you to be happy. 




Are there any overage fees?

Not directly - but HubSpot's pricing is designed to scale with the size of your business, so we do ask our customers to purchase a product that will fit their level of use. This means purchasing enough Contacts to match your inbound marketing needs. So while we don't charge "overage fees" as such, you should expect your database to grow over time. And you'll need to purchase enough Contacts to match that growth as it occurs.




What type of support comes with  in Marketing Basic, Pro, and Enterprise?

For Marketing Basic, Pro, and Enterprise, phone and webform support is included in your subscription fee.  This  provides a means for you to have your questions answered by HubSpot customer support specialists. Of course, users of these products are also welcome to access the HubSpot Community at community.hubspot.com.




For more information on limits that apply, see the Service Limits here.

Building Products People Love
As a product person at HubSpot, you’re part of a small, autonomous team making big things happen. Our customers publish millions of blog posts, send billions of emails, and build new websites with our software. That’s why development is driven by people, not process. If you’re an engineer, product designer, UX expert, or product manager here, you set the vision and move quickly to solve for the customer.

Our Story | HubSpot - Internet Marketing Company






































































































































            Our Story
        



























































Inbound is Everywhere
An idea in the moment has sparked a global movement.And we’re just getting started.

















The Story Behind Our Story
In 2004, we met as graduate students at MIT.While Brian was helping venture-backed startups with their go-to-market strategy, we started to notice something curious: Customers had gotten really good at blocking out interruptive marketing and sales tactics. The tried and true tactics of old (direct mail, email blasts, cold calls) simply weren’t effective anymore.





Read More
Meanwhile, Dharmesh’s blog OnStartups was seeing massive growth in traffic. We’ll admit, we were surprised. How had this tiny blog with no budget generated more traffic than companies with professional marketing teams and way bigger budgets? It felt like a modern-day David versus Goliath.
So after many meetings, even more coffee, and the occasional Belgian beer (a shared favorite of ours) we came to the simple observation: 
People don’t want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople. They want to be helped.
It was time to make the marketing and sales process human. Time to treat buyers like people, not numbers on a spreadsheet. Time to build an inbound community and help people achieve their business goals in a more personable, empathetic way.
We called it, HubSpot.
