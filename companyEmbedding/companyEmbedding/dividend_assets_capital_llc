The variety of perspectives and career horizons working together at DAC spans three generations. What we see, think and do is beyond the ability of any one point of view.
03Devotion to our investment philosophy is what makes us different.Devotion to our investment philosophy is what makes us different.The core of our philosophy is this:
Companies that declare dividends and increase those dividends substantially and  consistently, year after year, tend to perform uncommonly well; for reasons beyond dividends alone.
In order to be considered for our investment portfolios, a company must grow its dividend. It must continue to raise its dividend to remain in our investible universe.

DistanceWe’re not in it for the short-term. For a company to be considered, it must have moved in a positive direction for at least a full decade. Rising dividends are an insight into overall health.
DirectionFirst and foremost, all of the companies that we consider investing in should be gaining value by moving in a positive (upwards) direction in terms of revenues and earnings thereby gaining value.
DividendsIn addition to long-term positive growth, a company must also generate increasing dividends for its shareholders. And it must do this on a consistent basis for at least a decade.
ConsistencyA company must grow its dividend consistently for a decade to be considered for our investment portfolios. It must also continue to raise its dividends to remain in our portfolios.
CompoundingThe common stocks of the companies in which DAC invests grew their dividends at an average rate of 18.4% in 2011, and their 10-year average was 20.3%. Investment results are determined by time, not by amount invested.
Critical RoleEnergy MLPs play a critical role in providing energy to the U.S. because they own the networks of storage facilities and pipelines used to transport that energy from the refineries to the consumer.
Core StrategiesThe bases for customized portfoliosMaster Limited PartnershipEquity StrategyEquity Income StrategyMLP
Investments for our MLP Portfolios are generally Midstream Energy MLPs, offering the potential for greater diversification in an overall investment strategy than in traditional stocks and bonds. In selecting MLPs, we assess the growth of the distributions, geographic footprint, credit quality, the fundamentals of the business, and the value a business places on security.
Equity Strategy
Investments for our Equity Portfolios are selected across many industries and sectors, favoring companies in a growing global economy. While the majority are large companies, we also offer diversification among small and midsize companies. Each portfolio is constructed to help meet your objectives, which may include greater income, tax consideration, and risk tolerance.  
Equity Income Strategy
Investments for our Equity Income Portfolios are selected across many industries and sectors, including Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that offer investors the potential for higher income, distribution growth, and capital appreciation than traditional sources during environments with challenging yields. Each portfolio is constructed to help meet your objectives, which may include asset growth, greater income, tax considerations, and risk tolerance.
The Power Of DividendsDividend-paying stocks remain attractive with relatively low dividend tax rates, especially in today’s low interest environment. Through nearly every tax cycle, these stocks have generated stronger returns than the non-dividend payers in the S&P 500 Index.
46%Dividends account for 46% of the return in the S&P since 1926non-dividend paying stocks - 2.5% return since 1972dividend-paying stocks with no change in dividends - 7.3% return since 1972dividend growers - 9.9% return since 1972 (as of September 30, 2016) [Source: Further distribution prohibited without prior permission.

Behind Our Strategy““We believe that dividends are the best indicator of the future price performance of a stock. Dividends are paid when there are attractive earnings. When dividends are paid consistently and at an increasing rate over the long-term, this is likely to exert a positive movement of price performance.”
C. Troy Shaver Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer & Portfolio Manager“A company must grow its dividend consistently for a decade to be considered for our investment portfolios and must continue to raise its dividend to remain in our investible universe.
Long-term performance. Increasing value. Income generation. That’s three-dimensional wealth management.”
Anthony J. Ghoston, President, Chief Operating Officer & Chief Compliance Officer

                        02/27/12
                        
                




NEW YORK – Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM) today announced that it has launched the Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund (Class A Shares: GSRAX) following the completion of the acquisition of the mutual fund management business of Dividend Assets Capital, LLC (formerly Dividend Growth Advisors, LLC). The new offering broadens GSAM’s mutual fund platform to include a rising dividend equity strategy.
“In today’s markets, many investors are looking for ways to increase income and build long-term wealth,” said Glen Casey, Managing Director and Head of Product Strategy and Development at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “The Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund seeks to address these needs by owning companies that have the potential to grow dividends and also investing in energy Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that can provide a differentiated income stream.”
Dividend Assets Capital is the sub-adviser of the Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund. The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital and current income. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in companies that pay consistent and increasing dividends, and through an allocation to MLPs.
“We believe good companies pay dividends, but great companies grow dividends,” added Troy Shaver, Portfolio Manager of the Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund. “To us, this means the companies that consistently grow and distribute profits to shareholders demonstrate their ability to generate earnings, manage risk and appreciate in value over time.”
The Fund employs a proprietary “10/10 test” designed to identify companies that pay dividends at an increasing rate that averages approximately 10% per year over a ten-year trailing period. The Fund seeks to generate additional income through an approximate 20% allocation to MLPs, which are typically energy or infrastructure companies. Investment in energy MLPs provides capital for funding energy infrastructure development projects and may allow the Fund to capitalize on the growing US demand and discovery of energy sources and supporting infrastructure.
The Fund is sub-advised by Dividend Assets Capital’s portfolio management team, which has over six decades of dividend investing experience. The integration of the $182 million Rising Dividend Growth Fund, which had a Four-Star Overall Morningstar rating as of 1/31/12 into the Goldman Sachs fund family was approved by Dividend Assets Capital Rising Dividend Growth Fund shareholders during a shareholder meeting on February 23, 2012. The Fund is now offered in Class A and Class C shares, both with $1,000 minimum initial investments, as well as Institutional, Class R and Class IR Shares.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the asset management arm of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), which manages $821 billion as of December 31, 2011. Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been providing discretionary investment advisory services since 1988 and has investment professionals in all major financial centers around the world. The company offers investment strategies across a broad range of asset classes to institutional and individual clients globally. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals.






1As of 1/31/2012. Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Ratings: Large Blend Category - Class A Shares - Overall 4 stars out of 1576 funds, 3 Year 3 stars out of 1576 funds and 5 Year 5 stars out of 1385 funds. Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Ratings - The Overall Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating Metrics. Morningstar, Inc. is an independent publisher of mutual fund research and ratings. Ratings reflect a fund’s risk-adjusted 3-, 5, and 10-year total returns, including any sales charge.
