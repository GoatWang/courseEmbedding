Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

The Handbook of Good English By Edward D. Johnson

The Handbook of Good English By Edward D. Johnson. Now substantially revised and updated, this essential guide is arranged in an easy-to-follow, topical style that takes readers from the rules governing basic sentence structure to methods of achieving effective expression. Mr. Johnson not only explains just what is correct when it comes to devilish questions of English grammar, punctuation and usage, but also why it is correct – and even how to choose among correct alternatives. He does not bully his readers but treats them as equals who share his interest in using language well.

Description
The Handbook of Good English By Edward D. Johnson. Now substantially revised and updated, this essential guide is arranged in an easy-to-follow, topical style that takes readers from the rules governing basic sentence structure to methods of achieving effective expression. Mr. Johnson not only explains just what is correct when it comes to devilish questions of English grammar, punctuation and usage, but also why it is correct – and even how to choose among correct alternatives. He does not bully his readers but treats them as equals who share his interest in using language well.
THE HANDBOOK OF GOOD ENGLISH contains five main sections:
– Grammar – the principles that make words into sentences, with emphasis on avoiding errors
– Punctuation – comprehensive coverage from the comma to the hyphen, with emphasis on punctuating to fit sentence structure and meaning
– Miscellaneous Mechanics – proper forms for numbers, dates, titles, and other details of written English
– Diction and Composition – how to match words to the occasion, organize thoughts, avoid errors of tone, and revise effectively
– Glossary/Index – almost a book in itself, alphabetically arranged for instant solutions to the most common problems and cross-referenced to the text for broader explanations.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    The Dark Side of Good News in Biotech
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    9:29 AM ET 06/21/2017
                                                


Deal making is a staple of the biotech industry, but betting on mergers and acquisitions is much harder than it looks for investors. Fresh cancer data from Clovis Oncology (CLVS) illustrate this point. The company announced Monday that its late-stage clinical trial for cancer treatment Rubraca was a success in patients with ovarian cancer.

















                                                    Clovis Oncology stock surges 50% on positive late-stage cancer trial results
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    8:51 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


Clovis Oncology Inc. (CLVS) shares surged 50% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its late-stage trial for a cancer drug met its primary endpoint and a key secondary endpoint. Clovis said it plans to try for Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug, rucaparib, within the next four months for second line and later maintenance treatment for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who have responded to their most recent platinum therapy.

















                                                    Clovis's ovarian cancer drug set for label expansion, shares soar
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    5:46 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


* Co to apply for U.S. label expansion within 4 mths. * Shares surge more than 50 pct. * Rival Tesaro's shares slip 3 pct. By Natalie Grover. Clovis Oncology Inc (CLVS) said on Monday late-stage data on its already-approved ovarian cancer drug showed that the treatment could benefit four times as many patients, sending shares of the U.S. biotech soaring 50 percent.

















                                                    Clovis Oncology's cancer drug Rubraca succeeds in key study
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    3:56 AM ET 06/19/2017
                                                


Clovis Oncology Inc (CLVS) said its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca slowed disease progression in a late-stage trial involving patients with various gene mutations who had undergone initial therapy.

















                                                    New test may turn AZ's Lynparza into precision drug for prostate cancer
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    7:01 PM ET 06/18/2017
                                                


Scientists have developed a new three-in-one blood test that has the potential to turn AstraZeneca's (AZN) drug Lynparza into a precision medicine for prostate cancer. Lynparza, which is already approved for ovarian and recently produced good results in breast cancer, is currently in clinical development against prostate tumours.

The company said that the development meant nothing and was purely procedural. Tesaro Inc. (TSRO) shares plummeted abruptly and briefly Friday morning, dropping as much as 10.5% at the intraday low on Friday. The decline, which lasted about an hour, was prompted by recruitment for a clinical trial getting suspended.

Anatomy of a Plane Crash . . .
A few minutes past 7:00 pm., the evening of Nov. 1, 1955, a young man’s fury at having been placed in an orphanage as a child exploded in the night sky over a northern Colorado beet field. As 25 sticks of dynamite erupted in the rear baggage compartment of a DC-6B airliner en route to Portland, Oregon, 44 lives were destroyed instantly in the night sky. Eleven Minutes offers the first and only in-depth account of the crime itself, but also of the perpetrator's murder trial - a trial which posed many challenges not only to the American justice system, but to justice itself.
