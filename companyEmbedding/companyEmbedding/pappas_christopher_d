Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

about us   l   pappas history   l   pappas news and events











Chris and Harris Pappas
				The restaurant business proved a successful enterprise indeed for Jim Pappas and his father H.D. who came to America from Greece in 1897. But when the next generation came along, young Chris and Harris were encouraged to avoid the restaurant industry and given warnings about its long hours and unpredictable schedules. The brothers managed to stay away – for a little while. Harris earned a finance degree from Texas A&M University and served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. Chris received a degree in engineering from the University of Texas and took a job at IBM computers. But the lure of the restaurant biz proved too strong for both brothers. Soon, Harris found himself managing his father Jim's first restaurant, the Dot Coffee Shop, only to be followed shortly by Chris who stepped in at his brother's request. 
				
By 1976, the brothers opened their first restaurant together, The Strawberry Patch, and they have been delighting restaurant-goers ever since.  The Pappas brothers now own and operate nearly 100 restaurants in seven states. Their nine brands offer something for everyone, from fresh gulf coast seafood to Cajun-inspired cuisine, award-winning steaks, and the best Tex-Mex on planet Texas.
				
In addition to being restaurant pioneers, the Pappas Brothers are quite involved in their local community. Chris and Harris give generously of their time to the Boy Scouts of America, Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, the Boys and Girls Club and many more community associations. In short, the Pappas Brothers are just your everyday exceptional entrepreneurs of Greek descent who have made quite a name for themselves in the restaurant business or, as Harris likes to say, the "people business." Basically, they're just glad you like their food. Yes, you. And, as long as you keep liking it, they'll keep making it.

			



				The Pappas Brothers opened their first restaurant in 1976 and set out to serve only the highest quality food, fulfill their Guest's every request and make sure everyone who walked in the door felt like family. Since then, we've opened more than 100 restaurants and have become a leader in the hospitality industry. But at Pappas, it's still all about great food, impeccable service and the people who make it happen. From the truck driver who delivers only the freshest meats and seafood, to the hostess greeting Guests with a smile, to the server setting down a custom-made entrée with care, everyone at Pappas plays a role in our success. 
				
				We're a family owned and operated company, which means our core values have been passed down from generation to generation. We're constantly focused on innovation, attention to detail and quality in everything we do. Over the years, our steadfast values and top-notch team have kept prospective employees seeking us out and satisfied Guests coming back. 
			

Pappas Spirit

				The Spirit of the Pappas restaurants is embodied in our Mission Statement. It's what makes our company unique, attracts new employees and Guests and motivates our regulars to return again and again.
				

Our Goal

				To be a superior restaurant company through constant innovation, attention to detail and a focus on quality in all we do.
				

Our Guests

				We are dedicated to greeting each person who walks through our doors with warmth and friendliness. We create an outstanding dining experience through identifying and fulfilling Guest expectations.
				

Our Team

				We believe that the greatest strength of Pappas restaurants lies within our people. We are committed to providing an exciting environment that recognizes initiative and performance. We offer opportunities for growth and challenge individuals to achieve their best.
				

Our Communities

				We build relationships through participation and service and work together
				to help meet the needs of the community.

Our Family is Bigger than You Think

				One of the things that makes Pappas restaurants different is that we do more than simply run and operate our restaurants. We own and drive the trucks that deliver the freshest meats and seafood. We employ the electricians who keep the lights on and the kitchens humming. We even make our own chairs! 
				
				We own and operate almost everything we need to ensure we continue to serve the highest quality food in the exciting, comfortable environment that keeps our Guests satisfied and coming back. This type of business is called "vertical integration," and it helps us ensure there's never a holdup in the process and that we have the absolute best for our Guests the moment they ask for it.
