Skyline Medical Inc.


Investor Information





Investor Overview









Preliminary Proxy Statement (PRE 14A)




Intra
3 mo.
6 mo.
1 yr.
















	Skyline Medical Inc. has a fully automated, patented, and FDA cleared surgical fluid disposal device-the STREAMWAY System-that virtually eliminates operating room workers’ exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the surgical environment.

	Today’s manual surgical fluid handling methods of hand-carrying filled surgical fluid canisters and emptying these canisters is an exposure risk and an antiquated approach to the handling of surgical fluid waste. Skyline Medical Inc.'s STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement and disposal of surgical fluids, which results in:


		Reducing overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers

		Improving their Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other regulatory compliance

		Enhancing the efficiency of the operating room and thereby making surgeries more profitable


	Skyline Medical Inc.'s STREAMWAY System is eco-friendly as it addresses the numerous bloody, potentially disease infected canisters that go into U.S. landfills every year. These tainted canisters—which are generally made of plastic—can take centuries to biodegrade, but with installations of the STREAMWAY System, the number of these canisters can be significantly reduced.

Direct to Drain Fluid Management for Nurses & OR Technologists
























































Skyline Medical Inc.


Letter to Stockholders
Investor Information




















Nurses & Technologists






STREAMWAY Benefits for Nurses & Technologists
Safety
Through innovative, FDA-approved design, nurses and technologists can now experience greater safety than ever before. Vacuum levels are set using the digital screen before every procedure and then confirmed by the operator to ensure patient safety. The STREAMWAY® System’s direct-to-drain design eliminates waste fluid canisters and the hazards of handling medical waste. Patients also benefit from faster, nonstop procedures, reliable, continuous suction and more attention from staff.
Simple to Use
To use the wall-mounted unit, a nurse or staff member need only insert a single-use procedure filter, connect the suction tubes, set the appropriate suction level, and press start on the touchscreen. The STREAMWAY System performs uninterrupted, regardless of total fluid volumes, and it displays those volumes on a back-lit screen. Following the unit’s simple installation, on-site training is provided.
Convenient Cleanup
After each procedure, simply remove the single use procedure filter, attach the cleaning solution bottle and press the touch screen to start the automated cleaning cycle. In five minutes, the system will be ready for the next procedure. All operators of the system avoid exposure risks, because there are no fluids to handle or canisters to empty, and less time cleaning means more time for patient-focused care.
Multiple Department Applications
In addition to the Operating Room, this automated, direct-to-drain fluid management system ensures efficient procedures in various specialty areas, including: endoscopy, radiology, ultrasound and urology. With no canisters to stop and replace or to clean up, the STREAMWAY System reduces labor and enhances patient-focused care. For improved safety, the STREAMWAY System also provides programmable settings for ultrasound departments including an auto shut off feature that stops the procedure at predetermined fluid amount.  Even cleanup is simple — just set it to run the rapid clean cycle while you spend time focusing on the patient. Its small footprint is ideal for procedure rooms in small clinics and departments.

How the STREAMWAY System is Different
The STREAMWAY® System takes an innovative, environmentally friendly approach to patient and staff safety. The integrated system provides efficient and effective direct-to-drain surgical waste handling designed for surgical centers and various procedure rooms throughout hospitals. The STREAMWAY System is FDA approved.
Canister Free
Each year, approximately 50 million used surgical canisters are sent to landfills in the U.S. That also means hospitals and outpatient centers spend millions of dollars on materials and hazardous waste management. Now, your facility can save that money and engage in environmentally sound practices. Use of the STREAMWAY System saves on the cost of disposing and replacing canisters, and it eliminates risky fluid transport.
Efficient, Uninterrupted Performance
Through its sophisticated design, the STREAMWAY System promotes safer, more profitable surgical procedures. It automatically collects, measures and disposes of surgical fluids into the plumbing system without interruption. Its unlimited capacity means no waiting for canister changes, and its easy cleanup saves on labor costs.
Convenient Wall Mount
By creating a compact collection and disposal unit to fit on or recessed into the wall, the STREAMWAY System provides staff with more space to move freely around the room. Unlike other units, it does not require any storage space or floor space.

STREAMWAY Benefits for Radiology & Imaging
The FDA-approved, direct-to-drain STREAMWAY® System is revolutionizing paracentesis and thoracentesis procedures by eliminating the need for evacuated bottles and canisters. Benefits to Interventional Radiology & Imaging departments and clinics include:
Reduces Supply and Labor Costs
For most departments, the STREAMWAY System pays for itself in less than a year by eliminating the cost of evacuated bottles, canister and disposal fees. And because there are no bottles to change or transport, you save on labor costs, too.
Eliminates the Hazards of Evacuated Bottles
The self-contained design eliminates the hazards of handling potentially infectious waste fluid. It includes built-in safety features, including vacuum level reset before each patient to reduce the potential for error. You can even preset the system to remove the specific amount of fluid ordered for each patient.
Easy to Use
Set-up of the STREAMWAY System is easy. Simply insert a single-use procedure filter, connect the catheter tubing, set the appropriate suction level and press “Start” on the touchscreen. The STREAMWAY System performs uninterrupted, regardless of total fluid volumes, and displays collected volumes on a backlit screen.
Increases Procedure Efficiency
With STREAMWAY System, procedures can continue without stopping for bottle changes. The simple-start cleaning cycle – which takes less than 5 minutes – also improves turnover time between procedures, so you can treat more patients and improve profitability.
See the STREAMWAY Overview Video
