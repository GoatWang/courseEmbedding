Marchex Launches Audience Targeting for Social and Display




Solution uses call data to identify high-intent audiences for custom 
      retargeting campaigns




                    	July 20, 2017 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



SEATTLE--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Marchex 
      (Nasdaq: MCHX), a mobile advertising analytics company, today announced 
      the launch of Marchex Audience Targeting, a new solution that leverages 
      call data to automatically build high-value audience segments for 
      display and social media platforms like Facebook.
    
“The 
      power of caller-based Audience Targeting comes from giving marketers 
      another opportunity to identify prospects most likely to result in a 
      positive business outcome, whether that’s a sale or an appointment.”

      By helping brands understand who is calling, and what they’re calling 
      about, Marchex Audience Targeting empowers marketers with the ability to 
      target high intent audiences with their Facebook and display campaigns. 
      Marketers can now fine-tune campaigns down to specific audience segments 
      that are most likely to convert to customers, or find new segments and 
      opportunities that haven’t been targeted before.
    

      “Many of our customers rely on phone calls to drive appointments and 
      sales, but they don’t have an effective way to identify callers who did 
      not convert, or retarget them through popular platforms like Facebook. 
      This lack of insight makes it difficult to follow-up with prospects and 
      convert them into customers,” said Nikhil Kolar, head of product and 
      engineering. “Marchex Audience Targeting helps digital marketers go back 
      and retarget their lost callers through Facebook and display ads, 
      ensuring more prospects turn into customers.”
    

      Powered by Marchex 
      Speech Analytics and direct API integration with Facebook’s Offline 
      Conversions solution, Marchex Audience Targeting enables marketers to 
      maximize their marketing opportunities and produce custom audiences that 
      can result in new sales for the business.
    

      The release of caller-based Audience Targeting comes on the heels of 
      Marchex Speech Analytics, part of the Marchex 
      Omnichannel Analytics Cloud. Together, these three offerings create 
      a powerful portfolio of solutions for marketers, operations 
      professionals, and distributed retail professionals who need to 
      understand what media channels are driving spend to their brand, whether 
      phone calls are resulting in positive business outcomes for the company, 
      and which high-value callers to retarget.
    

      “Marketers are increasingly viewed as profit centers, responsible for 
      driving revenue,” said Guy Weismantel, EVP of marketing at Marchex. “The 
      power of caller-based Audience Targeting comes from giving marketers 
      another opportunity to identify prospects most likely to result in a 
      positive business outcome, whether that’s a sale or an appointment.”

Ad Roundup: New digital tools for marketers
In today's advertising roundup, two new releases and an expansion that should help digital marketers better connect.

by Kristina Knight

First, Marchex has launched Marches Audience Targeting; the new solution uses call data to create rich audience segmentation for both social and display advertising. The solution is powered by Marches Speech Analytics.
"Many of our customers rely on phone calls to drive appointments and sales, but they don't have an effective way to identify callers who did not convert, or retarget them through popular platforms like Facebook. This lack of insight makes it difficult to follow-up with prospects and convert them into customers," said Nikhil Kolar, head of product and engineering, Marchex. "Marchex Audience Targeting helps digital marketers go back and retarget their lost callers through Facebook and display ads, ensuring more prospects turn into customers."
Meanwhile, Verint is releasing Knowledge Management Professional, a solution geared toward simplifying how consumers and sales professionals share information.
"We're delighted to offer an enterprise-class knowledge solution to such a wide range of organizations," says John Goodson, SVP and general manager, Customer Engagement Solutions™, Verint. "As more and more organizations prioritize knowledge management--and as they empower customers to self-serve and employees to access the most current information with ease and confidence in real time--we believe solutions like Verint Knowledge Management Professional will be attractive based on solution impact, customer and employee engagement, and cost and time to value."
And MobAir has announced plans to open an office in India; the move should help brands communicate more effectively with consumers and other businesses there. 
"Unlike Europe and the US, the e-commerce vertical in India has its own peculiarities that we need to take into account for growing business in the area," said Vijay Singh. "Our task is to apply prior expertise in the field and smoothly adapt it to the local advertising industry, helping mobile brands monetize their content in the easiest, fastest user-friendly way."

I have employed the services of Marchex in the last three companies to track, measure and prove usage in various advertising formats.  We have also sued the Marchex Tracking Numbers to measure responses to our own advertising.  The reports are detailed, visual and simple to understand.What do you dislike?Many report options but no way I can see to template a report for quick access.Recommendations to others considering the productI tried many, always come back to Marchex!  Best value, reports, options and reliability!  The ability to show the DNA of every call to a customer not only elimiantes any question of performance of the ad, it sets us up as reliable and provable providers of advertising!  Providing analytics for a digital advertising placement is great, everyone can do that.  But providing the actual call DNA including a recording of the actual call knocks it out of the park!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Proving usage of both print and digital advertising with detail and third party credibility gives us an edge that dominates our competition!Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernAre you a current user of Marchex?YesNoWhat Inbound Call Tracking solution do you use?CallRailCallTrackingMetricsDialogTechInvocaNinjaCatCall BoxActiveDEMANDConvirza (formerly LogMyCalls)RetreaverRingDNATelmetricsCalltracksI don't use Inbound Call Tracking softwareJordan F.Review SourceJordan F.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceSolid Services + Measurable Results = More Profit for My AgencyUpdated On April  5, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?The ability to clearly show a client what is working and provide them an ROI/cost of acquisition per channel. What do you dislike?Nothing. The customer service is stellar and easy to understand. Recommendations to others considering the productIf you need a simple, proven way to substantiate your marketing efforts are working on behalf of the service-oriented or direct response client, I can think of no better way than Marchex's phone tracking. We also use it to evaluate calls and do training to improve conversions. Many times a CEO or company manager is very surprised to listen to how his or her call center or call receivers are handling calls. Of course, if the call is answered in a great fashion, it gives him or her the opportunity to celebrate the employee!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?The ability to answer anytime a client asks, What is the campaign or media channel really doing for us?Read MoreShare on10 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernOzzy G.Review SourceOzzy G.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceReview of Marchex Call AnalyticsUpdated On November 19, 2015Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?The customer service. Every time I have a question or concern, the representatives are always courteous and eager to help. I also like the ability to add clients as users.  I find the call recording feature to be particularly useful with my ecommerce clients to track offline conversion value.What do you dislike?The UI is a little clunky. Also, in the call logs, the setting time in the reports is a little tedious. I also find setting up rewrites to be less than intuitive. There are a lot of steps. Finally, setting business hours should have some cascading options.  Recommendations to others considering the productIf it's possible to make code implementation easier, that would help. I have found several times that the number changer doesn't play nice with Google Tag Manager. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We are a step closer to proving offline value to our clients. The benefits of call tracking through Marchex help me prove to clients the value our paid search efforts are having beyond tracking conversions.

They're respond to emails within a few hours and can always get someone on the phone right away, if needed, to answer a quick question about a feature, look into an issue, or get a phone number ordered. What do you dislike?I've occasionally have had a problem for a client (based around the connection time for a call to connect to their office phone) that has not been resolved. All arrows point to Marchex but a solution has yet to be found. They've checked multiple times for me and have seen nothing wrong. Recommendations to others considering the productGive Marchex a try! It's a great program with great customer service to help you out any way they can. The only thing I'd be weary of is using the whisper files as we've had multiple issues with them over several different clients.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?I'm able to give my clients tangible results with the exact number of calls coming in through specific tracking numbers. Marchex has great reporting features that show days of the week and times the calls are coming in. I can also show my clients the number of calls NOT being answered and the potential business they're losing. VERY helpful tool for our company.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as MarchexReport a ConcernGerry G.Review SourceGerry G.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceTracking Lets Us Document Our ResultsUpdated On November 17, 2015Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?At Advice Company and AdviceCo Ventures Company we like to do more than just deliver the results we promise -- we like to be able to demonstrate that we do.  Marchex allows us to do just that and document how many phone calls a listing on our AttorneyPages.com and ExpertPages.com sites generate, and thus create irrefutable proof of effectiveness. What do you dislike?Nothing good comes free, and there is a cost to using Marchex. The only difficulty we sometimes run into is when a client changes his or her phone number on our system, without notifying us so that we can redirect the Marchex Toll Free Line to the client's new number.What business problems are you solving with the product?

The Marchex Reputation Management product is an extension of the award-winning Marchex Connect platform, which supports hundreds of thousands of marketing campaigns for local advertisers.
According to a new BIA/Kelsey local advertising forecast, the E-mail,
Reputation and Presence Management (ERPM) category is expected to grow from $460 million in 2008 to $3.1 billion in 2013. Additionally, the number of SMBs using ERPM will increase from approximately 500,000 to nearly 4 million during the forecast period. As user-generated reviews continue to become more prevalent with consumers, local businesses are seeking ways to leverage this opportunity to ensure their online reputations are kept intact and enhanced. Marchex Reputation Management is intended to give SMBs an information advantage, allowing them to manage their online reputations with a level of detail not previously available in the market.
“SMBs are the heart of local, yet these businesses have yet to find a
cost-effective solution that leverages technology to comprehensively manage their reputations,” said Matt Booth, senior vice president and program director, Interactive Local Media, BIA/Kelsey. “Marchex is well positioned in the ERPM market to help SMBs save valuable time and also improve their online marketing efforts.”
Online Business Intelligence
Marchex Reputation Management was built using proprietary local search technology from Marchex’s Open List local search network. Covering more than 8,000 sources and currently containing more than a quarter billion pieces of meta-data, Marchex Reputation Management monitors and reports on a specific business’ online footprint, including its user reviews and news, blog and social media mentions. In addition, Marchex Reputation Management ensures the accuracy of information in existing online business listings found on general search sites, local search sites and directories, such as consistent business name, address and phone numbers, as well as making recommendations as to where to add new listings for more coverage.  This information is
refreshed daily.
Marchex Reputation Management blends Marchex’s heritage in local search with its proven ability to partner and deliver local advertising solutions.
Specific features include:
–          Reviews: Charts break out the percentage of positive, neutral or negative reviews in an easy-to-read display.
–          Mentions: Charts demonstrate activity by reviews or mentions to tie the information back to particular changes in the business or marketing efforts by month.
–          Business listings: Ensure business listings are accurate and
visible on top online consumer destinations.
–          Keyword identification: Top keywords and phrases are highlighted to identify the terms that differentiate the business and act as an alert to any customer service issues.
–          Competitive marketing analysis: Compare a business to other local businesses to analyze how its reputation and marketing efforts stack up.
–          Ability to engage: Share positive news and reviews with customers and employees through email, Twitter, Facebook, Digg or other sources.
“Local search is a solved consumer problem but it’s not yet a solved SMB problem. By applying our local search technology in an innovative way, we can consistently deliver an aggregated, intelligent view to an SMB of how it is viewed by local consumers,” said Pete Christothoulou, COO, Marchex. “Our Reputation Management product is the most simple, comprehensive and effective way for SMBs to manage and take action on their reputation.  We are providing them a huge information advantage while saving them valuable time from searching multiple Web sites to see what consumers are saying about them or checking every search engine or directory to ensure that their business listings are in every appropriate place.”
Complement to Marchex Products
Marchex Reputation Management is the first major extension of the Marchex Connect suite of SMB marketing products, expanding the Marchex Connect footprint from full service search engine marketing (SEM) provider to full service SEM complemented by sentiment analytics.
Pricing and Availability
Marchex Reputation Management will be available to a limited number of local businesses during the beta period, which will conclude in Q1 2010. Businesses interested in learning more about Marchex Reputation Management, or trying out the product as part of the beta program can visit: www.marchex.com/repmanagement   .
Once the beta period has concluded, Marchex will offer this product through select Marchex Connect reseller partners who typically have large installed bases of SMB end customers.  Pricing to SMBs will be a subscription-based model and will vary depending on how the product is bundled with other offerings.

Marchex Launches New Speech Analytics Product, Providing Actionable Intelligence From Within The Phone Call






Business Wire




Apr 27, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Marchex (NASDAQ: MCHX), a mobile advertising analytics company, today announced the launch of Marchex Speech Analytics, a new solution that enables actionable insights for enterprise and mid-sized companies, helping them understand what is happening on inbound phone calls from consumers to their business. Uncovering the intelligence and insights of these consumer calls can empower companies to optimize media spend and sales operations, driving more high quality calls to their business and creating the opportunity to successfully convert more of those callers into customers.  The launch of Marchex Speech Analytics follows the recent release of Marchex's Omnichannel Analytics Cloud solution in February, enabling marketers to identify which digital channels are driving inbound phone calls, and informing marketers how media spend should be allocated across site, search, social media, display and video accordingly. With the addition of Speech Analytics to Marchex's product suite, marketers and call center teams can gain a deeper understanding of the customer experience by gathering data from calls, at scale, from beginning to end. Marchex Speech Analytics helps telesales teams obtain insights into phone conversations in ways that professionals were previously unavailable.  "Using Marchex Speech Analytics, and specifically the Lost Opportunities Dashboard feature, we are able to quickly identify what areas of our marketing are working," said Caleb Williams, Marketing Innovation Manager at TWO MEN AND A TRUCK®. "These same tools allow us to more efficiently coach and train our sales and operations staff to meet our customer's expectations. In short, Marchex Speech Analytics enables better phone leads with increased opportunity for conversion."  Marchex Speech Analytics leverages the company's state of the art, patent pending speech recognition and Call DNA® technology to aggregate and analyze call data. Marchex Speech Analytics includes innovative new dashboards and visual analytics to make it easier for telesales teams to discern actionable insights. While call analytics solutions have historically relied on raw data and log files that marketers must manually categorize and interpret, the data visualization features of Speech Analytics empower businesses to quickly identify opportunities for retargeting, and recognize areas for improvement. Specifically, the Marchex Speech Analytics dashboards quantify key, value added elements such as lost opportunities, high intent calls, agent script tracking, and searchable transcripts.
