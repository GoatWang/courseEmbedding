Frank, I just learned about your Dad. We used to exchange Christmas cards until a few years ago. I sent card to his last address which I believe was 6555 Dan Danciger Rd in Fort Worth. It has been so long since I saw him. I did see Frances with Andrew Yacenda in NY about 15 or so years ago. I wonder who got the 8 mm films I sent back to your Mom.
I"m living here in Indianapolis for 54

Frank, I just learned about your Dad.  We used to exchange Christmas cards until a few years ago.  I sent card to his last address which I believe was 6555 Dan Danciger Rd in Fort Worth.  It has been so long since I saw him.  I did see Frances with Andrew Yacenda in NY about 15 or so years ago.  I wonder who got the 8 mm films I sent back to your Mom.
I"m living here in Indianapolis for 54 years now and am getting along at my age (76-1/2)
Feel free to write me at my e-mail address.  
So sorry to hear about  Dad.  Last I knew he was working in Santa Monica and got to see Stan Laurel of Laurel & Hardy.
Hope to hearfrom you.
Phil
