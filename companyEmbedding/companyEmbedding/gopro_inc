History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]

Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.

However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

	GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Was Just Another One-Hit Wonder
The CEO remains optimistic, but GPRO is lacking any compelling, marketable products

Last month, GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) CEO Nick Woodman was interviewed by CNBC. Though it’s certainly old news by now, it’s worth revisiting… not because it was compelling, but because, in retrospect, it was alarming to current and would-be owners of GPRO stock. In short, Woodman is still trying to sell the premise to investors, even though he’s no longer able to sell the company’s hardware to consumers.

Sure, there will always be some sort of market for action cameras, and if nothing else, GoPro is the most recognizable name in the business.
That’s just not enough, though. Whether Woodman wants to see it or not, there’s just not much of a future for GoPro.
No Encore
Giving credit where it’s due, Nick Woodman made a good point, sort of. That is, he said investors should focus on the company’s fifteen-year history rather than the past year and a half of troubled results.
There’s a flipside to that coin, though. That is, the company’s earliest non-IPO investors who bought into the hype — anywhere between $28.65-$98.47 — shortly after its 2014 IPO are now down between 71%-91% on their positions. It’s a little tough to take solace in the company’s long-term existence when you’re that deep in the red after believing the pre-IPO hype Woodman had mustered. We didn’t hear that same long-term sermon in the months leading up to the initial public offering for GPRO stock.
To that end, while Woodman wants the market to focus on the bigger picture, he may not realize that in some regard that’s exactly what it’s doing. Investors are looking for the next big growth engine from GoPro, but there simply doesn’t seem to be one. The Karma drone was supposed to be it, but it wasn’t. The VR-filming Odyssey rig was ballyhooed, but didn’t mean much in the way of revenue. GoPro spent hundreds of millions of dollars to become a media venue, but it never panned out.
So, why would investors expect the future to be any different than the past? GoPro was a one-hit wonder, plain and simple.
Reality Check
It’s time to talk tough truths… Woodman was passionate about the premise, and investors fell in love with the idea of a high-quality action camera. They were so blinded by that love, in fact, that they didn’t ask any of the right questions.
The one glaring one they didn’t ask: What’s the plausible, sustainable market for action cameras, regardless of where and how they’re mounted? As it turns out, while most everyone respects the fact that GoPro makes great action cameras, most everyone doesn’t actually want to buy one. And, even the photographers and videographers who buy one don’t necessarily want another one.
It’s just not a mass market product. It never was.
The close-second question most early owners of GPRO stock didn’t ask: What’s the plan to stave off the competition that would inevitably rise?
There wasn’t one. Nobody cares, though. Traders were too enamored by the hype.

		Will The New Products Help GoPro Stock? - GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO)

GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) stock is facing strong resistance from the 100-day moving average line.

After reporting better than expected revenue growth in Q1, action camera maker GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) is on track to achieve its Q2 targets, according to CEO Nick Woodman. GoPro is in the middle of a turnaround process which has not borne the desired results till now, though there has been some progress. The company has taken several steps including restructuring and product diversification. However, the company is not out of the woods yet. GoPro's Hero line of cameras still command strong customer loyalty. Hero cameras are one of the best in their class. According to The NPD Group's Retail Tracking Service, Hero camera's occupied top three spots in the digital image category in the United States. But that has not helped the company or the stock much in the past two years. GPRO stock is down 84% in the last two years and almost flat YTD.    



What is holding down GoPro Inc?
There are several reasons for GoPro's struggles. While GoPro's cameras are of high quality, it serves a very niche market. There are now indications that the niche action camera market may be saturating. And improving camera quality in mobile phones such as the iPhone and Galaxy Note will make wider adoption of GoPro's Hero line of cameras difficult. Apart from the niche market, GoPro is also facing strong competition from much cheaper action cameras. While the competitors may not be able to match GoPro's quality, they provide the same functionality at a much cheaper price.  


  
Then there is also the execution problem. Last holiday season, GoPro managed to botch the release of its much-awaited Hero 5 line of Cameras as well as the Karma drone. Manufacturing issues led to delay in the delivery of Hero 5 Black camera during the all-important holiday season. More importantly, GoPro was forced to recall its much-hyped Karma drones due to technical issues. The recall was announced after GoPro discovered that Karma drones were prone to crashing mid-flight due to a sudden loss of power. The recall did a great damage to GoPro's brand name. And this was not the first big launch which GoPro had flubbed. Even Hero 4 launch didn't go as planned. GoPro was forced to slash its price within few months of the launch and take a hit of millions of dollars in inventory write-downs.  
Product diversification.
While action cameras remain GoPro's main revenue source, the company has been diversifying into other product markets. Apart from the Karma drone, GoPro has also launched subscription service for photo and video editing and sharing. Diversification will help to increase GoPro's total addressable market and reduce the business risk. However, both Karma and the subscription service didn't have a perfect start. The recall of Karma during the all-important holiday season was a big blow to the brand and the timing didn't help either. Given the negative brand image and strong competition from Chinese drone manufacturer DJI, GoPro will have to invest significant time and money in the drone to make it appeal to customers once again. Karma drone lacked several features such as "collision avoidance" and "follow me", which are now staple features in most of the drones.    



Further, the action camera company announced the pilot launch of Fusion 5.2K spherical camera. Fusion is a 360-degree spherical camera that's supposed to allow you to reframe images in 2D shots and see full-field of view in VR. VR is a rapidly growing market which could be a big opportunity for GoPro. According to statista.com, VR hardware market is expected to grow from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $15.9 billion in 2020. While Karma was diversification into an industry in which GoPro didn't have much experience, Fusion is a perfect example of product extension in GoPro's core business in which the company has considerable expertise.  


  
GoPro stock remains a risky bet.
GoPro's recent launches have failed to live up to their promise till now. With the growth in action camera market slowing down, GoPro needs another product to drive its growth. The company's decision to enter the VR market through Fusion camera is a good move, though it might be some time before it has any impact on GoPro's top line. Given the challenges, GoPro stock remains a risky long-term bet.

GoPro, Inc.'s Best Product(s) in 2015
Hint: GoPro's saving grace wasn't even launched this year.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Dec 31, 2015 at 9:00AM
            
            





With shares of GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) down more than 70% in 2015, it seems an understatement to say the action-camera specialist has had a terrible year.
GoPro has struggled over the past several months as new products like its HERO4 Session fell flat. More specifically, the tiny new camera suffered weak sell-through from the time it launched in July, prompting the company to effectively cut its price in half through two price reductions since then. Consequently, the fallout of this failure was more than enough for me to name the HERO4 Session GoPro's single worst product in 2015.
However, that's not to say everything went wrong for GoPro this year. In fact, things appeared to be looking up for GoPro up until the middle of August, helped by a huge rally after it repeatedly crushed analysts' estimates for both revenue and earnings in its first and second quarters to start the year.
All the while, two products have stood out as the primary forces driving GoPro's business: The HERO4 Black and HERO4 Silver cameras:

GoPro's HERO4 Black (left) and HERO4 Silver (right) have propped up overall sales since their late-2014 launch. Image source: GoPro,





The HERO4 Black and HERO4 Silver stand tall as GoPro's most expensive -- and highest-margin -- cameras at $499 and $399, respectively. And unlike the HERO4 Session, GoPro's Black and Silver models have successfully maintained those steep prices since launching over a year ago in September 2014.
GoPro doesn't provide an exact breakdown of per-model sales, so we can't accurately determine which model has had a greater influence on GoPro's overall results. Rather, GoPro management almost always refers to both products together in the same sentence, and has confirmed the HERO4 Black and Silver have collectively represented more than 50% of the company's total revenue and unit sales every quarter since their launch.
Consequently, GoPro's gross margin has consistently come in higher than expected thanks to Black and Silver's outsized contributions. Despite GoPro's struggles last quarter on the HERO4 Session's weakness, for example, Q3 gross margin came in at a solid 46.8%, well above GoPro's guidance for 46%. And even as sales are expected to decline 17% year over year in the current holiday quarter, HERO4 Black and Silver should continue to be the largest contributors to revenue. In turn, GoPro says, this should drive gross margin of roughly 46% in Q4, well above the company's long-term goal of maintaining a range of 42% to 44%.
Of course, having these year-old products still driving the majority of sales isn't exactly ideal, as you can bet GoPro would rather have enjoyed complementary strength from its much newer HERO4 Session at its original higher price. To be sure, I've already voiced concerns that the HERO4 Session's latest price decrease might signal trouble in the near term, especially as the market grows more impatient waiting for new high-end GoPro cameras to hit the market and replicate Black and Silver's success.





But in the meantime -- for better or worse -- given their crucial role in propping up GoPro's business, I think the HERO4 Black and Silver have easily earned the joint title of GoPro's best product in 2015.

GoPro Official Website - Capture + share your world - About Us















About Us
GoPro makes the world's most versatile cameras.


A letter from our Founder and CEO
Think it. See it. Do it.
We dream. We have passionate ideas about what’s possible in this world. Our passions lead us to create experiences and realities that expand our world and inspire those around us.
GoPro helps people capture and share their lives’ most meaningful experiences with others—to celebrate them together. Like how a day on the mountain with friends is more meaningful than one spent alone, the sharing of our collective experiences makes our lives more fun.
The world’s most versatile cameras are what we make.
Enabling you to share your life through incredible photos and videos is what we do.
This is your life...GoPro.
Nicholas Woodman

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]


Play media


a timelapse recording one frame every 10 seconds with a GoPro HERO3 camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in Chicago. Note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images.


In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]
GoPro Omni[edit]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
