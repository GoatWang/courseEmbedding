Overview of OLD MUTUAL UK SPECIALIST EQUITY F GBP

Buy in ISA
Buy in Investment Account




A Dublin registered OEIC offering exposure to a market neutral equity strategy by taking long and short positions primarily in UK equities outside the FTSE 100 Index. The strategy is a mirror version of an existing Cayman listed fund launched in 2003 and is designed to target absolute returns with low levels of volatility. Old Mutual have one the City's largest and most experienced UK small and mid cap team, the resulting portfolio is very much the result of output from across the team.

				Before investing make sure you have understood the risks relevant to the fund by reviewing our Risk Warnings section.  Further information on the risks are contained in the fund's Key Investor Information Document, which we make available to you before you make a decision to invest, alternatively it is available on request.
			




Bestinvest view

Given the combination of team experience, and the increasingly limited / poor quality of sell side coverage in UK small and mid cap universe we believe the new UCITs version of this strategy should have a high probability of maintaining the track record set by its original Cayman listed fund.

Investment process

Both long and short ideas are the result of collaboration across the OMAM UK  small / mid cap team - it is the responsibility of all analysts to come up with long and short ideas from their respective sectors. Long positions focus on positive earnings revisions and re-rating potential, shorts the opposite. Stocks are rarely shorted on the basis of valuation alone. The fund generally has  a gross exposure of 200%, evenly balanced between long and short positions. Net exposures having rarely been outside of  +/-4% range. The team don’t tend to dynamically manage the gross exposure according to the market backdrop, given that it is virtually market neutral, and expect to generate alpha ideas in most market conditions. Generally there are no pair trades. Historically the fund has tended to display thematic tilts, these are not specifically targeted but tend to evolve. Weightings to themes are monitored to ensure the fund is not too vulnerable to market reversals / factor risks.

Joined Old Mutual in 2007 working originally as an analyst before promotion to deputy fund manager alongside Richard Watts on a segregated small / mid cap mandate in 2010,  subsequently promoted to lead in 2012.

Track record

The track record of Tim Service in managing mutual funds in this sector is still too short for us to draw any meaningful conclusions and so our assessment is based largely on qualitative aspects.

About the MRI

					Our unique indicator: the Bestinvest Manager Record Index (MRI)
					measures the likelihood that the fund manager is adding value through their decisions.
					It is based on their performance record over the course of their career, adjusted
					for the amount of risk taken. MRI is an important contributor to our fund rating
					system but it is also vital to take account of qualitative factors. It is also very
					important to select funds to form a cohesive portfolio with an appropriate overall
					risk level.

This website contains information on a large number of investment funds which are registered and managed in different jurisdictions. Access to the information contained on this website may be restricted by laws and regulations applicable to you as a user. Truthfully stating your domicile is a mandatory requirement for using this website.
        
This information is not intended for you if you are bound by laws or regulations which prohibit the publication of or access to the information in question by virtue of your nationality, your place of residence or on other grounds. If you are subject to such restrictions, you are not permitted to access this information.
        
An investment in the funds described on this website should be made only after careful study of the most recent sales prospectus and the basic legal information, risks, tax aspects and any offering restrictions and other conditions contained therein. Sales prospectuses, key investor information document (KIID), where available, and annual and semiannual reports may be obtained free of charge from the Credit Suisse branch responsible.
        
According to the UCITS Directive 2009/65/EC, investors shall be provided with a key investor information document (KIID) before subscription to a UCITS fund. KIID is provided on the website of the respective investment company or management company or, where available, on this Fund Lab website, "Documents". You herewith specifically consent to the provision of KIID in that form.
        
Every investment involves risk, especially with regard to fluctuations in value and return, up to a total loss of the amount invested. Historical returns and financial market scenarios are no guarantee of current or future performance. Information on investment fund returns may be stated in a currency other than that of your domicile; accordingly exchange-rate fluctuations should be taken into account.
        
Transactions in investment products are subject to tax laws and provisions under various legal jurisdictions: e.g. in the legal jurisdiction in which the investment products are issued or in which the issuer is domiciled; in the legal jurisdictions in which the investment products have invested; in the legal jurisdictions in which these investment products are held in the safekeeping accounts of investors; in the legal jurisdiction in which the investors are domiciled or resident or are subject to tax obligations.        Potential investors are personally responsible for informing themselves about the applicable tax laws and provisions and for complying with them in connection with the subscription, purchase, holding, sale, redemption or distribution of investments. Statements about transactions in investment products may not be construed as tax advice on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. It is recommended that investors carefully consider the potential tax consequences of such investments, as needed with the assistance of a tax advisor, and compare them with the tax consequences of investing in other products. It is also important to note that investors must still themselves compile and/or supplement the data for the calculation of taxes even where such data has been automatically prepared on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. 
        
Units of investment funds of Credit Suisse Group AG's three fund platforms (Switzerland and Liechtenstein) and CS funds that are managed in Germany by SGSS Deutschland Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or any of its territories. Units of these investment funds may not be offered, sold or delivered to US citizens or persons resident or incorporated in the US and/or other natural or legal persons whose income and/or returns, regardless of origin, are subject to US income tax, as well as persons who are considered to be US persons pursuant to Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and/or the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, in each case as amended from time to time.
The information on investment funds provided on this website does not represent an offer or a recommendation to enter into a transaction of any kind.

It is recommended that investors carefully consider the potential tax consequences of such investments, as needed with the assistance of a tax advisor, and compare them with the tax consequences of investing in other products.

UK Hedged Equity Fund (DXPS) | ETFs from WisdomTree





































































                            London is a major financial center within Europe so, understandably, many of the world's leading companies list their stocks there—even if they are physically headquartered elsewhere. In our opinion, these companies can be extremely attractive investments—but is the British pound? The WisdomTree United Kingdom Hedged Equity Fund, DXPS, offers you a way to capitalize on the growth potential of leading global companies, while hedging exposure to the British pound.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

										     There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The Fund focuses its investments in the United Kingdom, thereby increasing the impact of events and developments in the United Kingdom that can adversely affect performance. Investments in currency involve additional special risks, such as credit risk, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investments which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. As this Fund can have a high concentration in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Fund's prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund's risk profile.

WHAT IS CURRENCY HEDGING?


International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. While currency can sometimes push equity returns higher, it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty.
 

Currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange (FX) risk on international investments returns. Popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts, spot contracts, and foreign currency options.
 
At WisdomTree, we have been implementing currency-hedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more cost-effective1 than many investors expect. The bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets.


MECHANICS OF THE CURRENCY HEDGE


Here is how currency hedging typically works at WisdomTree:





 
The WisdomTree Currency Hedged Equity family of Funds implements WisdomTree’s currency-hedging strategies by entering into one-month forward contracts each month and rebalancing at month-end.

WHY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES?
 
Investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency. This risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth. This “currency bet,” as some might call it, can help increase total returns during periods when the euro, yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar.

But it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value. We believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency.



When it comes to hedging foreign currencies, there are several myths out there. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
 
MYTH #1


It is expensive to hedge foreign currencies.


Typically, it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher short-term interest rates than the United States, as is the case in Brazil, for example. However, the euro, yen and British pound—which combine to represent almost three-quarters of the weight of the MSCI EAFE Index (a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of 21 developed countries in Europe, Australasia and Japan) —each has a very low cost to hedge, as figure 1 shows. In addition, as U.S. rates rise relative to rates in Europe and Japan, dollar-based investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure. Put another way, it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure.

MYTH #2


Euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.


The values of the euro and yen, in essence, do not make good hedges against U.S. inflation rates or declining U.S. dollar purchasing power. What does make a potentially good hedge against inflation? We believe that stocks representing claims on real assets and/or those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation. As figure 2 shows, dividend growth on the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—CPI in periods of high inflation, while currency returns did not.
 

 
MYTH #3


Currency returns are a wash in the long run.


One of the arguments we hear often is that, due to a concept called purchasing power parity (PPP), currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash. Yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends. Interestingly, international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends (as shown in figures 3A and 3B). And when the currency is down, that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure.

STRATEGIC & TACTICAL HEDGING
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged. And some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency.



Additionally, currency exposure can offer an added risk with little (or no) positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk.” Although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing, it doesn’t have to be.

 
For investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally, those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen, currency hedging is an important option, as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness.
STRATEGIC HEDGING FOR THE LONG TERM
When investing for the long term, it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question. In fact, as figure 4 shows, over the short and long term, currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments. And over the long term shown below, hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the S&P 500.


TACTICAL HEDGING FOR SHORT-TERM ALLOCATIONS
Currency can make a big difference—even in the short term. In the Abenomics period starting November 30, 2012 and ending September 30, 2016, the MSCI Japan Index returned 44.4%—a decent return until it is compared to the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index, which achieved a 61.7% return over the same timeframe! The difference? The WisdomTree Index hedges the yen, which lost 18.6% over the same period, while the MSCI index does not.



 
And there were similar results throughout Europe, where the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index returned 16.1%, while the MSCI EMU Index lost 9.7% and the euro lost 18.2%.





 
WHY HEDGE DYNAMICALLY?
 
Historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short- and long-term holding periods. While currency hedging has obvious advantages, some investors may not want the challenge of timing U.S. dollar strength or weakness. Building on our expertise in currency hedging, WisdomTree pioneered dynamic currency hedging, an adaptive strategy suited for long-term investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings.
 
Problem Solving
 

Many leave it to their active manager to make the hedge/no hedge decision, but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection, not currencies
Dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to "time" when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core, long-run allocation 
Dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions

 
How Is It Achieved?
 

WisdomTree partnered with Record Currency Management, a currency manager with over 30 years of experience, to determine hedging signals for the new Index family1
Targeting Profitable Hedges: The strategy targets mid to long-term excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses
Diversification by Signal Time Horizon: Signals used to determine hedges (interest rates , value, momentum) have diversification in time horizon efficacy

EUROPE & INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS

 
International investments should have a place in every portfolio, and now may be an opportune time to add them.
 

Of course, we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the U.S. dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats, we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar. And if the dollar is rising, other currencies are often weakening. Hedging them can help to reduce volatility.



EUROPE HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 
The European Central Bank’s recent monetary easing policies have helped our Europe Hedged Equity family perform well. Not only are many of the world's leading companies—and familiar brands—headquartered in Europe, but these are truly global companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from exporting to countries outside Europe. Our family of European Hedged Equity Funds offers investors a way to more fully access the return potential of European equities while hedging the effects of the currencies.

GERMANY HEDGED EQUITY FUND

Germany is one of the engines of European growth. It has been a resilient force throughout the debt crisis and should benefit if a broader European recovery can take hold. Even so, we think some of the best times to own German stocks have been when Germany’s currency has been declining. WisdomTree Germany Hedged Equity Fund (DXGE) offers investors a way to capitalize on the growth potential of the tremendous German exporters while hedging out the effects of the euro, helping reduce volatility and capturing the performance of these stocks as their revenues potentially increase in a depreciating euro environment.

JAPAN & KOREA CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS
 
Asian investments can be a smart addition to a portfolio. And now may be an opportune time to add Japan and Korea, as these countries are both undergoing exciting changes.
 

However, history has shown that in export-driven economies, the equities typically go up when the currency is going down. And this can erode investors’ returns. Hedging the yen and the won can help reduce volatility.



JAPAN HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 

The Land of the Rising Sun is home to what we believe are exciting investment opportunities. And as prime minister Shinzo Abe continues to make strides with his economic policies, known a “Abenomics,” we expect that the economy as a whole and many sectors will benefit. Our family of Japan Hedged Equity Funds—which has enjoyed success with the new economic policies—offers a way to access the return potential of Japanese equities while hedging the effects of the yen.

        Last year, one of the most important investment themes was currency hedging, particularly for euro-denominated stocks. Many investors believed the euro was going to weaken on the back of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB)—and that’s exactly what happened. Versus the U.S. dollar, the euro started 2015 at 1.21 and closed the year at 1.09. With such a big move, many investors are wondering if they missed the boat.    
From our perspective, to the contrary. The case to hedge the euro has gotten stronger by one very important measure: how much you are now being paid to hedge.  
 
An important element of currency-hedged strategies involves the use of forward contracts to neutralize currency exposure. The pricing of these forward contracts is based on relative interest rate   differentials. In some countries like Brazil, short-term interest rates are very high, so it can cost U.S. investors upward of 14% per year to hedge exposure to currencies like the Brazilian real. That creates an incredibly high hurdle for how much the currency has to decline before an investor breaks even on paying that hedge cost.  
 
But the actions the ECB took in December 2015 make hedging the euro different. The ECB took its deposit rate more negative—cutting rates to -30 basis points (bps). The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)   hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years and now has a band on its short-term rate of 25–50 bps; the midpoint of the range would be 37.5 bps. This means currency hedging is not only inexpensive—investors are actually getting paid to hedge the euro. And if/when the Fed increases rates in 2016, that “payment” will increase further.  
 
Historical Cost of Hedging the Euro (1-Month Currency Forward Implied Rates as of 12/31/15)

From a tactical perspective, when we look at what factors can help improve the returns from a purely passive hedging standpoint, interest rate differentials are the most powerful long-run signal. Given that an investor is starting to get paid more than 50 basis points a year from the differential in interest rates, this offers a boost to returns to hedged strategies over unhedged strategies, even if the euro does not move.  
Of course, if the euro appreciates, the hedged strategies will not participate in those gains, but they will be hedged against further losses in the euro if those were to occur.  
 
WisdomTree has three exchange-traded fund (ETF) options to target euro-area stocks with a currency hedge: 
 
1)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF (HEDJ): Provides access to the dividend-paying exporters of Europe, which can be positioned to benefit from a decline in the euro with their goods becoming more competitively priced in the global markets. We believe these companies have not fully benefited from the fall in the euro yet, as many of them also have large amounts of business coming from the emerging markets, which have also been weak in the last year. This is our flagship ETF for euro-area-hedging strategies.  
 
2)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged SmallCap Equity ETF (EUSC): Provides access to small-cap companies of the euro area and offers exposure to a more local side of European stocks. This fund can pair nicely with the large-cap multinationals to diversify size exposure and geographic revenue mixes of the companies.  
 
3)	WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged Europe Equity ETF (DDEZ): Provides access to a broad cross-section of dividend payers from the euro area and implies a dynamic currency hedge. For investors who do not want to rotate between hedged and unhedged strategies, but want to have some currency exposure when the environment is supportive of it, this fund can adapt and provide that type of tactical hedging solution.  
 

    




Important Risks Related to this Article
There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. These Funds focus their investments in Europe; the impact of events and developments associated with the region can adversely affect performance.
The securities of small-capitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger-capitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole. The Funds use various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar, and these strategies may not be successful. 
DDEZ invests in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currency-hedge exposure. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Funds invest in the securities included in, or representative of, their Indexes regardless of their investment merit, and the Funds do not attempt to outperform their Indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets.  
Due to the investment strategy of these Funds, they may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read each Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each Fund’s risk profile. 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment loss.  
Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.
