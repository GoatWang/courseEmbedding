Biography[edit]
Born to a Jewish family, the son of Sylvia (née Steinberg)[2] and Albert Toll, he grew up in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.[1] His father, who emigrated from Ukraine,[3] was a millionaire investor who lost everything in the Stock market crash of 1929.[4] His first job was at Camp Powhatan in Otisfield, Maine where he was a counselor; it is now known as Seeds of Peace and is dedicated to bringing together Arab, Israeli, Indian, and Pakistani teenagers to promote peaceful conflict resolution.[1] In 1963, he graduated with a B.A. from Cornell University; and in 1966, he earned a LLB degree, cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[5] In 1967, Toll and his brother Bruce E. Toll founded Toll Brothers with a focus on building luxury homes ($500,000+)[4] starting with a plot of land in Chester County, Pennsylvania given to them by their father.[6] They grew the business using a conservative financial model always including a 10 percent cushion into all their projects and never assuming price appreciation during construction.[6] Bruce was responsible for the book-keeping and Robert the legal side of the business.[4] In the late 1980s, they expanded out of the Northeast to Washington, D.C. and in the mid-1990s, to California.[4] The Tolls are credited with mass-producing luxury housing by taking a few standard home styles and increasing the scale several fold.[6] Toll Brothers later expanded into building “active-adult” communities for the elderly affluent and urban high-rises for the newly affluent (Toll Brothers City Living).[6]
In 2010, Toll stepped down as CEO of Toll Brothers although he still remains active in its management.[7] In November 2013, Toll Brothers purchased Shapell Homes (founded by Nathan Shapell) for $1.6 billion.[8]
Philanthropy and accolades[edit]
In 1990, the Tolls sponsored 58 third graders in a program called Say Yes to Education guarantying a college education to each of them.[5] He served on the Board of Directors of the Cornell Real Estate Council, the Metropolitan Opera, Seeds of Peace, and Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.[5] He has been a long-time fundraiser for the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.[9]
Toll was a member of the Democratic National Finance Committee during the Obama campaign.[5][10] Toll also served on the Board of Overseers at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania where he established the Albert & Sylvia Toll Scholarship Foundation, named after his parents.[5] In 2005, Toll was named CEO of the Year by Professional Builder Magazine. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, he was named the "Best CEO in the Homebuilders & Building Products industry" by Institutional Investor magazine.
Personal life[edit]
Toll has been married twice.[1] In 1975, he married his second wife Jane.[11] They live in Miami Beach, Florida.[5] She has one son from her first marriage; Toll has two daughters from his first marriage; and they have a son and daughter together.[4]

Toll founded Toll Brothers with a focus on building luxury homes ($500,000+)[4] starting with a plot of land in Chester County, Pennsylvania given to them by their father.[6] They grew the business using a conservative financial model always including a 10 percent cushion into all their projects and never assuming price appreciation during construction.[6] Bruce was responsible for the book-keeping and Robert the legal side of the business.[4] In the late 1980s, they expanded out of the Northeast to Washington, D.C. and in the mid-1990s, to California.[4] The Tolls are credited with mass-producing luxury housing by taking a few standard home styles and increasing the scale several fold.[6] Toll Brothers later expanded into building “active-adult” communities for the elderly affluent and urban high-rises for the newly affluent (Toll Brothers City Living).[6]
In 2010, Toll stepped down as CEO of Toll Brothers although he still remains active in its management.[7] In November 2013, Toll Brothers purchased Shapell Homes (founded by Nathan Shapell) for $1.6 billion.[8]
Philanthropy and accolades[edit]
In 1990, the Tolls sponsored 58 third graders in a program called Say Yes to Education guarantying a college education to each of them.[5] He served on the Board of Directors of the Cornell Real Estate Council, the Metropolitan Opera, Seeds of Peace, and Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.[5] He has been a long-time fundraiser for the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.[9]
Toll was a member of the Democratic National Finance Committee during the Obama campaign.[5][10] Toll also served on the Board of Overseers at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania where he established the Albert & Sylvia Toll Scholarship Foundation, named after his parents.[5] In 2005, Toll was named CEO of the Year by Professional Builder Magazine. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, he was named the "Best CEO in the Homebuilders & Building Products industry" by Institutional Investor magazine.
Personal life[edit]
Toll has been married twice.[1] In 1975, he married his second wife Jane.[11] They live in Miami Beach, Florida.[5] She has one son from her first marriage; Toll has two daughters from his first marriage; and they have a son and daughter together.[4]

McMansion Master Robert Toll Loses $2.2 M. Penthouse to Son Jacob

			By Max Abelson • 02/12/08 11:11pm































This is a hard time to be the biggest luxury home builder in the United States: Robert Toll, the CEO of gargantuan Toll Brothers Inc., reportedly had his compensation cut from $19.2 million in 2006 to $8.4 million for the last fiscal year, as his company’s net income fell 95 percent to $35.7 million. 
Maybe taking the three-unit penthouse at One Ten 3RD, Toll’s hip rectangle-paneled new condo on Third Avenue, would have made him feel better? “I was going to buy the whole floor and reconfigure it, I was pretty excited,” Mr. Toll said this week, “and the boss decided that we weren’t going to move there.” 
The boss is his wife of 33 years, Jane. “So instead of me moving in, reconfiguring and building a luscious 21st floor, I went to Plan B,” he said, “went to my boy, and said, ‘Jacob, I think you ought to take advantage of this opportunity; it’s a great one.’ And he did.”


According to city records, the Robert & Jane Toll 2002 Children’s Trust, “for benefit of” their 27-year-old son, Jacob, paid $2,235,672 for just one of those three penthouse units. “Of course he didn’t take the whole floor,” his father said. Still, isn’t a three-bedroom apartment a lot for one 20-something? “He’s got a couple of buddies who live with him,” Mr. Toll said, “lifelong friends, from before college.” 
When asked if it was a present, he said the trust may or may not have his son’s own money. “Jake has made some pretty good dough already”—from development work in Telluride, Colo.—“and it’s not because of me.” Now he’s in social work school at N.Y.U.
A source said the space is over 1,400 square feet, with a balcony close to 200 square feet. And the Toll family didn’t get any special deals: The price is in line with other condos in the building. The sales manager, Halstead’s Felicia de Chabris, had no comment. 


When Mr. Toll was asked for a detail about his son’s apartment, he said: “It’s got really neat views, and there is a spectacular shower in it. It’s big and has a lot of gadgets in it, a lot of, not faucets—heads!”
As for those other two penthouse units, is he happy to have sold them off to buyers instead of keeping them in the family? “It’s not that it’s small beans for us—nothing is small, everything counts—but it’s not material, of course, to the business that Toll does.”

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 6 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $39.27 (1.11% upside)

Biography[edit]
Born to a Jewish family, the son of Sylvia (née Steinberg)[2] and Albert Toll, he grew up in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.[1] His father, who emigrated from Ukraine,[3] was a millionaire investor who lost everything in the Stock market crash of 1929.[4] His first job was at Camp Powhatan in Otisfield, Maine where he was a counselor; it is now known as Seeds of Peace and is dedicated to bringing together Arab, Israeli, Indian, and Pakistani teenagers to promote peaceful conflict resolution.[1] In 1963, he graduated with a B.A. from Cornell University; and in 1966, he earned a LLB degree, cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[5] In 1967, Toll and his brother Bruce E. Toll founded Toll Brothers with a focus on building luxury homes ($500,000+)[4] starting with a plot of land in Chester County, Pennsylvania given to them by their father.[6] They grew the business using a conservative financial model always including a 10 percent cushion into all their projects and never assuming price appreciation during construction.[6] Bruce was responsible for the book-keeping and Robert the legal side of the business.[4] In the late 1980s, they expanded out of the Northeast to Washington, D.C. and in the mid-1990s, to California.[4] The Tolls are credited with mass-producing luxury housing by taking a few standard home styles and increasing the scale several fold.[6] Toll Brothers later expanded into building “active-adult” communities for the elderly affluent and urban high-rises for the newly affluent (Toll Brothers City Living).[6]
In 2010, Toll stepped down as CEO of Toll Brothers although he still remains active in its management.[7] In November 2013, Toll Brothers purchased Shapell Homes (founded by Nathan Shapell) for $1.6 billion.[8]
Philanthropy and accolades[edit]
In 1990, the Tolls sponsored 58 third graders in a program called Say Yes to Education guarantying a college education to each of them.[5] He served on the Board of Directors of the Cornell Real Estate Council, the Metropolitan Opera, Seeds of Peace, and Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.[5] He has been a long-time fundraiser for the American Red Cross and the American Cancer Society.[9]
Toll was a member of the Democratic National Finance Committee during the Obama campaign.[5][10] Toll also served on the Board of Overseers at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and as a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania where he established the Albert & Sylvia Toll Scholarship Foundation, named after his parents.[5] In 2005, Toll was named CEO of the Year by Professional Builder Magazine. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, he was named the "Best CEO in the Homebuilders & Building Products industry" by Institutional Investor magazine.
Personal life[edit]
Toll has been married twice.[1] In 1975, he married his second wife Jane.[11] They live in Miami Beach, Florida.[5] She has one son from her first marriage; Toll has two daughters from his first marriage; and they have a son and daughter together.[4]

Toll Brothers, Inc. Marketing Contacts

   Ask not for whom the Tolls build, because if you have to ask you probably can't afford it. Toll Brothers builds luxury homes in the US, targeting move-up, second-home, and retired buyers. Its single-family detached houses and condominium apartments sell for an average price of over $700,000. The company also develops communities for active adults and operates country club communities. Subsidiaries offer related services and products including insurance coverage, title and mortgage services, and landscaping. Toll Brothers has operations in some 50 markets in nearly 20 states. Traditionally a suburban developer, Toll Brothers has branched out to high-rise condominiums in urban markets.
