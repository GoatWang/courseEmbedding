Convertible Securities

The complex nature of convertible securities – part equity and part debt – can lead mainstream stock and bond investors to overlook this asset class, creating an inefficient market and, thus, prices at which convertible securities can offer return without comparable risk. Our "bottom-up" approach to convertible securities emphasizes identifying those issues that offer the greatest bargain — those likely to capture a high percentage of the appreciation of the stocks into which they are convertible while limiting exposure to declines that may occur.


We manage three convertible securities strategies that focus on different regions and market sectors – U.S., non-U.S. and "high income" convertibles.
