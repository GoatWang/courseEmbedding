Depending on where you live, just about anything that improves your home’s efficiency, conserves energy, saves water or provides seismic or storm/wind protection is eligible.WATER EFFICIENCYSTORM/WIND PROTECTIONRENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY EFFICIENCYSEND ME A LIST OF QUALIFIED PROJECTS  How it worksWe walk you through each step from start to finish.Get Started Now!apply now  The smart alternative to traditional credit-based financing Get all your qualifying projects done at onceStop worrying about which home improvements to take on first.  Now you can bundle new efficient windows, insulation, and a cool roof into one project.No upfront paymentUpfront payments are the #1 barrier to moving forward on home improvements – especially those that cut energy usage.  Fixed terms up to 30 yearsNo balloon payments. No funny business with fees. Just one competitive rate locked in for the long haul. Make payments through your property tax bill.Energy savings may pay for the improvementsYou can control how much you save.  Whether it’s windows and insulation for efficiency or adding solar to the mix, we find the right balance for you and your home. And your pocketbook, of course.Payments may stay with the propertyIf you sell your home, your payments may transfer to the new owner, just like your property taxes—so you only pay for improvements while you use them.*Eligibility based on property equityYgrene financing isn’t considered personal debt. Eligibility is based on property equity, among other factors. There’s no reason to take on debt for home improvements anymore. (Your credit report will be requested during the application process).*Some lenders may require full repayment upon sale or refinance. Service Areas      Want Ygrene in your community?

On top of that, our energy bills went down $100 every month since we changed our AC. With all of this, our improvements are paying for themselves!

 About Us – Ygrene Works                866-634-1358     |     Contractor Login    From California to Florida How we became the company that…Created 8,000 local jobs.Invested 1.34 billion dollars into local economies.Drove 644,000 Mtons reduction in greenhouse gasses. About YgreneYgrene Energy Fund is the nation’s leading provider of residential, multifamily and commercial property assessed clean energy financing. The award-winning, privately funded YgreneWorksTM program provides immediately accessible financing with no upfront payments for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and, in certain areas, water conservation, storm and wind protection, electric vehicle charging stations and seismic upgrades. Ygrene is committed to making it easy for property owners to invest in their future and a healthier environment. Over the next five years, YgreneWorks is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs and invest several billion dollars into local economies. Our Story Starts HereWe started a mission: To make energy-smart home and building improvements easy, accessible, and affordable for every property owner. We believe government, business, and individuals can come together to make that happen.In the Spring of 2006, Dennis Hunter co-founded and organized a four-bank lending system called Green Energy Loan (GEL) for the purpose of facilitating financing that would enable homeowners to retrofit their homes to reduce carbon emissions. This project led, in part, to the inception of Sonoma County’s PACE Program (“SCEIP”). In response to the success of SCEIP, Mr. Hunter realized the need for a more efficient administrative and financial model. GEL quickly added software development personnel, began work on the web tools needed to underpin a fully scaled-up national PACE program and recruited a management team to propagate the business throughout the country.The team also refined the business model and created marketing plans, resulting in the formal founding of Ygrene Energy Fund. Through the summer and fall of 2010, Ygrene entered into discussions with multiple local banks to secure the strong financial partnerships that provide the backbone for Ygrene’s fully funded model. With the combination of a virtually limitless source of capital, a wealth of financial expertise and strong relationships with industry leaders, Ygrene is now in a position to offer turnkey Clean Energy Financing District setup, administration and financing throughout the U.S.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Ygrene Energy Fund, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

  Y Greene Energy - Let’s recycle, and protect the environment, together           Y Greene Energy   Let’s recycle, and protect the environment, together Our History   We have entered dumpster rental business because we saw the need for waste containers. This opened our eyes, and we saw the need for recycle bins. The next step we did was evident; we started accepting contaminants and recycling them to save the environment.   The recycling business flourished due to environmental-friendly people. This convinces us that people want to protect the nature and that they just need a way to do it. The recycling facility was our answer to the needs of those individuals who keep it running continuously with regularly contaminated waste deliveries.Our OfferWe have been in this business for a long time, and we have branched out to cover different types of work to satisfy the needs of the community and to help in the protection of nature. We went from dumpster rental only to recycling, and we plan to grow even more when the need arises. Classic dumpster and roll-off container rental lie at the very basis of our offer. We rent all kinds of dumpsters, from small commercial to large roll-off containers that can accept over 40 cubic yards of waste. Check our offer, and you will surely find something that will fit you and your project. We also rent various containers that can hold waste that will contaminate the surroundings if not handled properly. Those bottles go straight to our recycling facility where we turn it in either waste that won’t harm the nature or re-usable materials, depending on the components of the same. Our offer includes evaluation of the work to ascertain the size of the debris it will leave. The evaluation also checks whether any environment-damaging waste will be left after the project ends. This assessment helps us to recommend the significant dumpster and additional containers that will hold all of the debris.Recent WorkThe Ygrene-Energy was a part of many projects throughout its history, and we were part of some large-scale projects that we are proud of. This includes work on large construction sites as well as being a part of environmental actions that had a positive impact on the overall health of nature in our area. One thing that we are proud is our involvement with various environmental-friendly movements whose aim is to preserve and protect the life. One of such things started last year and went on to become an annual event as it happened this year as well. The community gathered around the idea of cleaning the nature and recycling the waste that was found in the countryside. We offered our help by accepting the waste they found and recycling it. A large number of people and businesses joined the cause, and we ended up with a lot of recycled material that we safely reintroduced to the community. Another big project that we are proud to be part of the construction of the two buildings that contain more than 100 apartments in total. Our part of the job was to clear the debris as it was created and not allow it to pile up and create more work. The coordination between our employees and the management was excellent, and the trucks that drive roll-off containers kept the construction site clean throughout the building process. The landfill station also did a great job of organizing the spread of the waste we delivered, and we had no problems, and we kept up to schedule without breaking it.NewsDisposal MaterialsDumpsterRecyclingWaste     2017 01 16 Who do i call when i want to recycle a dumpster Gabriella Peck Dumpster, Recycling, Waste Dumpster, Recycling, WasteYgrene-Energy – Recycling all dumpster banned waste The amount of waste that goes that ends in landfills is staggeringly huge, which is OK, as long as the waste is biodegradable and it doesn’t contain toxins.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF
















Fund Description
VanEck Vectors® Global Alternative Energy ETF (GEX®) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Ardour Global IndexSM Extra Liquid (AGIXLT), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in the business of alternative energy. Alternative energy includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), bio mass, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources, and also includes various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
