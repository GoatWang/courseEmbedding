                MRC Global is not only acquiring a new company in the Permian Basin, but it is also… more 








 



MRC Global Inc. (NYSE: MRC) has snapped up a valve automation company — Odessa, Texas-based Flow Control Products, also known as Dan H. Brown Inc. — to expand its footprint in the Permian Basin.
Houston-based MRC, a distributor of pipe, valves and fittings for the oil and gas industry, said it plans to continue operating Flow Control Products’ business as an MRC Valve Automation Center.

Furthermore, MRC said it plans on further expanding its existing operations in Odessa by moving into a 110,000-square-foot distribution center. Starting in 2014, Flow Control Products will operate in the expanded facility.

Flow Control Products currently has 25 employees and provides pneumatic, electric and electro-hydraulic valve automation services that support oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin. In 2012, the company had revenues of $28 million.
Throughout the past year, MRC Global has made other investments in the Permian Basin area. In November, the company acquired the assets of Midland-based Production Specialty Services Inc., a supplier of pipes, valves and fillings to the oil and gas industry.
