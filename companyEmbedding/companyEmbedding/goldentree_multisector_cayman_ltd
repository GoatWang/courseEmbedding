References to GoldenTree shall be deemed to include GoldenTree Asset Management LP and any of its affiliated entities.
Assets Under Management
Total assets, with respect to the structured product portfolios, such as CLOs, include the effects of leverage and available capital to invest. With respect to managed funds and accounts that have “private equity” type terms, assets under management include investors’ committed capital until such time as the applicable investment period has terminated.

Such offerings are made, and such investment advisory services are offered, only to persons who are "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Responses to any inquiry which may involve rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation effecting or attempting to effect transactions in securities will not be made absent compliance with state broker-dealer, investment advisor, broker-dealer agent or investment advisor representative registration requirements, or applicable exemptions or exclusions from such requirements.

GoldenTree defines a distressed asset as an investment in the debt or equity of an issuer that, for reasons that may include operational, financial or market-related stress, has seen its value decline to a level that in its analysis was materially below the fundamental value of the asset.

Some or all of the information on this website may be a financial promotion for the purposes of the Handbook of Rules and Guidance issued by the FCA (the “FCA Rules”).  Where such information relates to one or more Funds, it is exempt from the restriction in section 238(1) of the FSMA on the communication of an invitation or inducement to participate in a collective investment scheme, on the basis that this document is issued by us only to and/or is directed by us only at persons who are categorised as either professional clients or eligible counterparties (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) in respect of interests in the relevant Fund(s).  The investments and investment services to which the information on this website relates are not available to other persons and such other persons should, therefore, not act or rely on it.

Commitment to the UK Stewardship Code
Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non compliance.
GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction.
