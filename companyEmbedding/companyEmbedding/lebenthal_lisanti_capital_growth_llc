Mutual funds are subject to market risk. Investments in small-sized companies pose greater risks than those typically associated with larger, more established companie, such as increased volatility of earnings and prospects, higher failure rates, and limited markets, product lines, or financial resources.Alpha is the difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta.  The difference is expressed as an annualized percentage.  Beta is the measure of a fund's volatility relative to a comparative index.  By definition, the beta of an index is 1.00.  Accordingly, a fund with a 1.10 beta is expected to perform 10% better than the index in up markets and 10% worse in down markets.

Process
Our investment process is both dynamic and disciplined—one part science, one part art. Intellectually agnostic, it combines disciplined methodology and gut intuition to limit excessive risk and capture the great return potential small caps offer.  
Ours is a parallel, nonlinear process that creates a "virtuous circle" of investment thought. It combines our top-down perspective with bottom-up analysis—so we don't trip over our feet while our heads are in the clouds. It requires relevant experience and sound judgment.

Database Analysis: Invest in companies with the wind at their back
It starts with a database of approximately 5,500 companies, that we whittle down to those we believe will thrive regardless of economic trends. We look for many signs. Do they have a profitable business model based on intellectual property or a unique strategy? Maybe there's new management, a new product launch, or a change in their market's competitive landscape. Other things we look for include low debt, expected earnings growth of at least 15%, a history of success, and experienced management teams. This initial screening process narrows our field to approximately 300 companies.
Fundamental Research: Get out and kick the tires
We take a closer look at their earnings power, competitive environment, and product offerings. If we see a compelling story, we'll pay them a visit to make sure their fundamentals and values are a reality—not just on paper. In fact, nothing tells you more about a company than meeting their management team face to face. And we take the time to do this.
Theme Orientation: Move the way the world is moving
Investing in small caps requires creatively examining the political, social, economic, and technological movements that are shaping the world. Once we've identified these themes, we isolate the companies most likely to succeed in their wake. This helps us focus our thinking, take advantage of trends, and capitalize on strategic shifts in the global marketplace. It also maximizes our upside potential.
Sell Discipline: Get when the getting's good
Rising stars can explode. If our original thesis is no longer valid or price momentum deteriorates, we sell. We also sell when stocks do well. Of course, some stocks continue to thrive after we sell. But we believe that if you hang on for the last dollar, you run the risk of selling at a loss. No thanks.

Lebenthal Lisanti Capital Growth Proxy Voting Policy
In recognition of the fiduciary obligation that Lebenthal Lisanti Capital Growth ("Lebenthal Lisanti")  has to its clients, Lebenthal Lisanti has developed a proxy voting policy that seeks to promote effective corporate governance structures. The policy seeks to promote general corporate responsibility, while also seeking to create and preserve economic value.  Within this framework, Lebenthal Lisanti always votes proxies in what it believes are the best interests of its respective clients. To implement its proxy voting policy, Lebenthal Lisanti has developed proxy voting guidelines and procedures which seek to ensure that individual proxy voting decisions reflect Lebenthal Lisanti's proxy voting philosophy and positively affect the long-term value of client assets.
A Proxy Committee has been formed by Lebenthal Lisanti to oversee Lebenthal Lisanti's proxy voting program.  In addition, Lebenthal Lisanti has designated "Proxy Administrators" who are responsible for monitoring corporate actions, making voting decisions, and ensuring that proxies are submitted in a timely manner.  In order to facilitate the proxy voting process, Lebenthal Lisanti has contracted with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to vote proxies for Lebenthal Lisanti's accounts on Lebenthal Lisanti's behalf.  ISS provides Lebenthal Lisanti with proxy analysis and voting recommendations, vote execution according to Lebenthal Lisanti's proxy voting guidelines, and quarterly reporting indicating how individual votes have been cast.>
The Proxy Administrators will periodically review ISS's recommendations, and may override individual recommendations in certain cases. Vote overrides could potentially occur in instances where Lebenthal Lisanti has obtained additional information regarding a company committing to undertaking specific positive corporate governance change.  In addition, there may be instances where the Proxy Administrators determine that it is in the best economic interests of clients to abstain from voting at individual shareholder meetings, such as in instances where foreign proxy issuers impose unreasonable or expensive voting or holding requirements or when the costs to effect a vote would be uneconomic relative to the value of the client's investment in the issuer. 
Application of the Lebenthal Lisanti proxy voting guidelines to vote client proxies should in most instances adequately address possible conflicts of interest since the voting guidelines are pre-determined by Lebenthal Lisanti's Proxy Committee based upon recommendations from ISS, an independent third party. In cases where the Proxy Committee has determined that there may be a material conflict of interest regarding a particular security, Lebenthal Lisanti will default to ISS's voting recommendations for that proposal and will not have the ability to override the recommendations. When Lebenthal Lisanti votes in a manner that would deviate from Lebenthal Lisanti's proxy voting guidelines, the Proxy Committee will review all such proxy votes in order to determine whether the portfolio manager's voting rationale appears reasonable. 
Lebenthal Lisanti reviews proxy voting policy, guidelines, and procedures on an annual basis to take into account the latest trends in corporate governance.  Clients may contact Lebenthal Lisanti via telephone at 1-212-792-6990 or via e-mail at 

 

 to obtain information on how Lebenthal Lisanti voted such client's proxies and to request a copy of Lebenthal Lisanti's proxy voting policy and procedures.

Philosophy
We have been immersed in investment management for a number of years and understand what it takes to create a successful firm. Our investment professionals have a passion for investing—we love stocks. We have an investment discipline, and we stick with it. We understand that we are fiduciaries—we are committed to doing what is best for our clients. And because our value proposition to our clients is our ability to generate good returns, we have created a corporate culture and structure that foster our core attributes in every professional who works here.

Our operating philosophy is centered around three core beliefs:

That active managers, in inefficient markets, can be successful at producing alpha;
That a disciplined investment process and small, focused teams can produce above-average returns; and  
That our clients are partners in the investment process—we have the same ultimate goals.
We add value through our investing philosophy. Investing in small companies is the art of managing the unknown and forecasting the future. The investment process we have always used seeks to identify the risks in investing in a small company and identify which ones are within a management's control. Then we make an assessment based on experience and our view of the world—on how likely these risks are to become reality. We develop a thesis on a company and track that thesis closely. We use a multi-pronged process to do this. 
We seek companies and themes with the potential to change the way the world thinks, works, and plays. It's why we concentrate on finding the key investment themes that will provide exceptional long-term opportunity. We then make sure we're positioned early in the companies that will benefit most from these themes. 
Research and market expertise will be our barometer—helping us to identify critical inflection points early, so we can react accordingly. Our adherence to a strict sell discipline will add stability. It limits downside risk and increases the probability of capturing larger returns.
And we will always view our clients as long-term partners in the process of building wealth. We will aim to achieve this wealth by an unwavering commitment to our disciplined, research-focused investment process, which has been structured with one goal: delivering strong returns. 
To make it all possible, we will create a culture that's faithful to the unorthodox wisdom and hyper-focus required for delivering excellence in small-cap investing.

About the Fund




								The Lebenthal Lisanti Small Cap Growth Fund uses an aggressive growth approach to seek above-average maximum capital appreciation through small cap investing. The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in the common stock of smaller, lesser-known U.S. companies that the Portfolio Manager believes are in an early stage or transitional point in their development and have above average prospects for growth.  
The Fund's investment process focuses on two key areas-security selection and portfolio construction.  The Portfolio Manager uses a disciplined investment process that includes the following components:
Database Screening-The Portfolio Manager applies a quantitative screening process to the universe of small capitalization companies to identify those companies with fundamental strengths. The Portfolio Manager also looks for companies with positive catalysts that may offer a potential acceleration in the growth rate of the company.
Themes-The Portfolio Manager intends the Fund's investments to reflect what she believes to be the major social, economic and technological trends (collectively, "Themes") that will shape the future of business and commerce over the next three to five years.  These themes will provide a framework for identifying the industries and companies in which the Fund will invest.
Fundamental Research-Fundamental research focuses on identifying several types of companies that the Portfolio Manager believes offer promising growth potential:  small, fast growing companies that offer innovative products, services or technologies to a rapidly expanding marketplace; companies experiencing a major change which is expected to produce advantageous results, such as new management, products or technologies, restructuring or reorganization, or merger and acquisition.  Once purchased, portfolio holdings are monitored closely, and new information is evaluated relative to the original reason for investing.
Sell Discipline-In general, stocks are sold when valuation targets are achieved, changing circumstances affect the original reasons for the investment, the company exhibits deteriorating fundamentals, or when the Portfolio Manager believes more attractive alternatives exist.

Acquisition Continues Growth of Firm's Assets Under Management








“Mary Lisanti is a trailblazing woman in the world of asset management, and I couldn’t be more proud to have her join our team. I am a passionate supporter of woman-owned businesses, and am thrilled we were able to make this transaction happen.”


NEW YORK, NY (PRWEB)
March 02, 2015
 Lebenthal Asset Management [LAM], the asset management division of Lebenthal Holdings, LLC, announced today that it has acquired a minority stake in AH Lisanti Capital Growth, LLC, a New York-based woman-owned SEC-registered investment advisor. Concurrently, Alexandra Lebenthal, CEO of Lebenthal Holdings, has also acquired a minority interest in AH Lisanti Capital Growth, LLC, which will operate as Lebenthal Lisanti Capital Growth, LLC (LLCG) following completion of the transaction and continue to be a woman-owned firm. 
Founder Mary Lisanti, a 35-year veteran of the investment management industry, will remain President of LLCG, and she and Ms. Lebenthal will be Managing Members of LLCG. Ms. Lisanti remains the firm’s largest shareholder. Berkshire Capital assisted in the transaction, the terms of which were not disclosed. 
“I am pleased to welcome Mary Lisanti and her team to Lebenthal,” said James B. Lebenthal, CEO of Lebenthal Asset Management. “Her specific market expertise will be a welcome addition to the range of strategies that LAM can offer to our investors and wealth management clients. Her formidable track record and client-centric focus will truly extend and complement the Lebenthal tradition.”
“Mary Lisanti is a trailblazing woman in the world of asset management, and I couldn’t be more proud to have her join our team,” said Alexandra Lebenthal, CEO of Lebenthal Holdings. “I am a passionate supporter of woman-owned businesses, and am thrilled we were able to make this transaction happen.” 
“We are very pleased with our new relationship with Lebenthal Asset Management,” said Mary Lisanti. “We appreciate the Lebenthal heritage of strong female leadership, starting with Sayra Lebenthal who co-founded the company in 1925, and we look forward to sharing our investment- and client-centered cultures and building on each other’s strengths.”  
Lebenthal Lisanti Capital Growth LLC, which as of December 31, 2014 oversaw $290 million in client assets, specializes in smaller capitalization, high-growth equity investment strategies and a recently launched small/mid cap growth strategy. LLCG offers asset management for large corporations, endowments and foundations, and public funds through separately managed accounts, and to individual investors through its mutual fund, which will be renamed Lebenthal Lisanti Small Cap Growth (ASCGX). 
Ms. Lisanti founded AH Lisanti Capital Growth in 2003, as a joint venture with Adams Harkness & Hill. Previously, she was CIO of ING Investments. In that capacity, she was responsible for building the active equity investment management team. Before that, at Bankers Trust, she headed the small/mid cap investment team, started several mutual funds and helped launch international products as well. In 1996, she was named Fund Manager of the Year by Barron’s magazine. She began her career as a small cap analyst and strategist, achieving the #1 ranking in Institutional Investor’s All-Star Research Team in 1989.
