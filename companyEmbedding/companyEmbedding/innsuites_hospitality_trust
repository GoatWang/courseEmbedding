Hotel Tempe Phoenix Airport Pet Friendly
Hotel Tempe/Phoenix Airport InnSuites Hotel & Suites is Pet Friendly. 
On behalf of our four-legged management team at Hotel Tempe/Phoenix Airport InnSuites, we would like to welcome you and your two-legged handlers to our pet friendly hotel.
At our hotel, we understand that owners want and enjoy the comfort of their animals while traveling away from home.
We strive to ensure all guests (animal and human) experience a comfortable, memorable and safe stay with us.
Remember, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask us to ensure your stay is a Purrrfect Place to Paws. 

Our Pet Guidelines: 

Our pet fee is $20 per stay for 1-2 pets and an additional $20 per pet per above 2. 
 Enjoy your pet welcome treat—we have had rave reviews about them!
 If your owners are going to leave the room unattended, please stay in your crate if possible. Also, please have your owners contact the front desk so in case of an emergency, we can contact them by cell phone. There is nothing worse than being left to bark to go to the bathroom!
 If walking around the property, all humans must be attached to your leash.
 Unfortunately the hotel does not allow us (pets) to be in the restaurant, pool area, exercise facility, or meeting room.
 If you have an accident on the grounds of the property, please talk to your owner about picking up after you. Remember, they were once young and didn’t always make it to the bathroom either!
 If you use cat litter, please don’t put it down the toilet—the plumber doesn’t like it!
 The best place to eat in a hotel room is on the tile—it is non-porous and easy to clean.
 If staying more than 1 night, please have your owner arrange a time with housekeeping so the hotel’s room attendants can service the room. Room attendants are not allowed to clean the room with a pet in the room.
 If you don’t behave and cause damage to the room, your owners will incur fees for damage to the room, or if significant cleaning is needed prior to renting of the room.
 If you need a vet, ask the front desk.
 Guide dogs will be given access to all guest areas including public spaces and restaurants—they are very very special in the work they do! 


Pet Etiquette
Please call ahead to ensure we have availability and pet friendly studios available.
We look forward to serving you.

Tourist Information – Tempe/Phoenix’s East Valley Arizona

Our Arizona accommodations are the perfect start to your exploration of Phoenix – you’ll feel like you are staying in a Tempe resort! The Phoenix area’s elevation is 1,117 feet and is located in the heart of the Sonoran Desert. It is a sprawling metropolitan desert area that extends from trendy Scottsdale in the northeast, to Glendale and numerous expanding towns in the west. In the heart of the Greater Phoenix area is Tempe, high action university town-home to Arizona State University. To the east lie cities including Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek and Mesa. Desert mountains surround the area, creating “The Valley of the Sun.” There are six lakes within a 75-minute drive of Tempe/Phoenix. 
The Phoenix Convention Center offers more than 900,000 square feet of meeting and event space and more than two million in total square footage, making it one of the top 20 convention venues in the United States. The 24-acre Phoenix Convention Center, in the heart of Copper Square, has been hosting national and regional conventions and trade shows as well as consumer events and theatrical productions since it opened in 1972. And, as Phoenix has undergone tremendous growth through the years by attracting high-technology businesses, transplants from other states, and an increase in tourism, so has the Phoenix Convention Center. In the mid-90s the Phoenix Convention Center embarked on an ambitious $32 million renovation project to update and enhance its image and keep the facility competitive for convention and trade show business. The massive interior and exterior refurbishing included the addition of 60,000 square feet of shaded patio area including a 15,000 square foot tent and flanking galleries on elegant Symphony Hall Terrace. An additional $1.5 million interior renovation incorporated Southwest accent colors including burgundy, sage, and muted tones of slate and gold. The unique carpet pattern represents the city’s vibrant growth, with a digitized pattern incorporating a distinctive aerial view of downtown Phoenix.

BEST WESTERN InnSuites Hotel Pet Friendly
BEST WESTERN InnSuites Tucson Foothills Hotel & Suites is Pet Friendly. 
On behalf of our four-legged management team at BEST WESTERN InnSuites Tucson, we would like to welcome you and your two-legged handlers to our pet friendly hotel.
At our hotel, we understand that owners want and enjoy the comfort of their animals while traveling away from home.
We strive to ensure all guests (animal and human) experience a comfortable, memorable and safe stay with us.
Remember, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask us to ensure your stay is a Purrrfect Place to Paws.

Our Pet Guidelines:

Our pet fee is $20 per stay for 1-2 pets and an additional $20 per pet per above 2.
Enjoy your pet welcome treat—we have had rave reviews about them!
If your owners are going to leave the room unattended, please stay in your crate if possible. Also, please have your owners contact the front desk so in case of an emergency, we can contact them by cell phone. There is nothing worse than being left to bark to go to the bathroom!
If walking around the property, all humans must be attached to your leash.
Unfortunately the hotel does not allow us (pets) to be in the restaurant, pool area, exercise facility, or meeting room.
If you have an accident on the grounds of the property, please talk to your owner about picking up after you. Remember, they were once young and didn’t always make it to the bathroom either!
If you use cat litter, please don’t put it down the toilet—the plumber doesn’t like it!
The best place to eat in a hotel room is on the tile—it is non-porous and easy to clean.
If staying more than 1 night, please have your owner arrange a time with housekeeping so the hotel’s room attendants can service the room. Room attendants are not allowed to clean the room with a pet in the room.
If you don’t behave and cause damage to the room, your owners will incur fees for damage to the room, or if significant cleaning is needed prior to renting of the room.
If you need a vet, ask the front desk.
Guide dogs will be given access to all guest areas including public spaces and restaurants—they are very very special in the work they do!


Pet Etiquette
Please call ahead to ensure we have availability and pet friendly studios available.
We look forward to serving you.

Our pet fee is $20 per stay for 1-2 pets and an additional $20 per pet per above 2.
Enjoy your pet welcome treat—we have had rave reviews about them!
If your owners are going to leave the room unattended, please stay in your crate if possible. Also, please have your owners contact the front desk so in case of an emergency, we can contact them by cell phone. There is nothing worse than being left to bark to go to the bathroom!
If walking around the property, all humans must be attached to your leash.
Unfortunately the hotel does not allow us (pets) to be in the restaurant, pool area, exercise facility, or meeting room.
If you have an accident on the grounds of the property, please talk to your owner about picking up after you. Remember, they were once young and didn’t always make it to the bathroom either!
If you use cat litter, please don’t put it down the toilet—the plumber doesn’t like it!
The best place to eat in a hotel room is on the tile—it is non-porous and easy to clean.
If staying more than 1 night, please have your owner arrange a time with housekeeping so the hotel’s room attendants can service the room. Room attendants are not allowed to clean the room with a pet in the room.
If you don’t behave and cause damage to the room, your owners will incur fees for damage to the room, or if significant cleaning is needed prior to renting of the room.

Tourist Information for our Phoenix Hotel Guests

Phoenix’s elevation is 1,117 feet and is located in the heart of the Sonoran Desert.
It is a sprawling metropolitan desert area that extends from trendy Scottsdale in the northeast, to sporty Glendale and numerous expanding towns in the west.
In the heart of the Greater Phoenix area is Tempe, an active university town-home to Arizona State University.
To the east lie cities including Chandler, Gilbert, Queen Creek and Mesa.
Desert mountains surround the area, creating “The Valley of the Sun” There are six lakes within a 75-minute drive of Phoenix.
BEST WESTERN InnSuites Phoenix Biltmore is about 15 minutes to the Phoenix Convention Center, Symphony Hall and Orpheum Theatre.
The Phoenix Convention Center offers more than 900,000 square feet of meeting and event space and more than two million in total square footage, making it one of the top 20 convention venues in the United States. The 24-acre Phoenix Convention Center, in the heart of Copper Square, has been hosting national and regional conventions and trade shows as well as consumer events and theatrical productions since it opened in 1972. And, as Phoenix has undergone tremendous growth through the years by attracting high-technology businesses, transplants from other states, and an increase in tourism, so has the Phoenix Convention Center. In the mid-90s the Phoenix Convention Center embarked on an ambitious $32 million renovation project to update and enhance its image and keep the facility competitive for convention and trade show business. The massive interior and exterior refurbishing included the addition of 60,000 square feet of shaded patio area including a 15,000 square foot tent and flanking galleries on elegant Symphony Hall Terrace. An additional $1.5 million interior renovation incorporated Southwest accent colors including burgundy, sage, and muted tones of slate and gold. The unique carpet pattern represents the city’s vibrant growth, with a digitized pattern incorporating a distinctive aerial view of downtown Phoenix.

Phoenix , AZ 85020
Ph (602) 944-1286
Nestled in the shadow of Squaw Peak Mountain, Aunt Chilada’s Mexican food is truly an historic landmark with a personality all its own. Constructed in the 1890s from desert stone and railroad ties, the original building served as a supply depot and general store for the mercury miners passing through the Dreamy Draw. Today, Aunt Chilada’s not only carries on that century-old tradition of heartfelt Southwestern hospitality, but also dishes out a large helping of fun along with the finest Mexican food this side of the border. Now, Aunt Chilada’s has added a little ” algo differente” the Palapa Bar.

Phoenix , AZ 85020
Ph (602) 707-0049
For those who love takeout Chinese but can’t find a restaurant that’s fast enough, clean enough, cheap enough or good enough, Pei Wei (pronounced “pay way”) is a godsend. Red floors, black accents and an exhibition kitchen hung with giant woks give this room a dramatic impact way beyond its price point. The menu isn’t strictly Chinese, but rather Pan-Asian, offering the edamame of Japan, the pad thai of Thailand and the rice-paper wraps of Vietnam. Still, the bulk of the menu features fresh and colorful preparations such as kung pao and Cantonese black bean (all paired with chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops, vegetables or five-spice tofu).
 
Morton’s

Pizzeria Bianco
 
623 E Adams St.
Phoenix, AZ 85004
Ph (602) 258-8300
The restaurant takes its name from Chris Bianco, has achieved rock star status since in 2001, New York food writer Ed Levine proclaimed Bianco’s product the best in the nation, and in 2003, Chris Bianco won the coveted James Beard award. In addition to the foodie praise, there has also been attention from various celebrities. Bianco has been featured on both Oprah Winfrey’s and Martha Stewart’s shows. Jerry Seinfeld has named Chris Bianco his “pizza consultant.” The reason for this mania is a straightforward menu of just half a dozen expertly crafted pizzas.

Lone Star owns and operates a chain of mid-priced, full-service, casual dining restaurants that serve mesquite grilled steaks, ribs, chicken, and fish.

The exciting and vibrant atmosphere created by the restaurants’ “Texas Roadhouse” ambiance is enhanced by specially selected upbeat country western music and neon signs. The decor includes planked wooden floors, “dim lighting,” flags and other Texas memorabilia, all of which enhance the casual dining experience and establish a distinct identity for our concept. Lone Star is further distinguished by its high quality, USDA choice-graded steaks which are hand-cut fresh daily at each restaurant and mesquite grilled to order.
