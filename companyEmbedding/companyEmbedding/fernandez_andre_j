There’s a new boss at CBS Radio. Journal Communications and G.E. vet Andre J. Fernandez has been named president of the Eye’s radio station group. Dan Mason, who has headed the group for the past 15 years, will retire.
Fernandez will oversee the group of 117 stations serving 26 major markets. CBS’ radio stations and its digital offshoots are core to the Eye’s strategy of building local media hubs in markets served by its radio and TV stations. He reports to CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves and is based in New York.
“Andre is a terrific executive who brings a wealth of experience to this role – operations, financial management, programming and digital distribution, among many other attributes,” said Moonves. “He has had great success working in large and mid-sized markets, which has primed him to lead our major market operations. I’m confident Andre’s many qualities will make him a superb manager and help build upon an incredible foundation at CBS Radio.”







Fernandez most recently served as president-COO of station group owner Journal Communications, overseeing its broadcast and publishing operations. Before joining Journal he worked for General Electric in a variety of posts including at Telemundo following NBC’s acquisition of the Spanish-language broadcaster.
Fernandez takes the reins next week. Mason on Monday made an internal announcement of his intention to retire after 17 years with the Eye.
“Dan is a legendary leader in the radio business,” Moonves said. “His passion for the business is well-known, and is a major reason why he’s been able to turn around so many of our major market stations. Above all, he’s been a good friend and a superb colleague.”

Andre J. Fernandez, who was president and chief operating officer of Journal Communications Inc. before its recent broadcast merger and publishing spinoff, has been named president of CBS Radio in New York.
In his new role, Fernandez, who begins next week, will oversee the direction and management of the radio division, which includes 117 stations in 26 major markets as well as a growing collection of digital assets, CBS said Monday.
Fernandez will report to Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Corp.
Fernandez succeeds Dan Mason, who announced his retirement Monday after 17 years with the company.
Fernandez joined Journal Communications in 2008 from NBC Universal Telemundo as executive vice president of finance and strategy. He was named president in 2012 and chief operating officer in 2014, responsible for operational oversight of Milwaukee-based Journal's broadcast and publishing segments as well as a number of corporate functions. He also held the role of chief financial officer from 2008 through 2014.
On April 1, the broadcast unit of Journal Communications merged with the television division of Cincinnati-based The E.W. Scripps Co. while Journal's publishing unit was spun off and joined with the publishing division of Scripps to form a new company, Journal Media Group.

Andre J. Fernandez Named President of CBS RADIO

Broadcasting Veteran to Oversee Company's Portfolio of Major Market Radio Stations
Executive Brings Operations, Financial and Programming Experience to Position




Apr 13, 2015, 2:17pm EDT














NEW YORK, April 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Andre J. Fernandez has been named President of CBS RADIO, one of the nation's leading collections of major market radio stations. The announcement was made by Leslie Moonves, President and CEO of CBS Corporation, to whom Fernandez will report. He begins next week and will be based in New York.
In this role, Fernandez will oversee the direction and management of the division, which includes 117 stations in 26 major markets as well as a growing collection of digital assets. He was most recently President and Chief Operating Officer of Journal Communications, where he was responsible for the company's broadcasting and publishing assets.
"Andre is a terrific executive who brings a wealth of experience to this role -- operations, financial management, programming and digital distribution, among many other attributes," said Moonves. "He has had great success working in large and mid-sized markets, which has primed him to lead our major market operations. I'm confident Andre's many qualities will make him a superb manager and help build upon an incredible foundation at CBS RADIO."
"CBS is an exceptional media company, and this is a terrific opportunity to join a world-class operation and continue its growth and innovation," said Fernandez. "I'm very impressed with not only CBS's collection of market-leading brands, but the interface it has achieved with its complementary TV and digital assets, which gives us great opportunities for further development. I could not be more pleased to join this outstanding team."
Fernandez succeeds Dan Mason, who announced his retirement earlier today after 17 years with the Company, during which he led CBS RADIO for a total of 15 years.
"Dan is a legendary leader in the radio business," said Moonves. "His passion for the business is well-known, and is a major reason why he's been able to turn around so many of our major market stations. Above all, he's been a good friend and a superb colleague. We will miss him dearly and thank him very much."
Previously, Fernandez served in several executive positions at Journal Communications, a publicly traded diversified media company. Named President in 2012 and Chief Operating Officer in 2014, Fernandez was responsible for operational oversight of Journal's broadcast and publishing segments, as well as a number of corporate functions. He also served as the company's Chief Financial Officer from 2008 through 2014.
Prior to Journal, Fernandez held a variety of financial leadership roles at the General Electric Company. Following GE/NBC's acquisition of the Telemundo Communications Group in 2001, Fernandez was named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Telemundo, where he helped steer the company to its best financial performance in history. During his tenure, Fernandez also led the acquisitions of Telemundo-RTI Studios and Tepuy International and helped create the Yahoo!Telemundo digital joint venture. Prior to Telemundo, Fernandez held the positions of Chief Financial Officer and Controller of GE Latin America, based in Mexico City; Chief Financial Officer of GE's Digital Energy business, based in Atlanta; Assistant Treasurer of GE Corporate Treasury and Chief Financial Officer of GE Capital Information Technology Solutions (ITS), both based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Before joining General Electric, Fernandez was FP&A and Treasury Manager for the United Technologies Corporation in both the U.S. and Brazil. Fernandez began his career on Wall Street, first as a banking associate with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York and then as Assistant Vice President with Merrill Lynch's emerging markets group in both New York and London. He is fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese.
A New York native, Fernandez graduated cum laude from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. He currently serves on the boards of the Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) and Froedtert Health, an academic medical center and regional hospital system in southeast Wisconsin, where he is Vice Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Finance Committee and Member of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee. He is a member of the Greater Milwaukee Committee (GMC) and is also an active alumni interviewer for Harvard University.

Congratulations Andre J. Fernandez



Broadcasting Veteran to Oversee Company’s Portfolio of Major Market Radio Stations
Executive Brings Operations, Financial and Programming Experience to Position
Andre J. Fernandez has been named President of CBS RADIO, one of the nation’s leading collections of major market radio stations. The announcement was made by Leslie Moonves, President and CEO of CBS Corporation, to whom Fernandez will report. He begins next week and will be based in New York.
In this role, Fernandez will oversee the direction and management of the division, which includes 117 stations in 26 major markets as well as a growing collection of digital assets. He was most recently President and Chief Operating Officer of Journal Communications, where he was responsible for the company’s broadcasting and publishing assets.
“Andre is a terrific executive who brings a wealth of experience to this role – operations, financial management, programming and digital distribution, among many other attributes,” said Moonves. “He has had great success working in large and mid-sized markets, which has primed him to lead our major market operations. I’m confident Andre’s many qualities will make him a superb manager and help build upon an incredible foundation at CBS RADIO.”
“CBS is an exceptional media company, and this is a terrific opportunity to join a world-class operation and continue its growth and innovation,” said Fernandez. “I’m very impressed with not only CBS’s collection of market-leading brands, but the interface it has achieved with its complementary TV and digital assets, which gives us great opportunities for further development. I could not be more pleased to join this outstanding team.”
Fernandez succeeds Dan Mason, who announced his retirement earlier today after 17 years with the Company, during which he led CBS RADIO for a total of 15 years.
“Dan is a legendary leader in the radio business,” said Moonves. “His passion for the business is well-known, and is a major reason why he’s been able to turn around so many of our major market stations. Above all, he’s been a good friend and a superb colleague. We will miss him dearly and thank him very much.”
Previously, Fernandez served in several executive positions at Journal Communications, a publicly traded diversified media company. Named President in 2012 and Chief Operating Officer in 2014, Fernandez was responsible for operational oversight of Journal’s broadcast and publishing segments, as well as a number of corporate functions. He also served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer from 2008 through 2014.
Prior to Journal, Fernandez held a variety of financial leadership roles at the General Electric Company. Following GE/NBC’s acquisition of the Telemundo Communications Group in 2001, Fernandez was named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Telemundo, where he helped steer the company to its best financial performance in history. During his tenure, Fernandez also led the acquisitions of Telemundo-RTI Studios and Tepuy International and helped create the Yahoo!Telemundo digital joint venture. Prior to Telemundo, Fernandez held the positions of Chief Financial Officer and Controller of GE Latin America, based in Mexico City; Chief Financial Officer of GE’s Digital Energy business, based in Atlanta; Assistant Treasurer of GE Corporate Treasury and Chief Financial Officer of GE Capital Information Technology Solutions (ITS), both based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Before joining General Electric, Fernandez was FP&A and Treasury Manager for the United Technologies Corporation in both the U.S. and Brazil. Fernandez began his career on Wall Street, first as a banking associate with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York and then as Assistant Vice President with Merrill Lynch’s emerging markets group in both New York and London. He is fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese.
A New York native, Fernandez graduated cum laude from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. He currently serves on the boards of the Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) and Froedtert Health, an academic medical center and regional hospital system in southeast Wisconsin, where he is Vice Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Finance Committee and Member of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee. He is a member of the Greater Milwaukee Committee (GMC) and is also an active alumni interviewer for Harvard University.

CBS Radio Chief Andre Fernandez Grades His First 10 Months on the Job

John Paul Filo/CBS 
Andre J. Fernandez







While working for General Electric in Mexico and Brazil, Andre Fernandez relied on local radio to help him become fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, not to mention developing his passion for bossa nova music. So it’s fitting that, as president of CBS Radio, he now oversees a group that encompasses 117 stations in 26 markets. Sadly, he notes with a laugh, none play bossa nova.At just 47, Fernandez has already held senior executive positions at Telemundo, United Technologies Corp., GE and, most recently, Journal Communications, where he served as president/COO until taking the helm of CBS Radio in April 2015. In his first 10 months on the job, Fernandez says he has worked to create “more of a culture of innovation and risk-taking,” something he thinks the radio industry as a whole needs considerably more of. That helped earn him a spot on Billboard's recently published 2016 Power 100 list.No. 42: Andre J. Fernandez | Billboard Power 100As the diversity of his résumé can attest, Fernandez believes in reinventing himself professionally every so often. “I’ve had to do that many times in my career,” he says. “I’ve worked in a lot of different industries and a lot of different countries and companies and settings, and that requires that you’re constantly making adjustments and taking risks and having to — in a way —re-create yourself over and over again. It certainly gets tiring, but it probably allowed me to get to this point at this age in my career, and it’s exciting and challenging.”Raised in Brooklyn as the son of a professional musician father and dancer mother, Fernandez earned an economics degree at Harvard before launching his career on Wall Street, first as a banking associate with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York and then as assistant vp for Merrill Lynch, working in both New York and London. He currently resides in Connecticut with his wife and their three children.What is the biggest issue facing the radio business?This industry needs to continue to innovate. When I look at a lot of the streaming services and a lot of digital development, I’m actually surprised sometimes that more hasn’t been done or developed by traditional over-the-air broadcasters … They need to invest more in R&D and to experiment and, for some reason, they don’t or they haven’t … Companies need to have the courage to plow profits back into R&D and, if they do, I think they can ensure their future.That’s probably the biggest issue that I see. Having come from GE, a large industrial company where [research and development] and what we used to call “NPI” — new product introduction — are just so key to your business, and where many millions of dollars are spent every year, I just don’t see that as much or, at times, at all in this industry, and I think the industry needs it.What is one industry prediction you have for 2016?I wouldn’t be surprised if eventually you saw a merger among the streaming companies [or] an acquisition or a merger between a pure streaming company and a traditional over-the-air broadcaster. The streaming companies have gotten very creative in innovating things digitally that over-the-air broadcasters probably should have done, but certainly could learn from. So I wouldn’t be surprised if you saw either a merger among streamers or some over-the-air/streaming combinations.Is that something you’re looking to do at CBS?I don’t think so, because I’ve been very pleased with our digital efforts. [There was] a decision some six [or] seven years ago at CBS to combine the digital efforts of local television and our radio business in a single group, and that’s our CBS Local Digital Media. So my digital efforts sit between TV and radio, and they’re two [or] three hundred people strong. They’re some of the most creative people that I’ve ever worked with.In most markets, or nearly all in which we operate, we’re clearly the digital leaders because [of] that step years ago … I feel like I’ve been handed something very valuable here. We are very far ahead in terms of our digital efforts.If you could rate yourself on the first 10 months on the job, what are some things that you are most proud of having accomplished at CBS so far?There are a lot of things that I needed to focus my time on inward to make us a better business. Those things included improving certain processes, making sure that we had a better overall operating rigor, that there was bettercommunication among the different team members and constituents on the team, better transparency, faster decisions, clarity of decision-making. I also think that we’ve got a clear, more concise business strategy too. There’s now a culture where people can express their point of view, take some risks, take chances. Is there more of that to come, or will the next year shift your focus from looking inward to looking outward?There was a lot of that in the beginning that needed to get done. Now we can shift externally and execute more on our strategy … It frees me up to be much more externally focused.What is one of your leadership philosophies?So much depends on your reputation; guard it with your life. I work and lead by the highest standards of ethics and honesty, and I expect that of my team. I got some of the greatest compliments at my last company, Journal, when we were sold [to the E.W. Scripps Company] and a number of board of directors members told me when I was leaving, “You were always true to your word, and we never felt nervous or had any surprises with you, because you always did exactly what you said you were going to do. The company performed always how you said it was going to perform and, because of that, we always felt that we were in good hands.”Is there anything you collect as a hobby?I’m at a phase of my life where I’m un-collecting. I want more simplicity. I think in this era, people just amass too many things. I actually don’t think it’s healthy. You spend so much of your time in your life collecting and managing and caring for the things you’re collecting. I wonder if that’s really time well spent. This article first appeared in Billboard's Country Update -- sign up here.
