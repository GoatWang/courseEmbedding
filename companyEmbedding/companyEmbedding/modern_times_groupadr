Company structure[edit]
Since July 2015, MTG's digital presence was expanded through a number of acquisitions. MTG bought 74% of the shares in Turtle Entertainment, the company that runs Electronic Sports League (ESL), an eSports tournament organiser and followed up that acquisition with a further investment in Splay, Scandinavia's largest Multi-channel network, going from 49% to 81% of the shares in the company. MTG then acquired 51% of the shares in Zoomin.TV, Europe's largest MCN and the 5th largest network on YouTube. Also very recently, MTG made the acquisition of 100% of DreamHack, one of the biggest eSports tournament organisers in the world.
Advertising funded television (Free-TV)[edit]
MTG operates advertising funded channels in Scandinavia, Bulgaria, and the Baltic countries. Typically, the portfolio structure for these channels is one primary channel (TV3, Nova), and then secondary channels (TV6, TV3+, Diema etc...) These channels generate primarily advertising revenues, and are classified as free-TV, but a majority of the Scandinavian free-TV channels are encrypted and subject to decoding fees.

Company structure[edit]
Since July 2015, MTG's digital presence was expanded through a number of acquisitions. MTG bought 74% of the shares in Turtle Entertainment, the company that runs Electronic Sports League (ESL), an eSports tournament organiser and followed up that acquisition with a further investment in Splay, Scandinavia's largest Multi-channel network, going from 49% to 81% of the shares in the company. MTG then acquired 51% of the shares in Zoomin.TV, Europe's largest MCN and the 5th largest network on YouTube. Also very recently, MTG made the acquisition of 100% of DreamHack, one of the biggest eSports tournament organisers in the world.
Advertising funded television (Free-TV)[edit]
MTG operates advertising funded channels in Scandinavia, Bulgaria, and the Baltic countries. Typically, the portfolio structure for these channels is one primary channel (TV3, Nova), and then secondary channels (TV6, TV3+, Diema etc...) These channels generate primarily advertising revenues, and are classified as free-TV, but a majority of the Scandinavian free-TV channels are encrypted and subject to decoding fees.

Company structure[edit]
Since July 2015, MTG's digital presence was expanded through a number of acquisitions. MTG bought 74% of the shares in Turtle Entertainment, the company that runs Electronic Sports League (ESL), an eSports tournament organiser and followed up that acquisition with a further investment in Splay, Scandinavia's largest Multi-channel network, going from 49% to 81% of the shares in the company. MTG then acquired 51% of the shares in Zoomin.TV, Europe's largest MCN and the 5th largest network on YouTube. Also very recently, MTG made the acquisition of 100% of DreamHack, one of the biggest eSports tournament organisers in the world.
Advertising funded television (Free-TV)[edit]
MTG operates advertising funded channels in Scandinavia, Bulgaria, and the Baltic countries. Typically, the portfolio structure for these channels is one primary channel (TV3, Nova), and then secondary channels (TV6, TV3+, Diema etc...) These channels generate primarily advertising revenues, and are classified as free-TV, but a majority of the Scandinavian free-TV channels are encrypted and subject to decoding fees.
