Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for MSC Industrial Direct Company (NYSE:MSM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 8 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.29)Consensus Price Target: $91.42 (29.12% upside)

BorgWarner Inc. (BWA) Upgraded by Zacks Investment Research to “Hold”

Posted by Dan Jones on Jul 19th, 2017 // No Comments 

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research note issued to investors on Tuesday. 
According to Zacks, “High organic net sales growth expectations are likely to aid BorgWarner going forward. Huge business opportunities in Asia, the Americas and Europe in the next three years are anticipated to contribute to a major portion of growth. Also, a healthy balance sheet and ample cash flows help the company return capital to shareholders and undertake acquisitions. Moreover, BorgWarner is poised to benefit from its expansion strategy. BorgWarner has outperformed the Zacks categorized Auto/Truck Original Equipment industry in the last three months. However, the company is facing foreign currency headwinds and pressure from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to reduce prices, which might pose a threat to the company. Due to foreign currency fluctuations it might face a negative impact of upto $310 million in fiscal 2017.”
