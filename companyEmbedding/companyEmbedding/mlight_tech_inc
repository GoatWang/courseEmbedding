(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7 - Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.  The merger between mLight Tech, Inc. and The Ding King Training Institute, Inc. ("DKTI") has been accounted for as a recapitalization. DKTI was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and mLight is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the merger are those of DKTI. The assets and liabilities of mLight are recorded at their historical cost basis, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the merger include the assets and liabilities of DKTI and mLight, and the historical operations of DKTI and operations of the combined company from the closing date of the merger.  As used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term "Company", "it(s)", "our", "us", "we" and "mLight" shall mean mLight Tech, Inc., a Florida corporation, and its consolidated subsidiary.  Overview of the Business  As a result of our merger with Ding King Training Institute, Inc. on October 31, 2013, our business became the business of DKTI. DKTI is in the business of training individuals for a career as a technician in the Automotive Appearance Industry, which includes paintless dent repair, interior restoration, windshield repair, window detailing, odor removal, detailing and alloy wheel repair. The potential students are employees of auto body shops, car rental companies and car dealers as well as entrepreneurs looking to start their own businesses. DKTI is a California State Licensed Vocational School with the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education (BPPE #301591) and also authorized to sell business opportunities in the Automotive Appearance Training industry.  For the year ended September 30, 2016, DKTI graduated388 students with completion of 466 courses, as compared to graduating 208 students completing 262 courses in 2015, with the majority of students completed courses in paintless dent repair and interior restoration. DKTI offers its training courses at its corporate headquarters located in Costa Mesa, California, and at five satellite training locations in the states of Colorado, Texas, Missouri, South Carolina and Long Island, New York. No online classes are presently offered by DKTI. DKTI currently has five (5) non-employee instructors who teach the courses offered by DKTI.  Table of Contents  Financial Operations Overview  Results of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  The consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of DKTI and mLight for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Revenues for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2,560,473 and $1,681,541, respectively. Revenues comprised of training courses offered, sale of tools and accessories, and licensing income earned by marketing online trade name and shopping cart. Revenues increased in 2016 by $878,932 or 52% primarily due to the increase in student enrollments and training course completions during the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015. The Company increased its online marketing presence via pay per click advertising on Google and an increase in search engine optimization marketing caused the quantity of leads to increase, thus allowing us to generate more sales. Additionally, the Company had more students add on additional training packages to their core PDR Training program also helping to increase sales. The Company began offering PDR Training in Missouri, South Carolina, New Jersey, Colorado and Texas which was helpful in generating more mid-west customers who were able to drive to school and avoid the inconvenience of airports and other travel related expenses. As a result, during the year ended September 30, 2016, 388 students graduated who were enrolled in 466 training courses as compared to 208 students graduated enrolling in 262 courses in 2015. The Company recorded $1,667,089 in revenues earned from training courses completed in 2016 as compared to $1,026,787 in revenues earned from training courses completed for the same comparable period in 2015. The Company sold tools and accessories to its students and recorded $857,731 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $568,504 for the same comparable period in 2015. The Company recorded $23,750 in licensing income for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $86,250 for the same comparable period in 2015. The Company executed an exclusive license in 2013 and 2014 to an affiliated entity, Dent Tools Direct USA, Inc., to market online its trade name and shopping cart. This agreement expired on December 31, 2015 and was not extended or renewed. The Company also offered additional training courses in 2015 and 2016 which also helped in increasing enrollment of students resulting in an increase in training revenues. In addition, the Company recorded $11,902 in shipping income for sale of tools to its students for the year ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 in shipping income for the same comparable period in 2015.  Cost of sales for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,339,314 and $853,679, respectively. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 52% and 51% for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There are no direct costs associated with revenues derived from the licensing revenues.  Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,446,331 and $723,694, respectively. Operating expenses primarily consisted of selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses (S,G&A) for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1,443,324 and $721,533, respectively. S,G&A increased by $721,791 or 100% in 2016 primarily due to increase in legal and professional fees, compensation and consulting fees, advertising, rent and bad debt expense, and costs associated of being a public company. Management expects our costs to continue to fluctuate until we begin to generate a substantial increase in revenues.  Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $21,307 and $5,876, respectively. Interest expense increased by $15,431for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to prior year because on May 9, 2016, the Company executed a note payable to a bank and recorded $49,275 as a debt discount. The Company recorded interest expense of $14,932 as the amortization of debt discount for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $0 for the comparable periods of 2015. In addition, the Company negotiated the interest rate on the three promissory notes of $68,000, $50,000 and $15,000 from 10% per annum to 5% per annum. The Company made cash payments of $7,500 on the $15,000 promissory note in 2015, which resulted in reduction of interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As a result of the above explanations, the Company recorded a net loss of $247,279 for the year ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net income of $96,732 for the same comparable period in 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have recorded a net loss of $247,279 for the year ended September 30, 2016 and net cash used in operating activities was $121,888. In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of $736,912 and working capital deficiency of $732,819 as of September 30, 2016. Management's plans include generating income by offering additional training courses to cover operating costs to generate sufficient cash flows and raise funds by issuing debt securities to continue as a going concern. Management has successfully negotiated an agreement with a debt holder to extend the due date of $125,500 promissory notes to December 31, 2017. There is no assurance these plans will be realized.  Table of Contents  Operating activities  Net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 was $121,888, primarily due to the net loss of $247,279, depreciation and amortization expense of $3,007, amortization of debt discount of $14,932, bad debt expense of $121,832, increase in accounts receivable of $65,252, increase in security deposit of $4,486, increase in bank overdraft of $13,452, increase in accounts payable of $75,194, decrease in accrued expenses of $9,805, increase in accrued interest of $6,275, decrease in refundable deposits of $2,000, decrease in deferred revenue of $23,750, and decrease in purchase commitments of $4,008.  Investing activities  Net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 was $2,636 due to the acquisition of property and equipment.  Financing activities  Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 was $124,524 principally due to the cash proceeds from loan payable of $109,500, repayment of loan payable of $49,076, and cash received from officer of $64,100 for working capital needs of the Company.  As a result of the above activities, we experienced a net decrease in cash of $0 for the year ended September 30, 2016. Cash balance at September 30, 2016was $0as we were overdrawn in our bank account by $15,153.  To date, we have financed our operations primarily through borrowings from our President/ Chief Executive Officer and more recently by executing promissory notes for our working capital requirements. Our working capital and other capital requirements for the next twelve months to bring our proposed training programs to commercial viability will vary based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to obtaining approvals from various states to open new training schools in their states, and signing up for federally funded programs to open training schools. However, because several factors related to the growth of our operations remain outside of our control e.g. timing of the approvals by states for us to open training schools, there can be no assurance we will achieve commercial viability. Due to the limited funds available, the Company has partnered with its former students to act as instructors in Missouri and Texas, and sub-leasing their facilities to offer training courses to students.  We believe that funds generated from our operations, plus those we have raised from borrowings will not be sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months. However, it is possible that we will not be able to maintain our training programs and other services through such period or we will not raise sufficient additional funds from borrowings to cover operational expenses. Under those circumstances, we will need to obtain additional funding to support our operations. Because we have no contractual commitments with respect to any of these initiatives, there can be no assurance that additional funds for operations will be available on commercially reasonable terms or in the necessary amounts. Our inability to obtain any needed additional financing would have a material adverse effect on us, including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail our operations.  Effects of Inflation  We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and judgments related to the application of certain accounting policies.  While we base our estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to our reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and (ii) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have material impact on our financial statements.  Table of Contents  We consider our policy for revenue recognition due to the continuously evolving standards and industry practices related to revenue recognition, wherein any changes could materially impact the way we report revenues. Accounting policies related to income taxes are also considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management for the valuation allowances associated with our deferred tax assets. Critical accounting policies and our procedures related to these policies are described below.  Revenue Recognition  The Company's tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the Company's tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the students. Upon commencement of the courses, the Company recognizes as revenue any deposits previously received, as they are non-refundable upon commencement of the courses. The remaining tuition from the student or the student's employer, which is received upon the commencement of the course or extended credit over a period of one to three months or as agreed upon, is recognized as revenue upon the completion of the training courses. The training course duration is from one to two weeks.  The Company's revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. The criteria and how the Company satisfies each element are as follows: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement - the Company and the student or the student's employer (the customer) enters into a signed contract with the Company; (2) delivery has occurred - as noted above, upon the commencement of the course, the deposit is non-refundable per the terms of the signed contract and upon completion of the course, the Company has provided all services to be delivered to the student under the contract; (3) the price is fixed and determinable - the signed contract indicates a fixed dollar amount for the tuition for the courses enrolled by the student; (4) collectability is reasonable assured - the Company receives as payment a deposit and the balance of the tuition before the course is completed, or credit is extended for installment payments, as evidenced by promissory note not to exceed one year.  The Company records licensing revenue by granting an annual exclusive license to sell Dent Tools Direct, USA Inc. ("Dent Tools") merchandise online under the Ding King name and logo on the DKTI website. The Company recognizes licensing revenue ratably monthly as the Company earns revenue and satisfies conditions for recognition of revenues.  Environmental Matters  Our operations are subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations related to the discharge of materials into the environment. Our process is not expected to produce harmful levels of emissions or waste by-products. However, these laws and regulations would require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of substances at our site should they occur. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly. Additionally, governmental authorities may enforce the laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties and remediation requirements. We are not aware of any area of non-compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations as of the date of this report. Management has not recorded a reserve for any contingencies related to this area, however that is based on management current understanding of the applicable laws and regulations that are subject to interpretation by the regulatory authorities.  Income Taxes  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting requirements and those imposed under federal and state tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided for timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expenses for income tax and financial reporting purposes and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Table of Contents  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 of our Financial Statements included in this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

	mLight Tech, Inc.




	(A Development Stage Company)






	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(June 30, 2013)




	(unaudited)







	NOTE 1.  GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS






	mLight Tech, Inc. is a development stage company, incorporated in the State of Florida on September 3, 2010, to provide software solutions that simplify the management of networked personal computers.  mLight plans to develop products to automate network inventory and reporting, diagramming and documentation, problem identification and resolution, and compliance.





	The Company’s products are planned help design, discover, document and manage distributed personal computer networks. Through a combination of integrated functionality and powerful data management capability, mLight plans to create products to allow organizations to better manage their PC networks, thereby reducing their total cost of ownership. mLight products will be specifically targeted at small to medium size networks in medium to large companies.





	mLight Tech, Inc. is in the early stage of developing its business plan. The Company does not have any products or customers and has not generated any revenues. The Company must complete the business plan, develop the product and attract customers before it can start generating revenues.





	Through June 30, 2013 the Company was in the development stage and has not carried on any significant operations and has generated minimal revenues. The Company has incurred losses since inception totaling $29,844. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period.  Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Interim Financial Statements






	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2012 and notes thereto and other pertinent information contained in our Annual Form 10-K the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.





	The results of operations for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2013.






	Development Stage Entity






	The Company is a development stage company as defined by section FASB ASC 915,

	Development Stage Entities

	.  The Company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company’s development stage activities.





	- 7 -









	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	The Company follows ASC 305-10,

	Cash and Cash Equivalents,

	and considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,958 and $53 at June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012, respectively.






	Earnings (Loss) per Share






	The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.  As of June 30, 2013 and 2012, there were no common stock equivalents or options outstanding.






	Dividends






	The Company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends. No dividends have been paid during the periods shown, and none are contemplated in the near future.






	Deferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 “Income Taxes.”  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs.  A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.  No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of June 30, 2013 or June 30, 2012 respectively.






	Advertising






	No advertising costs were incurred for the periods ending June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012.






	Related parties






	The Company follows ASC 850,

	Related Party Disclosures

	for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.  Related party transactions for the periods ending June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012 totaled $0.






	Share-based Expenses.






	ASC 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired.  Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options,  and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights.  Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).





	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50, “

	Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees.”

	 Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:  (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.  The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.





	There were no share-based expenses for the periods ending June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012.





	- 8 -









	Financial Instruments






	The Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.





	ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:














	·




	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities






	 




	 






	·




	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.






	 




	 






	·




	Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.








	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of June 30, 2013. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.






	NOTE 3:  GOING CONCERN:






	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred losses of $29,844 since its inception, has not yet produced revenues from operations, and has a working capital deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.





	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that it will be able to raise additional working capital through the issuance of stock and through additional loans and advances from investors.





	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to attain a satisfactory level of profitability and obtain suitable and adequate financing. There can be no assurance that management’s plan will be successful.






	NOTE 4:  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	Except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws and a limited number of grandfathered standards, the

	FASB Accounting Standards Codification™

	(“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative GAAP literature recognized by the FASB and applicable to the Company.





	We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.

	NOTE 5.  NOTES PAYABLE






	In September 2012, the company issued a note payable in the amount of $1,000 to a related party.  In October 2012, the company issued a second note payable also in the amount of $1,000 and to the same unrelated party.  On January 3, 2013, February 6, 2013, and June 5, 2013 the Company issued notes payable in the amounts of $4,000, $1,000, and $3,000 respectively to the same related party.  All the notes accrue interest at 5% and are due on demand.   Notes payable totaled $10,000 and $1,000 at June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012, respectively.






	NOTE 6.  STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY



	 



	Common Stock



	 


	There are 300,000,000 Common Shares at $0.0001 par value authorized with 204,000,000 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.





	On September 3, 2010, the Company issued 180,000,000 (post split) of its $0.0001 par value common stock at $0.0001 per share for $9,000 cash to the founder of the Company. The issuance of the shares was made to the sole officer and director of the Company and an individual who is a sophisticated and accredited investor, therefore, the issuance was exempt from registration of the Securities Act of 1933 by reason of Section 4 (2) of that Act.





	On January 31, 2012, the Company issued 24,000,000 common shares at $0.0005 per share yielding net proceeds of $12,000.





	On February 8, 2013, the Company’s board of directors authorized a 20 for 1 forward split.  The record date of the split was February 26, 2013 and the effective date was February 27, 2013.   After the split, the total outstanding shares were 204,000,000.








	NOTE 7.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued. Based on our evaluation the following events have occurred requiring adjustment or disclosure:





	On August 1, 2013, Todd Sudeck, the sole director and officer of mLight Tech, Inc. (the “Company”), acquired a total 180,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Edward Sanders, the Company’s former director and officer, in a private transaction.  Mr. Sudeck’s 180,000,000 shares amount to approximately 88.2% of the Company’s currently issued and outstanding common stock.





	On August 6, 2013, the Company entered into a Letter of Intent whereby the Company was to acquire 100% of all of the capital stock of The Ding King Training Institute, Inc., in exchange for two million five hundred thousand shares of the issued and outstanding common stock (“Acquisition Shares”) of the Company.  The Acquisition Shares will be deposited in an escrow account and released to The Ding King shareholders upon the Closing Event and the satisfaction of certain post-closing requirements as defined in the definitive agreements.  The proposed merger is contingent on the audit of The Ding King Training Institute, Inc. and is expected to close by August 30, 2013.

	Critical Accounting Policies






	We prepare our condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.  On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our condensed financial statements.





	While we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.





	For a full description of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.









	ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.






	Not applicable to a smaller reporting company.









	ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

	We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on his evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our President, who serves as both our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.






	Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:














	·




	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;






	 




	 






	·




	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and








	- 12 -

















	·




	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.








	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.





	As of June 30, 2013 management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.





	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members; lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliation; and, management dominated by a single individual/small group without adequate compensating controls. . The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of June 30, 2013.





	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.






	Management’s Remediation Initiatives






	In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:





	We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.





	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.





	We anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by December 31, 2013. Additionally, we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies by December 31, 2013.






	Changes in internal controls over financial reporting






	There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  As used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term "Company", "it(s)", "our", "us", "we" and "mLight" shall mean mLight Tech, Inc., a Florida corporation, and its consolidated subsidiary.  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing in the 2016 Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 13, 2017 and elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events.  Overview of the Business  As a result of our merger with Ding King Training Institute, Inc. ("DKTI") on October 31, 2013, our business became the business of DKTI. DKTI is in the business of training individuals for a career as a technician in the Automotive Appearance Industry, which includes paint less dent repair, interior restoration, windshield repair, window detailing, odor removal, detailing and alloy wheel repair. The potential students are employees of auto body shops, car rental companies and car dealers as well as entrepreneurs looking to start their own businesses. DKTI is a California State Licensed Vocational School with the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education (BPPE #301591) and also authorized to sell business opportunities in the Automotive Appearance Training industry.  For the three months ended December 31, 2016, DKTI graduated 79 students with completion of 97 courses, as compared to graduating 63 students completing 75 courses in the same comparable period of 2015, with the majority of the students completed courses in paint less dent repair and interior restoration. DKTI offers its training courses at its corporate headquarters located in Costa Mesa, California, and at six satellite training locations in the states of Colorado, Texas, Missouri, New Jersey, South Carolina and Long Island, New York. No online classes are presently offered by DKTI. DKTI currently has five (5) non-employee instructors who teach the courses offered by DKTI on an as needed basis depending upon the demand for the courses.  Table of Contents  DKTI offers the following courses at the tuition rates include a $75 registration fee and all tools and equipment necessary, where applicable:  Paintless Dent Repair ("PDR") - The objective of the PDR course is to provide intensive training to an individual who has the goal to continue  SMART Paint Repair - The objective of the SMART Paint Repair program is to provide extensive training to an individual who has the goal to properly  Chip King - The objective of the Chip King course is to provide training  Interior Restoration - The objective of the Interior Restoration course is to teach each student the correct principles in repairing all types of  Windshield Repair - The objective of the Windshield Repair course is to teach each student the correct skills and principles in repairing various  Window Tinting - The objective of the Window Tinting course is to teach  Detailing - The objective of the Detailing course is to provide extensive intensive training to an individual who has the goal to properly estimate and detail a vehicle from start to finish. The student will also receive on-going technical support by phone. This program is designed to provide  Odor Removal - The objective of the Odor Removal course is to teach the student correct principles in odor removal from a vehicle. The Odor  Alloy Wheel Repair - The objective of the Alloy Wheel Repair course is to provide extensive and intensive training to an individual who has the goal  Table of Contents  Financial Operations Overview  Results of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016.  The consolidated results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included the results of operations of DKTI and mLight Tech.  Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $663,461 and 564,669, respectively. Revenues primarily comprised of training courses and tools and accessories offered to the students and licensing income earned by marketing online trade name and shopping cart. Revenues for the three months increased in 2016 by $98,793 or 17% primarily due to the increase in student enrollments and training course completions during the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The Company increased its online marketing presence via pay per click advertising on Google and an increase in search engine optimization marketing caused the quantity of leads to increase, thus allowing us to generate more sales. Additionally, the Company had more students add on additional training packages to their core PDR Training program also helping to increase sales. The Company began offering PDR Training in Missouri, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Texas which was helpful in generating more mid-west customers who were able to drive to school and avoid the inconvenience of airports and other travel related expenses. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, 79 students graduated who were enrolled in 97 training courses as compared to 63 students graduated enrolling in 75 courses in the same comparable period in 2015. As a result, the Company recorded $413,193 in revenues earned from training courses completed in 2016 and $242,689 from the sale of tools and accessories as compared to $362,700 in revenues earned from training courses completed and $178,219 from the sale of tools and accessories for the same comparable period in 2015. The Company recorded $0 in licensing income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $23,750 in licensing income for the same comparable three months period ended in 2015. The Company executed an exclusive license in 2013 and 2014 with an affiliated entity, Dent Tools Direct USA, Inc., to market online its trade name and shopping cart. This agreement expired on December 31, 2015 and was not extended or renewed. The Company also offered additional training courses in 2015 and 2016 which also helped in increasing enrollment of students resulting in an increase in training revenues. In addition, the Company recorded $7,579 in shipping income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $0 in shipping income for the same comparable period in 2015.  Cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $322,096 and $259,341, respectively. Cost of sales as a percentage of tuition revenue was 49% for 2016 and 46% for 2015. The Company offered discounted pricing for additional courses to students in both 2016 and 2015, and increased the number of instructors while the student enrollment increased in 2016. The Company kept the same number instructors in 2015 while the student enrollment increased. As a result, students to instructor ratio decreased, which increased the cost of sales as a percentage of tuition revenue in 2016 over 2015. There are no direct costs associated with revenues derived from our licensing revenues.  Table of Contents  Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 were $292,862 compared to $205,552 for the same comparable period in 2015. Operating expenses primarily consist of selling, general and administrative expense ("S,G&A"). S,G&A increased by $87,266 or 43% in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to increase in sales and marketing promotions expense incurred by the Company to enroll new students, increase in payroll expenses due to new hires and increase in trade shows expense, increase in administrative and consulting expenses, increase in provision for bad debts, and increase in legal and professional fees. Management expects our costs to continue to fluctuate until we begin to generate substantial increase in revenues.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $763 and $719, respectively.  Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $11,125 as compared to $1,569 for the same comparable period in 2015. Interest expense increased by $9,556 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to prior year comparable period in 2015 because on May 9, 2016, the Company executed a note payable to a bank and recorded $49,275 as a debt discount. The Company recorded interest expense of $9,556 as the amortization of debt discount for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $0 for the comparable period of 2015. In addition, the Company renegotiated the interest rate on the three promissory notes of $68,000, $50,000 and $15,000 from 10% per annum to 5% per annum. The Company made cash payment of $7,500 on the $15,000 promissory note in 2015, which offset the overall increase of interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to comparable period in 2015.  As a result of the above explanations, the Company recorded a net income of $37,378 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net income of $103,032 for the same comparable period in 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The accompanying consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 have been prepared on a basis that contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have recorded a net income of $37,378 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and net cash flows provided by operating activities were $13,939. In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of $699,534 and a working capital deficiency of $678,884 as of December 31, 2016. Management's plans include generating income by offering additional training courses to cover operating costs to generate sufficient cash flows and raise capital by borrowing and/or sale of common shares to continue as a going concern. Management has successfully negotiated an agreement with a debt holder to extend the due date of payment of promissory notes to December 31, 2017. There is no assurance these plans will be realized.  Table of Contents  Operating Activities  Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $13,939, primarily due to the net income of $37,378, depreciation and amortization expense of $763, amortization of debt discount of $9,556, bad debt expense of $19,055, decrease in accounts receivable of $32,378, decrease in bank overdraft of $13,558, decrease in accounts payable of $49,876, decrease in accrued expenses of $20,735, increase in accrued interest of $1,568, and decrease in purchase commitments of $2,590.  Investing Activities  Net cash flows used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $0.  Financing Activities  Net cash flows used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $13,939 due to the cash payments of $31,274 on loan payable, and $17,335 cash advanced by the officer for the Company's working capital requirements.  As a result of the above activities, we did not experience a change in cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Cash balance at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016 were $0 as we were overdrawn in our bank account.  To date, we have financed our operations primarily through borrowings from our President/ Chief Executive Officer and more recently by executing promissory notes for our working capital requirements. Our working capital and other capital requirements for the next twelve months to bring our proposed training programs to commercial viability will vary based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to obtaining approvals from various states to open new training schools in their states, and signing up for federally funded programs to open training schools. However, because several factors related to the growth of our operations remain outside of our control e.g. timing of the approvals by states for us to open training schools, there can be no assurance we will achieve commercial viability. Due to the limited funds available, the Company has partnered with its former students to act as instructors in Missouri and Texas, and using their facilities to offer training courses to students.  We believe that funds generated from our operations, plus those we have raised from borrowings will not be sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months. However, it is possible that we will not be able to maintain our training programs and other services through such period or we will not raise sufficient additional funds from borrowings or sale of our common stock to cover operational expenses. Under those circumstances, we will need to obtain additional funding to support our operations. Because we have no contractual commitments with respect to any of these initiatives, there can be no assurance that additional funds for operations will be available on commercially reasonable terms or in the necessary amounts. Our inability to obtain any needed additional financing would have a material adverse effect on us, including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail our operations.  Table of Contents  Effects of Inflation  We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and judgments related to the application of certain accounting policies.  While we base our estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider accounting estimates to be critical to our reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and (ii) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have material impact on our financial statements.  We consider our policy for revenue recognition due to the continuously evolving standards and industry practices related to revenue recognition, wherein any changes could materially impact the way we report revenues. Accounting policies related to income taxes are also considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. Critical accounting policies and our procedures related to these policies are described below.  Revenue Recognition  The Company's tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the students. Upon commencement of the courses, the Company recognizes as revenue any deposits previously received, as they are non-refundable upon commencement of the courses. The remaining tuition from the student or the student's employer, which is received upon the commencement of the course or extended credit over a period of one to three months, is recognized as revenue upon the completion of the training courses, the duration of which is one to two weeks.  The Company's revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. The criteria and how the Company satisfies each element are as follows: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement - the Company and the student or the student's employer (the customer) enters into a signed contract with the Company; (2) delivery has occurred - as noted above, upon the commencement of the course, the deposit is non-refundable per the terms of the signed contract and upon completion of the course, the Company has provided all services to be delivered to the student under the contract; (3) the price is fixed and determinable - the signed contract indicates a fixed dollar amount for the tuition for the courses enrolled by the student; (4) collectability is reasonable assured - the Company receives as payment a deposit and the balance of the tuition before the course is completed, or credit is extended for installment payments, as evidenced by promissory note not to exceed one year.  Table of Contents  Environmental Matters  Our operations are subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations related to the discharge of materials into the environment. Our process is not expected to produce harmful levels of emissions or waste by-products. However, these laws and regulations would require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of substances at our site should they occur. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly. Additionally, governmental authorities may enforce the laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures, including monetary penalties and remediation requirements. We are not aware of any area of non-compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations as of the date of this report. Management has not recorded a reserve for any contingencies related to this area, however that is based on management current understanding of the applicable laws and regulations that are subject to interpretation by the regulatory authorities.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2 of our Financial Statements included in this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

Rivervue Retirement Village - mlight










































 



































Rivervue Retirement Village
Avondale Heights

When approaching our work installing the lighting in the reception and pool area of the Rivervue Retirement Village, creating a warm and comforting environment was of great importance. Using the Advance LED as our luminaire of choice in recessed fittings, we created a slick solution that highlighted the key focal points, such as the TV, while simultaneously illuminating the workspace. For the pool area, we were able to build the fittings into an angular shape so the recessed Advance could run along the entire perimeter. The result is an even, soft glow across the entire space, providing optimal illumination with that original pleasant, relaxing vibe.

EF International - mlight LED kleo










































 



































EF International
Sydney, New South Wales

EF International’s new space in Balfour St, Sydney features a very modern, Scandinavian style in its interior design, and crafting a lighting solution for it would mean understanding its strengths.
The answer? It’s simple, yet striking, and that’s exactly what we achieved with our LED Kleo luminaire.
Outkast created some stunning shapes by criss-crossing wire suspended Kleos in the kitchen and work area, and spiced things up a bit by creating some diamond shaped fittings to surround the drop down lights in the main foyer. The Kleo’s powerful beam makes the trendy furnishings shine while the fittings make for beautiful display across the ceiling.

Genesiscare LED lighting - mlight










































 



































GenesisCare
Alexandria NSW

Working with engineers from Evolved Engineering on the GenesisCare building gave us the perfect opportunity to show off our most creative luminaire yet, the Swerve.
The Swerve allowed us to do what was once thought impossible and match the curvature of the space, creating a wide, semi-circle perimeter light surrounding a stunning complete circle in the centre. Both are wire suspended and cast light down into the space and up toward the ceiling, projecting their own subtle glowing rings.
Evolved Engineering pride themselves on their creative, unique designs, and with our Swerve luminaires we were able to realise those ideas with ease.

Taking creativity to a new level, the Swerve bends minds. Allowing a huge leap in customisation, curved lighting is one of the fastest growing design trends, the curved luminaire broadens possibilities for designers and architects to create beautifully lit spaces.
Until recently this product was believed to be impossible, obstacles in the development of the Swerve proving too big a challenge for our design team. However with determination, ingenuity and technological advancements in manufacturing, these obstacles have been tossed aside and the Swerve was created.

Unispace Melbourne - Mlight Swerve










































 



































Unispace
Melbourne

The Unispace office is a hive of creative thinking, where talented designers strive to find new and unique ways to meet the needs of their clients. Unispace wanted to come up with a lighting solution for their Melbourne head office to match their thinking-outside-of-the-box approach to their work.  NDYLIGHT worked collaboratively with Unispace to provide a curvaceous lighting design that broke free of the straight-line approach to office lighting. We at mLight, introduced the Swerve LED system to the team and the flexibility of the system and mLights commitment to delivering on the vision allowed the design to be realised in full.  As well as being a powerful luminaire, the Swerve is an interior designer’s dream, being fully customisable to any space. We can curve both the fitting and the LED in any number of shapes, which is how we created the stunning Y-joins seen at Unispace.  Swerve’s flexibility allowed us to outline the work spaces around the office, providing a bright space to facilitate their designers’ bright thoughts and unifying the furnishings with the interior architecture. The shiny finish on the ceiling also resulted in a gorgeous, electrifying reflection of the installation.  Our Swerve LED is here to inspire creative minds, from interior designers to those under its beam. It’s the new box to think outside of.
