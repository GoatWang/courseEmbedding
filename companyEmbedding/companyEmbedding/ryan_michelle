VALUES
 

We understand that insurance can be viewed as a commodity, bought from anyone or even online. In reality there are limitless strategies and choices depending on particular goals, and there is value in a trusted advisor. Why work with Hillenbrand & Company?

Strategy – We are insurance brokers who work with business owners and professionals that seek the security and peace of mind provided by a strategic insurance plan. We are committed to understanding our clients’ needs then creating a customized plan which integrates with their financial goals and mitigates risk.

Experience – A 46 year tenure of working with families and businesses in the St. Louis area, guiding them through all stages of life and growth.

Performance – Our specialized focus is on what we do best, not trying to cover all insurance products on the market. This has earned recognition and membership in some of our industry’s top associations such as Million Dollar Roundtable, Leading Producers Roundtable, among others. We’ve accomplished this by earning our clients’ trust and offering excellent service.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Learning ProductUnder the surfaceLearning ProductMain Question: How are programs such as SNUG, a social service created for sex workers in Edmonton, addressing the diverse issues of prostitution?Why my Interest?I first became interested in the issues of Prostitution when I watched a documentary that explored the lives of sex workers in the Edmonton area. I had very little information about these organizations so I decided to do some research! My learning product will illustrate what I have learned throughout this process. Sub Questions:What is Project SNUG?Why is such an organization needed?What are the strategies used to help the targeted population?Are there other social programs being created?What are the public attitudes towards prostitution?Are there any action in decriminalizing prostitution?Are there any influential factors that causes a person to become involved in prostitution?How is prostitution addressed in other countries?Trailer for the documentary "Who Cares" By Rosie DransfieldFunding For Project SNUG"A large portion of SNUG's funding is received through private donations and leveraging funds from other programs to cover staffing wages" (Gov. of Canada, Justice Department)What strategies do these organizations use to help the targeted population?Organizations that focus on helping sex workers have many commonalities. Such include: outreach programs; provision of basic necessities; counseling services; life education/coaching; and detox opportunities.Why are such strategies used?Outreach programs offer direct information about accessing services and supports that can help the targeted population. An outreach program also serves as a service to those who may not have a way of transportation to such services and supports. Providing the targeted population with basic necessities is key. Many street workers experience homelessness and do not have access to many of these basic necessities i.e. clean clothes, showers, fresh food... Counseling services are necessary when working with this population. Sex workers often turn to prostitution as a means of escaping inner emotional turmoil. Being able to work through their emotional trauma is very important when rebuilding their well-being.Life education/coaching is very important when trying to help sex workers gain life skills for when they leave their profession. Detox opportunities are necessary when helping these individuals leave prostitution. Prostitution can be a vicious cycle where addiction fuels the choice of going back to the streets. What are the historical and present legal actions towards prostitution?Beginning with Historical...In the year 1958 the United Nation passed a verdict that identified prostitution as a non criminal act (Aggleton, 1999). This resulted in Canada adopting a legal stance on prostitution. But, even though prostitution is not illegal in Canada there are many laws that can be easily crossed when pursuing sex work. For example: The communication for the purposes of prostitution is illegal. This action consists of a sex worker talking openly with a client about the exchange of money for sex. "Public places include: vehicles, parking lots, restaurants/bars, hotel lobbies, streets, or any place that the public has access to or that the public can view" ("Canada's current prostitution," ). Such laws are close to impossible for sex workers to avoid! These laws also corner sex workers into areas that are very unsafe and high risk!Optional legal action towards prostitutionThe John Howard Society (2001) proposes three options for the legislation of prostitution to change. First we could further criminalized prostitution with more intense 'crack down' procedures towards anyone participating in the act. Second, we could decriminalize prostitution which would be the complete removal of illegal labels on prostitution acts. Third, we could regulate prostitution. Regulating would provide safer environments and practices of prostitution. Conclusions about the Inquiry ProcessI found the inquiry process to be quite informative. I appreciate the idea of deductive learning, as it provides me to dig deep into my research. Emergent Questions the during the inquiry processSince I did not get a chance to answer all of my sub-questions I would still like to find the information regarding each. Especially what other countries do to work with the issues of prostitution! I think it would be interesting to see the diversity between each. What did I learn from completing my learning product?I learned a ton of information about the sex worker population. I do feel a real passion for working with these individuals. I also found that the organizations that are being used to work with this population have really put a lot of time and thought into how their programs will operate. For example, having an outreach program is amazing! This is such a hands on delivery of helping sex workers cope or leave the streets. Conclusion- In short, Prostitutes need help. Project SNUG and similar social outreach programs are vital for helping these individuals deal with the dangers of their work as well as providing "ways out" of prostitution.- Likewise, Canadian legislation should be implemented to help these individuals by making prostitution safer.- It is fairly clear that prostitution prohibition is not effective--you just can't stop it. Prostitution is often referred as "the world's oldest profession" for a reason. Anti-prostitution laws places the state against prostitutes and denies them the help they need. -Organizations that advocate for sex workers are needed in Canada. What are some areas that I would like to learn about organizations?I would like to learn more about the funding process within organizations. Throughout this program funding has been emphasized, therefore I would like to expand my knowledge base. References:Aggleton, P. (1999). Men who sell sex. London: UCL Press.Boritch, H. (1997).

A public opinion issue review: legalizing prostitution. jenkins research, Retrieved from http://www.jenkinsresearch.ca/library/Jenkins-2010-IssueReview-Prostitution.pdfPlease note* The documentary I viewed gave insight on project KARE in Edmonton. Both project KARE and SNUG are very similar but differ in availability of information. This difference led me to focus more on project SNUG..What is Project SNUG?Project SNUG continued...SNUG was initiated through the support of two foundational community partners in Edmonton: "PAAFE "(Prostitution Action and Awareness Foundation of Edmonton--A community organized, not for profit group of dedicated people whose goal is to provide intervention, relief, training, and education for street prostitutes), and Safedmonton (Safedmonton is a collaborative initiative of the City of Edmonton. Partners include representatives from health, education, law enforcement, business, security and social services and volunteer and community organizations)" (Nowlen, 2007, p. 3). The Edmonton Police Services (EPS) searched for further support through agencies that could help provide "temporary shelters, food, medical help, and miscellaneous products such as cigarettes, diapers, baby formula, and personal hygiene products" (Nowlan, 2007, p. 3) Support Services for SNUGCommunity agencies such as Metis Child, family services, and Catholic social services became supports for SNUG in providing information on accessing social services (Nowlan, 2007) Alberta Alcohol and Drug abuse commission provided SNUG with detox and addiction opportunities.YMCA provided emergency shelters The city of Edmonton contributed food vouchers, bus passes, and other miscellaneous items(Nowlan, 2007)Project SNUG is an outreach program founded in 2005 to help serve and protect sex workers in Edmonton Alberta. SNUG runs 2 to 3 times a month and provides sex workers with multiple supports and services. Such include: food security; personal needs; tracking of each individuals safety; child welfare support; in-home family support; and lastly an identification process to help investigators in the case of a disappearance of a sex worker. SNUG also provides sex workers both a short and long term healing process. Sex workers who choose to access the long term process choose to participate in an intensive detox treatment. The ultimate vision of the program was to help create and maintain a safe place for these women. SNUG also offers a sweat lodge process upon participants request (Gov. of Canada, Department of Justice)What is the need for such Organizations?Sex Worker SafetySex workers live an extremely high risk life style. Every time they go out working the streets their life is threatened. The Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (1997) records 63 prostitutes being murdered between 1991 and 1995 in Alberta. "50 were killed by johns, 8 by pimps or drug related incidents and the remainder by husbands, common law spouses and boyfriends (Canadian centre for justice statistics, 1997 p.1)". Johns carry out a majority of the physical and sexual assaults on prostitutes. "Homicides of prostitutes remain unsolved at a much higher rate than homicides of individuals not involved in prostitution" (John howard society, 2001, p.4). The case of Robert PicktonCommunity DeteriorationNot only is the safety of sex workers an issue, the integrated community becomes 'at risk'. The communities surrounding the pursuit of prostitution are often congested with traffic, noisy, littered,  harassment of residents, deplete in property values and businesses (John howards society, 2001). Since prostitution is unsafe, the integrated communities are unsafe. These women had come to police on multiple occasions expressing that Pickton was murdering their fellow workers and friends. By the time police responded Pickton had committed multiple gruesome crimes. who are some of these organizations that work with sex workers?Servants Anonymous of CalgaryServants anonymous of Calgary is a not for profit organization that offers long term programs to help serve and support women who have been exploited or are at risk in the sex industry. This organization offers programs such as: Housing, childcare, employment training and a follow up program to help participants keep on track (Retrieved from http://www.servantsanon.com/) Project KARES.T.O.R.M (Sex Trade Out Reach Mobile)S.T.O.R.M. operates out of Ontario and serves women who work in the sex trade with multiple services. The organization provides emergency shelters and immediate medical and safety response. They offer a mobile service to help seek out sex workers on the streets. Sex workers are asked to help police identify "bad date lists". Police can then take action on individuals who abuse the sex workers. The program also offers sex workers to participate in an identification process in the possible case of going missing. The program strives to integrate multiple indigenous ways of knowing throughout their program. (Gov. of Canada, Department of Justice)Project KARE is a organization that investigates murdered or missing high risk individuals in the Edmonton area. Project KARE has expanded to all areas of Alberta and continues to protect high risk populations. Project KARE was the program illustrated in the documentary "Who Cares" and incorporates many of the services previously discussed: Outreach Program, missing persons identification process, and supply of basic needs i.e. medical, food, water, shelter, clothing etc. (Gov. of Canada, Department of Justice)What are the public attitudes towards prostitution?The public viewed prostitution in a very negative light. It was immoral and degrading. Sex workers were treated as less human due to their choices in how they survived. "Although prostitution often appears to be a career choice for those involved, it is essential to understand the overwhelming coercion and desperation behind that "choice" (John howards society ). A shift in attitudes...Past attitudes towards prostitutionKari Thomason (Right) a registered social worker and Jack Kraus (Left) a retired Edmonton police service detective are the brains behind Project SNUGProject SNUG is...Current legal action towards prostitution Recently, The Supreme Court of Canada removed three laws of prostitution prohibition ("Prostitution laws around," 2013) 1) Against keeping a brothel2) Living on the avails of prostitution3) Street solicitingThis was a huge achievement on behalf of sex workers. This achievement was largely accomplished through sex worker advocate Valerie Scott. Here is a link to a video that shows the accomplishments of such advocates: http://globalnews.ca/news/128029/at-a-glance-prostitution-laws/Unfortunately, there is speculation that parliament will re-write the laws that they believe will be beneficial for prostitution but in reality will do nothing. Sex workers are being excluded from the process of creating laws and therefore excluded from creating a brighter future for their profession (Stunt, 2014).We need to include the community in which we are working with!Here are some informative facts about prostitution to start off the presentationIn an experiment conducted by Farley and Barkan (1998) 57% of a 130 female adult sex workers experienced childhood sexual abuse The net incomes of female sex workers estimate between $12-$15,000 annually (McLaren, 1987) Sex workers often enter the industry between the ages of 14-16 years old (John Howard Society of Alberta, 2001)Between 20-25% of female street workers are married or have been, and some have children to care for (McLaren, 1987)Drug addictions are highly prevalent among the sex worker population (Boritch, 1997)"only a quarter of Canadians support a complete prohibition on prostitution with another 16 per cent supporting the status quo." ("A public opinion," 2010)Retired RCMP staff sergeant Don Adam "found it astounding that there were 52 unsolved prostitute murders and the solve rate was only 50% well below most homicides" (Hall, 2012)Full transcriptMore presentations by
