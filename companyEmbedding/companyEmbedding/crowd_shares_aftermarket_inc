(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995  This Annual Report, other than historical information, may include forward-looking statements, including statements with respect to financial results, product introductions, market demand, sales channels, industry trends, sufficiency of cash resources and certain other matters. These statements are made under the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1.A. and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Overview  The Company business model provides outsourced SCF services including due diligence and developing marketing programs for companies looking to utilize technology to reach a broader potential investor base.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014  Revenue  Revenue totaled $21,700 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0 in the prior year. The increase is due to the Company focusing on new SCF business.  Expenses  Operating expenses totaled $50,304 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $52,627 in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was related to website development expenses incurred in 2014. Current year operating expenses included selling, general and administrative expenses.  Interest Expense and Loss from Continuing Operations  Interest expense totaled $28,861 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $26,526 in 2014. The increase in interest expenses was related to the OID described above. Gain from discontinued operations totaled $29 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to loss of $903 in the prior year. The increase in gain from discontinued operations was related to the discontinued operations consisting of only four months in 2015 versus twelve months in 2014.  Net Income / Loss  Net losses totaled $57,436 for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to the selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense discussed above. Net losses totaled $80,057 for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred losses of $57,436 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and have a working capital deficit of $454,861 and an accumulated deficit of $486,250 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we had cash of $2.  We started to generate revenue in January 2011, however, in order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Accordingly, management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and other securities.  Our current funding is not sufficient to continue our operations for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. We will require additional debt and/or equity financing to continue our operations. We cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.  If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease or delay development of our operations, sell assets or our business may fail. In each such case, the holders of our common stock would lose all or most of their investment. Please see "Risk Factors" for information regarding the risks related to our financial condition.  Inflation Risk  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs such as gasoline were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.  Capital Resources and Requirements  Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:  ? the extent and duration of future operating income;  ? the level and timing of future sales and expenditures;  ? working capital required to support our growth;  ? investment capital for equipment;  ? our sales and marketing programs;  ? investment capital for potential acquisitions;  ? competition; and  ? market developments.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  Issuance of Shares for Non-Cash Consideration  The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ("ASU 2015-03"), which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.  In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ("ASU 2015-14"). The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period.  In September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) ("ASU 2015-16"). Topic 805 requires that an acquirer retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this Update either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, "Development Stage Entities". The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had` been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively. The early adoption of ASU 2014-10 is permitted which removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements from the Company.  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-10 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In November 2014, the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us" and "our" refer to Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation provide information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and all our other filings, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") through the date of this report.  Forward Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes both historical and forward-looking statements, which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulations. Words such as "may," "should," "could," "would," "predicts," "potential," "continue," "expects," "anticipates," "future," "intends," "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are intended to operate as "forward-looking statements" of the kind permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, incorporated in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). That legislation protects such predictive statements by creating a "safe harbor" from liability in the event that a particular prediction does not turn out as anticipated. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will probably not be accurate indications of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or our management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. You should review carefully the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain of the risks that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or suggested by the forward-looking statements.  The inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us, or any other person, that such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should be aware that any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of the foregoing, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Business Overview  The Company's business operations support securities crowdfunding ("SCF") activities. SCF in its simplest terms, is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities. Steven Case, the former AOL exec, often quips that "an average middle class person can go to Vegas and gamble away $10,000, but that same person can't invest $10,000 in Facebook before its public." The SCF movement seeks to change this paradigm.  Reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current $2B mark in 2012 to over $500B in just the US alone. In essence, this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technology-assisted SCF platforms. These platforms standardize the process, make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs, and, most importantly, broaden the investor target reach or visibility. The SCF movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance; but rather, a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved. As with the first wave of ecommerce, the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given product/offering. No longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes.  The Company believes (and data suggests) that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the UK today or the US with the JOBS Act changes. These changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries, will enable a truly global network of small business funding. Just like a US consumer can buy products from the UK via the internet, investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location.  The Company earns revenue by providing outsourced SCF services including developing marketing programs for companies looking to utilize technology to reach a broader potential investor base. The Company's business does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component.  The SCF industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market ("LMM") companies to financing and investor access to private placements.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2014  Revenue  Revenues totaled $14,200 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 versus $0 in the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was as a result of the Company's discontinued operations (Please refer to Note 8 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS).  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses totaled $11,860 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $14,418 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The current period expenses are primarily comprised of $8,439 of professional fees as well as other general and administrative expenses.  Other Expenses  Other expense totaled $7,967 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6,603 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Other expenses are comprised of interest expense.  Net Loss  Net loss totaled $5,400 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 due primarily to the professional fees. Net loss totaled $21,293 for the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2014  Revenue  Revenues totaled $14,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 versus $0 in the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in revenue was as a result of the Company's discontinued operations (Please refer to Note 8 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS).  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses totaled $29,976 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $36,648 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The current period expenses are primarily comprised $25,886 in professional fees, as well as other general and administrative expenses. Expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014 were primarily comprised of $24,840 of professional fees, as well as other general and administrative expenses.  Other Expenses  Other expense totaled $16,936 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $12,832 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The current period expenses are primarily comprised of $16,936 of interest expense.  Net Loss  Net loss totaled $32,683 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 due primarily to the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Net loss totaled $49,971 for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred losses of $32,683 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and have an accumulated deficit of $461,497 at June 30, 2015. At June 30, 2015, we had cash of $2.  We started to generate revenue in January 2011, however, in order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Accordingly, management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and other securities.  On June 14, 2013, the Company entered into Convertible Note Purchase Agreements with six accredited investors for the purchase and sale by the Company of $215,000 of its 10% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due December 31, 2014 ("Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes, issued on June 14, 2013, constitute the senior indebtedness of the Company. The Company and investors agreed that no indebtedness senior to the Convertible Notes may be created without the consent of holders of a majority in interest of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes and all accrued interest are convertible by the Convertible Note holders into shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $1.00 per share ("Conversion Price"). Shares acquired upon conversion will be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 six months after the date of issue of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are secured by a lien on all of the Company's assets. Interest on the Convertible Notes will accrue and be paid at maturity or converted into common stock when each respective Convertible Note is converted. The Convertible Notes shall be subject to mandatory conversion at the applicable Conversion Price upon the completion of a qualified financing, defined as an equity financing of not less than $1.5 million in aggregate gross proceeds from any equity or equity derivative financing. The Company agreed to include the shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes (unless eligible for resale under Rule 144) in any registration statement filed by the Company other than in connection with compensation plans and certain other types of transactions.  As of June 30, 2015, the Company had $215,000 in Convertible Notes outstanding.  On February 7, 2015, the Company issued and sold a $12,000 Note due May 7, 2015. The proceeds to the Company were $8,000 and the Company recorded an Original Issue Discount ("OID") of $4,000 which will be amortized over the life of the note. Interest expense totaled $4,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The unamortized OID balance at June 30, 2015 was $ 0.  Our current funding is sufficient to continue our operations for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, however, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing to continue our operation beyond December 31, 2015. We cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.  If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease or delay development of our operations, sell assets or our business may fail. In each such case, the holders of our common stock would lose all or most of their investment. Please see "Risk Factors" for information regarding the risks related to our financial condition.  Inflation Risk  We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs such as gasoline were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.  Capital Resources and Requirements  Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:  ? the extent and duration of future operating income;  ? the level and timing of future sales and expenditures;  ? working capital required to support our growth;  ? investment capital for transportation vehicles and equipment;  ? our sales and marketing programs;  ? investment capital for potential acquisitions;  ? competition; and  ? market developments.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360-10"). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. The Company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of December 31, 2014.  Issuance of Shares for Non-Cash Consideration  The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard which provides new guidance that requires share-based compensation to meet a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and that could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation costs should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this Update either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, "Development Stage Entities". The amendments in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had' been in the development stage. The amendments in this update are applied retrospectively. The early adoption of ASU 2014-10 is permitted which removed the development stage entity financial reporting requirements from the Company.  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting by reducing the cost and complexity associated with the incremental reporting requirements of development stage entities. The amendments in this update remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, thereby improving financial reporting by eliminating the cost and complexity associated with providing that information. The amendments in this Update also eliminate an exception provided to development stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity that is at risk. The amendments to eliminate that exception simplify U.S. GAAP by reducing avoidable complexity in existing accounting literature and improve the relevance of information provided to financial statement users by requiring the application of the same consolidation guidance by all reporting entities. The elimination of the exception may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the development stage. The amendments related to the elimination of inception-to-date information and the other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915 should be applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. For public companies, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-10 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the standard (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The standard in this Update is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In November 2014, the FASB issued new guidance for determining when separation of certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required. That is, an entity will continue to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. The amendments clarify how current GAAP should be interpreted in evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share. The effects of initially adopting the amendments in this Update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Retrospective application is permitted to all relevant prior periods. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance to provide an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. After the effective date, an acquired entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-control event. However, if the financial statements for the period in which the most recent change-in-control event occurred already have been issued or made available to be issued, the application of this guidance would be a change in accounting principle. The amendments in this Update are effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

	Organization






	 




	Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. (“the Company”) was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2007, under the name Red Oak Concepts, Inc. to serve as a vehicle for a business combination through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination.  On December 4, 2007, the Company changed its jurisdiction of domicile by merging with a Nevada corporation titled Red Oak Concepts, Inc.  On November 21, 2008, the Company changed its name to Vinyl Products, Inc. in connection with a reverse acquisition transaction with The Vinyl Fence Company, Inc. (“VFC”), a California corporation. On September 26, 2013, the Company formed Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On October 8, 2013, the Company merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. and as part of the merger changed its name to Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc.




	 




	On November 20, 2008, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with VFC.  Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of VFC from the VFC shareholders in exchange for 22,100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.  Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on November 21, 2008, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada to change its corporate name to “Vinyl Products, Inc.” to better reflect its business. On October 8, 2013, the Company merged with its wholly owned subsidiary, Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc. and as part of the merger changed its name to Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc.




	 






	Brackin O’Connor Transaction






	On December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the membership interests in Brackin O’Connor, LLC (“

	Brackin O’Connor

	”). Brackin O’Connor operates a passenger transportation business. Its initial operations are focused on servicing the tourism industry in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Company agreed to issue 20,000,000 shares of its common stock to the members of Brackin O’Connor in exchange for the membership interests in Brackin O’Connor (the “

	Equity Exchange

	”).









	VFC Disposition






	Following completion of the Equity Exchange, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to dispose of all of the capital stock of its subsidiaries,

	VFC

	and VFC Franchise Corp. to Gordon Knott, formerly the Company’s President and member of its Board of Directors, and Garabed Khatchoyan, formerly a member of its Board of Directors (the “

	VFC Disposition

	”). VFC conducts all of the Company’s vinyl product marketing and installation business.







	In exchange for the capital stock of VFC and VFC Franchise Corp., Messrs Knott and Khatchoyan agreed to return to the Company 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and to assume up to $75,000 of liabilities arising from periods prior to December 31, 2010.  In connection with the VFC Disposition, the Company agreed to reimburse certain expenses incurred by VFC through payment of $12,500 in cash and the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $62,500. The promissory note was paid in full in April 2011. See Note 4 for further discussion.




	 




	Brackin O’Connor, LLC was formed as an Arizona limited liability company in February, 2005 for the purpose of acquiring and operating a drinking lounge establishment in Scottsdale, Arizona.




	 




	On September 1, 2009, Brackin O’Connor entered into an agreement for sale of the drinking lounge. In 2010, Brackin O’Connor changed focus and entered the passenger transportation business commonly referred to as a chauffeured vehicle service. In accordance with ASC 915, Brackin O’Connor is considered to have re-entered into the development stage as Brackin O’Connor discontinued operations due to the sale of the drinking lounge.




	 




	On April 8, 2011, the Company

	entered into a Promissory note with Doug Brackin for a total of $62,500.

	The promissory note was not paid by the maturity date of July 31, 2011, and accordingly, the note started to accrue compounding interest at 1.25% per month effective August 1, 2011. Interest expense totaled $959 and $5,882 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively. The Company made a partial principal payment in the amount of $50,000 in July 2013. See Note 4 for further discussion.

	Business Overview of Brackin O’Connor






	 




	Since its establishment until September 2009, Brackin O’Connor has been principally engaged in the drinking lounge business. In 2010, Brackin O’Connor changed focus and entered the passenger transportation business commonly referred to as a chauffeured vehicle service. Its initial operations are focused on servicing the tourism industry in Scottsdale, Arizona under the brand name of “Ride The Dougie”. Brackin O’Connor provides chauffeured vehicle service for concert and weddings, airport shuttles, business and association meetings, conventions, road shows, promotional tours, special events, incentive travel and leisure travel and mobile concierge services.





	 







	Business Overview of Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc.








	 






	During the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the Company began the development of a new business unit to support securities crowdfunding (SCF) activities. As part of this new business unit the Company developed a SCF platform and the business operations for supporting the Company’s entrée into this new market. The Company’s SCF platform includes an exchange for the trading of crowdfunded securities (i.e. a second market for crowdfunded shares), a front end issuer and investor SCF portal (for facilitating SCF transactions), and a US based broker dealer (“BD”) centric deal management and compliance platform (for BD white labeling and syndication).



	 



	The SCF industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market (“LMM”) companies to financing and investor access to private placements.




	 




	The Company has developed the SCF platform for use by the following:




	 







	 






	⋅






	Issuers who have sold securities via crowdfunding platforms








	 






	⋅






	Investors who have purchased securities via crowdfunding platforms








	 






	⋅






	Licensed financial entities, such as other FINRA member registered broker dealers







	 




	SCF in its simplest terms, is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities. Steven Case, the former AOL exec, often quips that “an average middle class person can go to Vegas and gamble away $10,000, but that same person can’t invest $10,000 in Facebook before its public.” The SCF movement seeks to change this paradigm.







	Reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current $2B mark in 2012 to over $500B in just the US alone. In essence, this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technology-assisted SCF platforms. These platforms standardize the process, make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs, and, most importantly, broaden the investor target reach or visibility. The SCF movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance; but rather, a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved. As with the first wave of ecommerce, the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given product/offering. No longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes.







	The Company believes (and data suggests) that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the UK today or the US with the JOBS Act changes. These changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries, will enable a truly global network of small business funding. Just like a US consumer can buy products from the UK via the internet, investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location.




	 




	The business model utilizes a platform service or listing fee structure, and does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component. This may change as the regulatory environment evolves in the US, and globally, but for now a simple service-fee model has been established. The Company began generating revenue for its SCF business unit during the quarter ended September 30, 2013.

	NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES









	 










	Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation








	 






	The Company maintains its accounting records on an accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The financial statements include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary, Brackin O’Connor. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.






	 






	Because the acquisition of Brackin O’Connor was treated as a reverse acquisition, the financial statements of the Company have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the acquisition from the beginning of the reported periods. The Equity Exchange transaction has been accounted as a reverse merger and recapitalization of the Company whereby Brackin O’Connor is deemed to be the accounting acquirer (legal acquiree) and the Company to be the accounting acquiree (legal acquirer).  The basis of the assets, liabilities and retained earnings of Brackin O’Connor has been carried over in the recapitalization, and earnings per share have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse merger.






	 








	Going Concern










	 








	The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $110,629 during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and an accumulated deficit of $306,492 since inception. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.






	 






	In order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and or a debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.






	 






	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.






	 








	Use of Estimates








	 






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are adjusted to reflect actual experience when necessary. Significant estimates and assumptions affect many items in the financial statements. These include allowance for doubtful trade receivables, asset impairments, and contingencies and litigation. Significant estimates and assumptions are also used to establish the fair value and useful lives of depreciable tangible and certain intangible assets. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such results may affect income, financial position or cash flows.








	 










	Cash and Cash Equivalents








	 






	Cash and equivalents include investments with initial maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash balances at credit-worthy financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000. Deposits with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company did not have any cash equivalents at September 30, 2013 or December 31, 2012.








	 










	 


















	9

















	 










	Property, Plant and Equipment








	 






	Equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The Company reviews the carrying value of long-term assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred. Major overhaul that extends the useful life of existing assets is capitalized. When equipment is retired or disposed, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated and the resulting profit or loss is recognized in income.








	 










	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets








	 






	The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360-10"). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. The Company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of December 31, 2012.








	 










	Revenue Recognition








	 






	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s current revenue stream consists of chauffeured vehicle services. Such revenue is recognized when the services are performed.







	 





	Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable, collection of the fees is probable, delivery of the service and or product has occurred, and no other significant obligations on the part of the Company remain.






	 






	Revenue received from transportation customers consists of payments via credit cards, checks and cash and is deposited into the Company’s bank account when received, either directly or through the Company’s merchant account.






	 








	Stock Based Compensation








	 






	The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements using the fair value method in accordance with the accounting provisions relating to share-based payments (“Codification Topic 718”).  The company accounts for the stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with these provisions. Stock options are valued using a Black-Scholes options pricing model which requires estimates such as expected term, discount rate and stock volatility.






	 








	Issuance of Shares for Non-Cash Consideration

















	 





	The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB

	.

	The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.







	 







	Income Taxes










	 








	The Company accounts for income taxes under standards issued by the FASB. Under those standards, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax benefits or consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not, that such assets will not be realized through future operations.






	 






	 












	10















	 






	No provision for federal income taxes has been recorded due to the net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $261,000 as of September 30, 2013 that will be offset against future taxable income.  The available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $261,000 will expire in various years through 2033.  No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements because the Company believes there is a 50% or greater chance the carry forwards will expire unused.







	 







	Fair value of financial instruments








	 






	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates fair value since their terms are similar to those in the lending market for comparable loans with risks. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes. The Company utilizes various types of financing to fund its business needs, including convertible debt. The Company reviews its conversion features of securities issued as to whether they are freestanding or contain an embedded derivative and, if so, whether they are classified as a liability at each reporting period until the amount is settled and reclassified into equity with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings.







	 







	Recent Accounting Pronouncements









	 





	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02,

	Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

	, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The amendments in the ASU do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. All of the information that this ASU requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The new amendments will require an organization to:






	 








	 







	-








	Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period; and









	 






	 






	 








	 







	-








	Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense.









	 






	The amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income. Public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods (interim and annual). The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2013-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.






	 






	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01,

	Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

	, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements originally established by ASU 2011-11. The new ASU addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under ASU 2011-11 was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to financial statement users. In choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures, the Board determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those prepared under IFRSs. Like ASU 2011-11, the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2013-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.





	 




	 











	11














	 





	In October 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2012-04, “Technical Corrections and Improvements” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-04. The amendments in this update cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification. These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements. The amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.






	 






	In August 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-03, “Technical Amendments and Corrections to SEC Sections: Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 114, Technical Amendments Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-9250, and Corrections Related to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-22 (SEC Update)” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-03. This update amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SAB No. 114. The adoption of ASU 2012-03 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.






	 






	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, “Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02. This update amends ASU 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment and permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - General Intangibles Other than Goodwill. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.






	 






	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement of income where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-12 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.






	 






	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 “Balance Sheet: Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities” (“ASU 2011-11”). This Update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of IFRS. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

	Depreciation expense totaled $3,492 and $3,492 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s parent Company has issued a promissory note and this promissory note is secured by a vehicle owned by Brackin O’Connor.












	NOTE 4NOTES PAYABLE





	 




	On December 31, 2010, in connection with the VFC Disposition, the Company agreed to reimburse certain expenses incurred by VFC through the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $62,500. The promissory note was paid in full in April 2011.



	 



	On April 8, 2011, the Company

	entered into a Promissory note with Doug Brackin for a total of $62,500.

	The promissory note was not paid by the maturity date of July 31, 2011, and accordingly, the note started to accrue compounding interest at 1.25% per month effective August 1, 2011. Interest expense totaled $5,882 and $7,385 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company made a partial principal payment in the amount of $50,000 in July 2013. No interest was paid by the Company to Doug Brackin during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The balance of the note as of September 30, 2013 was $12,500.





	 





	On June 14, 2013, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements with six accredited investors for the purchase and sale by the Company of $215,000 of its 10% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due December 31, 2014 (“Convertible

	Notes

	”). The Convertible Notes, issued on June 14, 2013, constitute the senior indebtedness of the Company. The Company and investors agreed that no indebtedness senior to the Convertible Notes may be created without the consent of holders of a majority in interest of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes and all accrued interest are convertible by the Convertible Note holders into shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $1.00 per share (“

	Conversion Price

	”). Shares acquired upon conversion will be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 six months after the date of issue of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are secured by a lien on all of the Company’s assets.

	Item 2.








	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.








	 




	In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context requires otherwise, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to

	Crowd Shares Aftermarket, Inc.

	, a Nevada corporation. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation provide information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and all our other filings, including Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) through the date of this report.




	 





	Forward Looking Statements





	 




	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes both historical and forward-looking statements, which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulations. Words such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are intended to operate as “forward-looking statements” of the kind permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, incorporated in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). That legislation protects such predictive statements by creating a “safe harbor” from liability in the event that a particular prediction does not turn out as anticipated. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will probably not be accurate indications of when such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or our management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. You should review carefully the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 4 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain of the risks that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or suggested by the forward-looking statements.









	 



	The inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us, or any other person, that such forward-looking statements will be achieved. You should be aware that any forward-looking statement made by us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of the foregoing, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.





	 




	Overview

The Company provides chauffeured vehicle service for concert and weddings, airport shuttles, business and association meetings, conventions, road shows, promotional tours, special events, incentive travel and leisure travel and mobile concierge services.




	 





	Recent Developments Affecting the Company






	 







	Securities Crowdfunding








	 






	During the quarter ended September 30, 2013, the Company began the development of a new business unit to support securities crowdfunding (SCF) activities. As part of this new business unit the Company developed a SCF platform and the business operations for supporting the Company’s entrée into this new market. The Company’s SCF platform includes an exchange for the trading of crowdfunded securities (i.e. a second market for crowdfunded shares), a front end issuer and investor SCF portal (for facilitating SCF transactions), and a US based broker dealer (“BD”) centric deal management and compliance platform (for BD white labeling and syndication).









	 



	 







	17















	 



	The SCF industry is growing at a rapid pace and with regulatory changes promises to significantly enhance the access by lower middle market (“LMM”) companies to financing and investor access to private placements.














	 




	The Company has developed the SCF platform for use by the following:




	 









	·






	Issuers who have sold securities via crowdfunding platforms










	·






	Investors who have purchased securities via crowdfunding platforms










	·






	Licensed financial entities, such as other FINRA member registered broker dealers







	 




	SCF in its simplest terms, is a global movement towards broadening the investor base in small businesses by lowering accreditation standards of investors and changing the rules around the marketing of investment opportunities. Steven Case, the former AOL exec, often quips that “an average middle class person can go to Vegas and gamble away $10,000, but that same person can’t invest $10,000 in Facebook before its public.” The SCF movement seeks to change this paradigm.









	 



	Reports have been published that suggest fund raising through crowdfunding mechanisms will grow from the current $2B mark in 2012 to over $500B in just the US alone. In essence, this suggests that the fundamental mechanism or process through which angel and seed funding will occur will be through technology-assisted SCF platforms. These platforms standardize the process, make it more transparent for both investors and entrepreneurs, and, most importantly, broaden the investor target reach or visibility. The SCF movement is less about blazing a new trail in new unchartered waters of finance; but rather, a shift towards utilizing technology platforms to make the existing process available to a wider audience less friction for all those involved. As with the first wave of ecommerce, the primary innovation will be simply expanding the potential audience for a given product/offering. No longer will deal access be singularly controlled by the few with deep rolodexes.









	 



	The Company believes (and data suggests) that most modern governments will push regulation towards a structure mirroring an environment like that seen in the UK today or the US with the JOBS Act changes. These changes coupled with technology platforms that span geographic boundaries, will enable a truly global network of small business funding. Just like a US consumer can buy products from the UK via the internet, investors will be able to see and access deals regardless of their geographic location.




	 




	The business model utilizes a platform service or listing fee structure, and does not contemplate a transaction or success fee component. This may change as the regulatory environment evolves in the US, and globally, but for now a simple service-fee model has been established. The Company began generating revenue for its SCF business unit during the quarter ended September 30, 2013.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources











	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we incurred losses of $110,629 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and have an accumulated deficit of $306,492 at September 30, 2013. At September 30, 2013, we had cash of $44,649.









	 



	We started to generate revenue in January 2011, however, in order to continue as a going concern, develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations, we will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Accordingly, management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through sales of common stock and other securities.









	 



	On June 14, 2013, the Company entered into Convertible Note Purchase Agreements with six accredited investors for the purchase and sale by the Company of $215,000 of its 10% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due December 31, 2014 (“Convertible

	Notes

	”). The Convertible Notes, issued on June 14, 2013, constitute the senior indebtedness of the Company. The Company and investors agreed that no indebtedness senior to the Convertible Notes may be created without the consent of holders of a majority in interest of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes and all accrued interest are convertible by the Convertible Note holders into shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $1.00 per share (“

	Conversion Price

	”). Shares acquired upon conversion will be eligible for sale pursuant to Rule 144 six months after the date of issue of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are secured by a lien on all of the Company’s assets. Interest on the Convertible Notes will accrue and be paid at maturity or converted into common stock when each respective Convertible Note is converted. The Convertible Notes shall be subject to mandatory conversion at the applicable Conversion Price upon the completion of a qualified financing, defined as an equity financing of not less than $1.5 million in aggregate gross proceeds from any equity or equity derivative financing. The Company agreed to include the shares of Common Stock underlying the Convertible Notes (unless eligible for resale under Rule 144) in any registration statement filed by the Company other than in connection with compensation plans and certain other types of transactions.




	 




	As of September 30, 2013, the Company had $215,000 in Convertible Notes outstanding.









	 



	Our current funding is sufficient to continue our operations for the remainder of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, however, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing to continue our operation beyond December 31, 2013. We cannot provide any assurances that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, may not be available on acceptable terms.









	 



	If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease or delay development of our operations, sell assets or our business may fail. In each such case, the holders of our common stock would lose all or most of their investment. Please see “Risk Factors” for information regarding the risks related to our financial condition.





	 






	Inflation Risk












	 



	We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, if our costs such as gasoline were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.









	 



	 







	20



















	 








	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements










	 



	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.





	 






	Capital Resources and Requirements












	 



	Our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors, including:









	 








	·






	the extent and duration of future operating income;










	·






	the level and timing of future sales and expenditures;










	·






	working capital required to support our growth;










	·






	investment capital for transportation vehicles and equipment;










	·






	our sales and marketing programs;

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 




	We prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.




	 




	The following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.




	 






	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets








	 




	The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment ("ASC 360-10"). ASC 360-10 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the Company be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually or more often if events and circumstances warrant. Events relating to recoverability may include significant unfavorable changes in business conditions, recurring losses or a forecasted inability to achieve break-even operating results over an extended period. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based upon forecasted undiscounted cash flows. Should impairment in value be indicated, the carrying value of intangible assets will be adjusted, based on estimates of future discounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. ASC 360-10 also requires assets to be disposed of be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. The Company performed an annual review for impairment and none existed as of December 31, 2012.




	 






	Issuance of Shares for Non-Cash Consideration













	 



	The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and/or services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably determinable. The Company's accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services follows the provisions of standards issued by the FASB

	.

	The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor's performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement.

	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements






	 




	In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02,

	Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

	, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The amendments in the ASU do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. All of the information that this ASU requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The new amendments will require an organization to:




	 









	-






	Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period; and







	 









	-






	Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense.







	 




	The amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income. Public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods (interim and annual). The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, for public companies. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2013-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.




	 




	In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01,

	Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

	, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements originally established by ASU 2011-11. The new ASU addresses preparer concerns that the scope of the disclosure requirements under ASU 2011-11 was overly broad and imposed unintended costs that were not commensurate with estimated benefits to financial statement users. In choosing to narrow the scope of the offsetting disclosures, the Board determined that it could make them more operable and cost effective for preparers while still giving financial statement users sufficient information to analyze the most significant presentation differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those prepared under IFRSs. Like ASU 2011-11, the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2013-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.




	 




	In October 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2012-04, “Technical Corrections and Improvements” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-04. The amendments in this update cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification. These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements. The amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.




	 




	In August 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-03, “Technical Amendments and Corrections to SEC Sections: Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 114, Technical Amendments Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-9250, and Corrections Related to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-22 (SEC Update)” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-03. This update amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SAB No. 114. The adoption of ASU 2012-03 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.




	 






	 







	22














	 






	 




	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, “Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02. This update amends ASU 2011-08, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment and permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - General Intangibles Other than Goodwill. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.




	 




	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement of income where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-12 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition.




	 




	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 “Balance Sheet: Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities” (“ASU 2011-11”). This Update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of IFRS. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-11 did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial condition..




	 








	Item 3.








	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.









	 





	We are a smaller reporting company and therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this item of Form 10-Q.




	 








	Item 4.








	Controls and Procedures.









	 






	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	 




	Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2013. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2013, and this assessment identified certain material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, including material weaknesses due to our management’s lack of segregation of duties in financial transactions or reporting as a result of the fact that we only have two officers. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.





	 





	 







	23














	 


	 




	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2013.




	 





	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	 




	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.








	 




	On March 1, 2011, we entered into three separate consulting agreements. We agreed to issue a total of 2,500,000 shares of restricted common stock as payment for services provided under the respective consulting agreements. All of the above shares were issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with this issuance, all purchasers were provided with access to all material aspects of the company, including the business, management, offering details, risk factors and financial statements. They also represented to us that they were acquiring the shares as a principal for their own account with investment intent. They each also represented that they were sophisticated, having prior investment experience and having adequate and reasonable opportunity and access to any corporate information necessary to make an informed decision. This issuance of securities was not accompanied by general advertisement or general solicitation.



	 


	 



	On June 14, 2013, the Company issued and sold $215,000 of its 10% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes due December 31, 2014. These securities were offered to accredited investors in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “

	Securities Act

	”) under Regulation D. The securities in the offering have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state “blue sky” securities laws, and may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
