In general, once you have identified and collected the dead person's belongings, including their money, property, and other assets, you pay the person's debts and taxes. Once all debts have been paid, you distribute their money and property according to the language of the will. If there is no will, the laws of the state where the dead person lived control how the property is distributed. A probate attorney helps you plan what happens to your property when you die, as they can probate wills and act as your probate court estate representative. A probate attorney also represents family members and beneficiaries wishing to challenge wills.Probate lawyers in cities near East Brunswick, NJBrickBrooklynEdisonElizabethJersey CityNew BrunswickNewarkPlainfieldStaten IslandTinton FallsTrentonWall TownshipSee all cities in New Jersey East Brunswick, NJ attorneys in related practice areasEstate Planning Attorneys East Brunswick, NJTrusts Attorneys East Brunswick, NJWills and Living Wills Lawyers East Brunswick, NJLawsuit / Dispute Attorneys East Brunswick, NJSee all practice areas East Brunswick, NJ attorneys by top languagesSpanishSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave
