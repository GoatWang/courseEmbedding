Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Variable investment options are available only as investment options in variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not made available to the general public directly.
The Allianz Investment Management LLC, Allianz Global Investors, NFJ Investment Group LLC, RCM Capital Management LLC, and PIMCO investment options are managed by an affiliate of Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York and Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC. All are affiliated companies.
FIDELITY, FIDELITY INVESTMENTS and Pyramid logo, and VIP FundsManager, Pyramis and the Pyramis Global Advisors logo are registered service marks of FMR LLC. Used with permission.
For more complete information about variable annuities and variable investment options, call your financial professional or Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 800.624.0197 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other information about the variable annuity and variable investment options, which you should carefully consider. Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

The performance for Series II shares will be lower than Series I shares due to the higher Series II 12b-1 fee.
