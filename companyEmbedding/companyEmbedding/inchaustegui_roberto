Cornell University - Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management

                  Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management is the graduate business school of Cornell University, a private Ivy League university located in Ithaca, New York. It was founded in 1946 and renamed in 1984 after Samuel Curtis Johnson, founder of S.C.

The school is housed in Sage Hall and supports 59 full-time faculty members. There are about 600 Master of Business Administration (MBA) students in the full-time two-year and Accelerated MBA programs and 375 Executive MBA students.
