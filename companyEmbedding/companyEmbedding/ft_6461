        Beautiful rug very soft
This rug is good size for a bedroom or medium sized t.v. room. The red is bright and the rug is soft enough to sleep on.

Front Load Washers

Front load washing machines are becoming increasingly popular due largely to their high performance & value. Front load washers save both water and electricity while reducing the wear your clothing endures in traditional washing machines. Front loading washers & dryers may also offer more aesthetic value for your laundry area as they are available in a variety of color options, including Red, Blue and Grey among others.

Description
The front-loading W6461 features easy-to-use dial controls with push buttons to choose options. As you choose the program, an LED window displays the settings for that program. Simply press the temperature or spin speed button to change the settings. Once the program starts, the LED window shows the time remaining. 

Like all ASKO washers, the W6461 features superior washing and rinsing, stainless steel inner and outer tanks, internal water heater (from 85° to 205° F), Quattro no-walk suspension, and top-loader-like capacity. This model has adjustable spin speeds from 400 to 1,600 rpm. 

The W6461 also has ASKO's exclusive wrinkle-free program: The drum rotates periodically for up to two hours after the wash program is finished to help keep wrinkles from setting in. The W6461 has 11 wash programs to meet all your laundry needs, including Quick Wash. This program completes a load in 35 minutes but still has three rinses to remove soil and detergent - most washers rinse only once. Quick Wash also has a long spin cycle to shorten drying times by removing more water from the clothes.
