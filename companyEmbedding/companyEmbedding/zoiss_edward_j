Edward J. (Ed) Zoiss is president of Harris Corporation’s Electronic Systems segment. In this role, he is responsible for business strategy, financial performance, successful execution and growth for Electronic Systems, which covers an extensive portfolio of solutions in electronic warfare, avionics (including carriage and release systems), wireless solutions, C4I systems and mission networks.
Previously, Zoiss was vice president and general manager of the Defense business unit within Harris Government Communications Systems. This business served U.S. and international customers with critical military interoperable communication products, as well as Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) solutions for protecting national security and aiding public safety agencies. Prior to that role, he served as vice president of C4ISR Electronics, which provided specialized solutions to defense, intelligence, and public safety agencies.
Before assuming responsibility for the C4ISR business, Zoiss was vice president of Advanced Programs and Technology, where he led the division strategy, business development, marketing, and all internal research and development.
Joining Harris in 1995 as a principal mechanical engineer, Zoiss assumed positions of increasing responsibility, including director of Research and Development and vice president of Business Development for National Programs. He is the recipient of 13 patents.
Zoiss received his undergraduate degree from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, and his master’s in mechanical engineering from California State University at Northridge. In addition, he received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant.
He is a member of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Project Management Institute (PMI). He is also a member of the Georgia Institute of Technology Advisory Board on Engineering.
Harris Corporation is a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. Harris supports government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries and has approximately $6 billion in annual revenue. The company is organized into three business segments: Communication Systems, Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems.

David J. Barton 
August 31, 2012
Profile



Edward J. (Ed) Zoiss is vice president of Advanced Programs and Technology for the Government Communications Systems Division of Harris Corp.
Mr. Zoiss directly supports the operational business areas and is responsible for business development, new business training, and marketing, as well as internal research and development.
AP&T’s prime focus is customer and market expansion, capability development, emerging business opportunity incubation, and cross-business solution creation.
He supports all GCSD customers—including the intelligence community, DoD, and civil agencies of the U.S. government. Previously, Mr. Zoiss was the vice president of Business Development for GCSD’s National Programs and was responsible for new business strategies and new business resources that supported U.S. intelligence community customers. Before that, he was the director of GCSD’s Engineering Research and Development (R&D) program where he led the division portfolio of independent R&D encompassing all core technologies and business capabilities. In this role, he was also the chairman of the patent committee, and developed a corporate-wide intellectual property asset, through the creation of innovative solutions that encompassed a breadth of technologies.
Prior to his assignment with GCSD, Mr. Zoiss spent 10 years in a commercial division of Harris focused on the telecom industry. During this time, he held multiple assignments, eventually responsible for the entire division’s engineering team. He led the successful product release of many of the division’s core products, and has received thirteen patents for innovations developed for the telecom industry.
Zoiss received his undergraduate degree from the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, and his master’s in mechanical engineering from California State University at Northridge. In addition, he received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant. He is a member of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the Project Management Institute.
