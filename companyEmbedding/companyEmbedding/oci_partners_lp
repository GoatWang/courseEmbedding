Products and Services





HOME > Products and ServicesOCI Beaumont is committed to producing high quality products and is the partner of choice for North America's leading ammonia and methanol consumers.
Products
Methanol — A liquid petrochemical that is predominantly produced from natural gas and is utilized in a variety of industrial and energy-related applications.
Ammonia — When produced in anhydrous form (containing no water) from the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, ammonia constitutes the base feedstock for nearly all of the world's nitrogen chemical production.
Services
Our advantageous access and connectivity to our existing and prospective customers and feedstock suppliers allows OCI Beaumont to provide excellent logistical services.
Location — Strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast, our facility is connected to established infrastructure and transportation facilities. This includes pipeline connections to adjacent customers, port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia import and export jetties, and rail and trucking options. Access to these key facilities provides flexibility in delivery that is tailored to meet our customers' needs.
Facility — We are committed to operating efficiently and reliably. We completed a 13-month modernization of our methanol and ammonia production lines in 2012 to ensure consistent and timely delivery of our products to our customers.Learn more:MethanolAmmoniaFacility OverviewDistribution and LogisticsGeneral Conditions of Sale

OCI Partners LP

The Partnership is headquartered in Nederland, Texas. OCI Partners LP is listed on the NYSE in New York under the symbol “OCIP” and we own 80%.
World-Class Production Complex
Since acquiring OCI Beaumont in 2011, we have fully rehabilitated the facility and debottlenecked both lines, achieving a 25% increase in ammonia and methanol production capacity. Our investments in the facility have also resulted in reduced energy consumption, and greener ammonia and methanol production through the implementation of state-of-the-art Best Available Control Technology (BACT), a pollution control standard mandated by the United States Clean Air Act.
The integrated methanol-ammonia facility uses Lurgi GmbH’s Low Pressure Methanol technology and Haldor Topsøe technology. It is one of the world’s largest merchant methanol producers.
Strategic Location on Gulf Coast
OCI Beaumont is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast, which provides advantageous access and connectivity to established infrastructure and transportation facilities,
including pipeline connections to adjacent customers and port access with dedicated methanol and ammonia export barge docks. OCI Beaumont has connections to one major interstate and three major intrastate natural gas pipelines that provide access to significantly more natural gas supply than the facility requires and flexibility in sourcing natural gas feedstock. OCI Beaumont also has a state-of-theart ammonia and methanol truck loading facility on-site, providing flexibility to reach customers effectively. The facility also includes two ammonia tanks with a total capacity of 33 thousand metric tons and two methanol storage tanks with a total capacity of 42 thousand metric tons.
