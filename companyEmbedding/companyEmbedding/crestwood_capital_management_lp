continuously by Plaintiff, the Funds and/or Plaintiff’s predecessor firm in connection with
providingfinancial services, includingequitycapital investment services, investment management
services, and hedge fund investment services. In addition, since 2009, these trademarks have been
used continuously by Plaintiff, which serves as the investment manager and/or investment adviser

(collectively referred to as “Plaintiff’s marks”), which were filed between November 2009 and
April 2010.

party use of the term “Crestwood” as a trademark in the United States in the financial services
field.
4.Defendant Crestwood Capital Services, Inc. (“Defendant”) is currently using the
trademarks “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood Capital” and “Crestwood” in connection
with a variety of loan products and financial services in the United States, more particularly in the
New York area.
5.Defendant has elected to follow Plaintiff on LinkedIn, thereby intentionally
creating a link between Plaintiff and Defendant, causing LinkedIn to identify Plaintiff and
Defendant as similar companies and creating the appearance of an association between Plaintiff
and Defendant.
6.Defendant’s use of the trademarks “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood
Capital” and “Crestwood” in the financial services field has caused actual confusion, and is likely
to cause additional confusion in the future, with Plaintiff’s registered trademarks, which would
damage Plaintiff’s reputation and the goodwill that Plaintiff has established in its trademarks and
name.
7.In the last several weeks, Plaintiff has become aware of multiple instances of actual
confusion where persons contacted Plaintiff in the mistaken belief that Plaintiff and Defendant
were related companies or the same company based upon the similarity of their names.

cease using Plaintiff’s marks or to cease following Plaintiff on LinkedIn.

Facts
Plaintiff and its Registered Trademarks and Name
16.Crestwood Capital International, Ltd. and Crestwood Capital Partners, L.P. were
launched in 1995, and Crestwood Capital Partners II, L.P. was launched in 1998.
17.The above-referenced names have been used continuously since their respective
launch dates, although each entity was previously managed by a different investment
manager/adviser.
18.Plaintiff was formed in 2009 and serves as investment manager and/ adviser to each
of the Funds.
19.In its capacity as investment manager and/or adviser to the Funds, Plaintiff offers
services in the financial services field, including equity capital investment services, investment
management services, and hedge fund investment services, commonly referred to in the financial
services industry as the “alternatives” business.
20.Investors in the Funds managed by Plaintiff (referred to as “clients”) are generally
high net worth individuals, pension and profit sharing plans, charitable organizations, foundations,
corporations, partnerships, LLCs or other businesses and trusts.
21.Over the years, Plaintiff has developed a strong reputation in the financial services
field.
22.The Funds have, since their inception, consistently used the trademarks
“Crestwood” and other related marks that include the name “Crestwood Capital,” and since its
formation in 2009, Plaintiff, in connection with its services, has consistently used the trademarksCase 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 4 of 11
5
“Crestwood,” and related marks that include the name “Crestwood Capital”(collectively, defined
above as “Plaintiff’s marks”).
23.Plaintiff owns several registrations for its trademarks in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, namely, U.S. Registration Nos. 3,855,905, 3,988,260, 3,988,261, 3,988,262
and 3,988,263. Copies of Plaintiff’s trademark registrations for Plaintiff’s marks are attached to
this complaint as Exhibit A.
24.By virtue of the Funds’ and Plaintiff’s long use and Plaintiff’s registration of
Plaintiff’s marks in connection with its successful business, Plaintiff’s marks have become well-
known in the financial services community and are among Plaintiff’s most valuable assets.
25.By virtue of the Funds’ and Plaintiff’s long and exclusive use of its trademarks and
the goodwill that Plaintiff has established in its trademarks and name, Plaintiff’s marks are strong
trademarks entitled to a wide scope of protection.
Defendant’s Infringing Activities
26.In July2015, twenty years after the Funds began using the marks and six years after
Plaintiff’s first use in commerce of Plaintiff’s marks in the United States, Defendant began using
the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood,” and “Crestwood Capital” marks in the financial
services field.
27.Defendant has not attempted to register the “Crestwood Capital Services,”
“Crestwood” or “Crestwood Capital” marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
28.Defendant promotes the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood,” and
“Crestwood Capital” marks on the internet. True and correct copies of Defendant’s website,
located athttp://crestwoodcapitalinc.com/, and Defendant’sFacebook, and LinkedIn pages,, are
attached as Exhibit B.Case 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 5 of 11
6
29.In addition to certain of Plaintiff’s marks being identical to those used by
Defendant, Defendant, like Plaintiff, provides services in the financial services industry.
30.Specifically, Defendant markets itself as providing “alternative” financing to
investors, creating further confusion with Plaintiff’s provision of investment advisory services in
the “alternative investment” space.
31.Plaintiff has experienced instances of actual confusion between Plaintiff’s marks
and the marks being used by Defendant.
32.On multiple occasions, Plaintiff has been contacted erroneously by third parties
seeking to reach Defendant.
33.By way of example, Plaintiff received a phone call from an individual who
appeared to be a borrower, seeking to repay a loan from, or arranged, by Defendant.
34.Plaintiff also received an email from a company seeking to form a partnership
with Plaintiff to provide working capital to business owners. Plaintiff is not in the business of
providing financing, but Defendant is in that business, leading to the logical conclusion that
clients and other third parties are confused by Defendant’s use of Plaintiff’s registered
trademarks.
35.In an attempt to resolve Defendant’s infringement without court intervention,
Plaintiff has sent three letters to Defendant and its counsel. Defendant’s counsel has responded
to only the first letter. True and correct copies of all correspondence exchanged by the parties
to date are attached as Exhibit C.
Count I
Trademark Infringement Under 15 U.S.C. § 1114
36.Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations contained in the preceding
paragraphs in this Complaint as though the same were fully rewritten herein.Case 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 6 of 11

37.Section 1114(1)(a) of Title 15 of the United States Code states, in pertinent part:
Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant -- (a) use in commerce
any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of a registered mark in
connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods
or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or
to cause mistake, or to deceive…shall be liable in a civil action…
38.Plaintiff has not consented directly or indirectly to Defendant’s use of a trademark
using the name “Crestwood” in the financial services industry in anymanner and has expressed its
strong written objection to Defendant’s unauthorized use of Plaintiff’s marks.
39.Plaintiff does not currently have the ability to control the nature and/or quality of
the products/services sold or proposed to be sold by Defendant under the “Crestwood,”
“Crestwood Capital,” or “Crestwood Capital Services” trademarks.
40.As statedsupra, the Funds and Plaintiff have continuously used Plaintiff’s marks,
each of which has contained the name “Crestwood” and/or “Crestwood Capital” for many years,
and secured registrations for its marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.SeeExhibit A.
41.Plaintiff’s marks are inherently distinctive by virtue of the uncommon name,
“Crestwood.” Moreover, Plaintiff’s trademark registrations providePlaintiffwith thepresumption
that the marks are distinctive.
42.Byvirtueofthesuccess oftheservices providedunderPlaintiff’smarks, in addition
to Plaintiff’s efforts to promote its business, Plaintiff’s marks have come to have significance in
the financial services industry as an indicator of services associated with Plaintiff.
43.Defendant has improperly chosen the name “Crestwood” in forming its financial
services company and used the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood” and “Crestwood
Capital” marks in commerce to promote its services.SeeExhibit B.
44.Defendant’s use of the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood” andCase 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 7 of 11
8
“Crestwood Capital” marks is confusingly similar to Plaintiff’s registered “Crestwood” marks, as
“Crestwood” and/or “Crestwood Capital” are the only word in the marks that distinguish the
organizations from other financial services organizations.
45.The services provided by Plaintiff and Defendant are related, as are the trade
channels and clients of the two organizations.
46.As applied to the respective services offered, Plaintiff’s marks and the use by
Defendant of the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood” and “Crestwood Capital” marks are
so similar that Defendant’s use of these marks has caused, and is likely to further cause, confusion
and mistakes among customers and potential customers and those otherwise involved in the
financial services industry as to the source or sponsorship of Defendant’s services or the affiliation
between the organizations, causing harm to Plaintiff’s reputation and goodwill.
47.Defendant’s conduct constitutes trademark infringement in violation of 15 U.S.C.
§ 1114.
48.Defendant’s conduct is being conducted with willful disregard of Plaintiff’s
valuable trademark rights in Plaintiff’s marks. Defendant’s use of the “Crestwood Capital
Services,” “Crestwood” and “Crestwood Capital” marks, and its intentional following of Plaintiff
on LinkedIn (thereby creating a link between the two entities), constitute a willful attempt to trade
upon the goodwill that Plaintiff has developed in its marks through its many years of use of
Plaintiff’s marks.
49.Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law. The said conduct of Defendant, if not
enjoined, will cause irreparable damage to the rights of Plaintiff in its marks and its business,
reputation, and goodwill. Plaintiff’s damages from the aforesaid unlawful actions of Defendant
are not yet determined.Case 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 8 of 11

Count II
Unfair Competition Under 15 U.S.C. §1125(a)
50.Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations contained in the preceding
paragraphs of this complaint as though the same were fully rewritten herein.
51.Section 1125(a) of Title 15 of the United States Code states, in pertinent part:
Any person who, on or in connection with any good or services, … uses in

which -- is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive…as to the
origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial
activities by another person…shall be liable in a civil action.
52.Defendant’s use of the “Crestwood Capital Services,” “Crestwood” and
“Crestwood Capital” marks falsely suggests and/or will falsely suggest that Plaintiff is the source
of,orhas authorized, Defendant’suseofthemarks containingthe“Crestwood”and/or“Crestwood
Capital” name with Defendant’s services and is likely to deceive customers, prospective
customers, and members of the financial services industry and public into believing that
Defendant’s services are affiliated with Plaintiff, or that such services are authorized or approved
by Plaintiff, or are provided in affiliation with Plaintiff, in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).
53.Defendant’s conduct constitutes trademark infringement, unfair competition and
false designation of origin in violation of 15 U.S.C. §1125(a).
54.Defendant’s conduct is being conducted with willful disregard of Plaintiff’s
valuabletrademark rights in Plaintiff’s marks. Defendant’s use andplanned useofthe “Crestwood
Capital Services,” “Crestwood” and “Crestwood Capital” marks in connection with its services is
a willful attempt to trade upon the goodwill that Plaintiff has developed in its marks using the
“Crestwood” name through its many years of use of its marks.
55.Plaintiff has no adequate remedyat law. The said conduct of Defendant will cause,
ifnotenjoined,irreparabledamagetotherightsofPlaintiffinitsmarksanditsbusiness,reputation,Case 1:17-cv-02996-PGG Document 1 Filed 04/25/17 Page 9 of 11

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
