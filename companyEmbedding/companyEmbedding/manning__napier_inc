History











Client Focused for More Than 45 Years For more than four decades, Manning & Napier has been guiding individual and institutional clients toward their financial goals. Our independent, opportunistic style can help you meet a wide variety of investment needs even in the most challenging environments. We’re majority employee-owned, which means we’re able to give you the kind of service and commitment that only comes from people who have a direct stake in your success. Manning & Napier was founded in April of 1970 by Bill Manning and Bill Napier. To survive and grow in a difficult economic time, we had to add real value for our clients. As of  we manage  billion in assets for individuals, corporate benefit plans, union pension and annuity funds, endowments, foundations, profit sharing plans, and 401(k) plans. Headquartered just outside of Rochester, NY, we have additional offices in Columbus, OH, and St. Petersburg, FL to service clients nationwide. 














The Manning Rule











The Manning Rule
Our cofounder, Bill Manning, has long been an advocate for investor protection. He actively campaigned to abolish the long-standing practice of "dealer-first," whereby a broker/dealer buys or sells shares ahead of, and sometimes in direct conflict with, the interests of a client. He saw the practice as fraudulent and detrimental to investors.
The 1994 decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ban NASDAQ brokers from trading ahead of customer-limit orders had its roots in a court case begun by Mr. Manning in 1984. Since that decision, "Manning Rule" notices have been distributed to millions of securities holders and are now included in most new account literature.

Featured Product: Manning & Napier Fund, Inc. Strategic Income Series

April 11, 2017  |  Active Management






Today’s environment has become increasingly challenging for investors that are reliant on income generation. Economic growth in the U.S. and abroad remains sluggish, valuations for both fixed income and equity securities have become less compelling, forward return expectations are relatively muted, and interest rates along with bond yields remain near historically low levels.
Against this backdrop, income generation opportunities have become scarcer and finding suitable investment options that meet the needs of today’s income-oriented investors has become more challenging. At Manning & Napier, we understand that reaching investment objectives utilizing the more traditional approaches available for income-oriented investors (e.g., a simple balanced portfolio consisting of 50% stocks and 50% bonds) has become difficult. Furthermore, simply reaching for the highest yielding securities in an effort to generate a stronger income stream is risky, as higher yield is typically reflective of higher risk. With all the challenges that currently exist, it is important to consider alternative portfolio options that seek to provide sustainability of income and aim to meet investor needs over time.
Manning & Napier’s Strategic Income Conservative and Strategic Income Moderate Series are multi-asset class portfolios that seek to address the challenges in today’s market environment and act as alternatives to the more traditional yield-seeking strategies found in the marketplace. The Strategic Income Conservative Series is intended for investors who have current income needs, a shorter investment horizon, and less ability to withstand market volatility. The Strategic Income Moderate Series is intended for investors who have current income needs and a relatively long investment horizon.
There are four considerations that play a key role in the management process of the Series, which we believe are necessary for income-focused investors navigating today’s environment:

Duration management
    Duration is a bond’s price sensitivity to a change in interest rates expressed as a number of years. Bonds with longer durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds with shorter durations. In a rising interest rate environment—such as what we may experience going forward—longer duration bonds could experience heavy losses, especially if interest rates spike. Conversely, shorter duration bonds are less sensitive to rising interest rates and can help mitigate losses resulting from higher rates.
Credit management
    Moving beyond the relative safety of U.S. Treasuries may be a viable option for investors seeking to increase current portfolio yield. Credit investments can include corporate debt options ranging from investment-grade to high yield. Utilizing high yield debt in a portfolio can be an important tool, but the key is using it in the proper manner at the right time. While high yield fixed income securities have historically provided strong returns, the potential for significant losses within this asset class is a reality that investors could face at various points in the market cycle. This necessitates an active approach to managing credit exposure, weighing the risks and opportunities that characterize the prevailing market environment.
Equity dividends
    An allocation to dividend-paying stocks can be another important tool utilized by investors who are looking for alternative ways to generate income, as dividends have played a meaningful role in overall stock returns over the long run. Not all dividend-paying companies are equal, however. It is important to have a framework for evaluating the merits of individual companies from an income perspective, as well as more importantly, from a fundamental investment perspective. Investors should look for companies with sustainable dividends, growing dividends, and/or special
    situations (e.g., income-generating securities that are compellingly valued due to unique market conditions).
Diversification into other income sources
    Real estate in the form of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) can provide another source of income for investors. REITs are required by the IRS to pay out at least 90% of their income to shareholders, meaning REITs can provide higher yields than those typically found in the traditional fixed income markets. Another one of the attractive elements from a diversification perspective is that real estate may provide a natural hedge against inflation, as rents can be reset higher in an improving, inflationary economy. REITs are certainly not risk-free, so it is important to be selective when targeting the sector.

We believe that taking these key considerations into account when managing the Strategic Income Conservative and Moderate Series enables us to manage risk for our clients while pursuing both growth and income generation opportunities. Diversifying beyond the more traditional income-oriented approaches can provide attractive alternatives to investors looking to generate income in today’s yield-starved world.

A Word About Strategic Income Series Risk
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. An investment in the Series will fluctuate in response to stock market movements and changes in interest rates. Because the Series invests in a combination of other affiliated funds, it is subject to asset allocation risk as well as the risks associated with each underlying fund’s investment portfolio. These may include the risk that dividends may be discontinued or decreased; small-cap/mid-cap risk, including the risk that stocks of small- and mid-cap companies may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than the stocks of larger companies and may be less marketable than the stocks of larger companies; risks related to investments in options, which, like all derivatives, can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk; risks related to the direct ownership of real estate (including REITs) such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and changes in property value, among others; foreign investment risk, including fluctuating currency values, different accounting standards, and economic and political instability, as well as the risk that investments in emerging markets may be more volatile than investments in developed markets; issuer-specific risk; and the increased default risk associated with higher-yielding, lower-rated securities. There is an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates; as interest rates rise, bond prices (and therefore the value of bond funds) fall. Likewise, as interest rates fall, bond prices and the value of bond funds rise. Additionally, a portion of the Series’ underlying holdings may be invested in business development companies (BDCs) or master limited partnerships (MLPs). BDCs are subject to additional risks, as they generally invest in less mature private companies or thinly traded U.S. public companies which involve greater risk than well-established publicly-traded companies. MLPs are subject to additional risks, including, risks associated with the specific industry or industries in which the partnership invests, such as the risks of investing in real estate, or oil and gas industries or other natural resources. Moreover, the potential tax benefits from investing in MLPs depend on their continued treatment as partnerships for federal income tax purposes.
The Manning & Napier Fund, Inc. is managed by Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC. Manning & Napier Investor Services, Inc., an affiliate of Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC, is the distributor of the Fund shares.
