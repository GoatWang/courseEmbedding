Whiting Petroleum (WLL): What Will Q2 Earnings Unveil?


July 21, 2017, 10:53:00 AM EDT

 Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corp. WLL  is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Jul 26. In the preceding three-month period, the Denver, CO-based company reported stronger-than-expected results on robust output and cost control. Coming to earnings surprise history, Whiting Petroleum has a mixed record: its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters.  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise     Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Whiting Petroleum Corporation Quote  Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors to Consider This Quarter  Oil prices have been on a freefall over the past few weeks, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold. This will hamper Whiting Petroleum's earnings and cash flows However, efficiencies on the production front might be able to mitigate some of the damage. The company expects to maintain a flat-to-rising production profile in the upcoming few quarters despite asset sales. Moreover, Whiting Petroleum has been able to reduce costs that will provide some buffer amid the tumbling commodity prices.  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  . That is not the case here as you will see below.   Zacks ESP:   Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -5.26%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged narrower, at a loss of 19 cents.  Zacks Rank:  Whiting Petroleum's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us less confident of an earnings surprise call. As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Share Performance:  Shares have fallen 41.8% during the second quarter, as against the industry's  loss of 16.9%. Over the last 12 months, Whiting Petroleum stock has lost 37.4%.     Stocks to Consider  While earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy firms you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter: TransCanada Corp. TRP  has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The energy infrastructure developer is expected to release earnings results on Jul 28. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   . Halliburton Co. HAL  has an Earnings ESP of +10.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oilfield services provider is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 24. EQT Corp. EQT  has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oil and gas company is likely to release earnings on Jul 27.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.

Is the Market About to Have a Freak-Out Moment After Multiple Oil Inventory Draws?


July 19, 2017, 04:30:00 PM EDT
By Matthew DiLallo, Motley Fool










































 For the third straight week, data from the U.S. Energy   Information Administration showed that the amount of oil the   country has in storage had fallen. Further, these declines have   been much deeper than the market had expected. This week, for   example, crude oil storage inventories fell 4.7 million barrels   from last week. Not only was that better than the 3.2 million   barrel inventory draw that analysts had expected, but it   completely contradicted an earlier report by the American   Petroleum Institute showing that crude inventories spiked by 1.6   million barrels this week. That said, instead of applauding the news, oil traders   shrugged, evidenced by the slight rise in the U.S. oil benchmark   WTI, which edged up slightly more than 1% to around $47 per   barrel. Oil traders had the same reaction yesterday after a   report out of Saudi Arabia indicated that the country was   considering cutting its oil exports by another 1 million barrels   per day (bpd). While oil initially popped on the news, that   rally didn't go very far because oil traders remain skeptical.   That said, this skepticism could be lulling them into believing   that we're in a go-nowhere market. Because of that, it's growing   increasingly possible that oil traders could go into a frenzy if   they get caught off-guard by an unexpected barrage of bullish   news.   Image source: Getty Images. Lulled to sleep by lackluster data Even with today's rise, crude remains well below the   mid-$50 a barrel level that the market expected   to see this year    . Three factors have been weighing on    oil   prices    this year: weaker oil demand growth in the first quarter, a rapid   rise in shale output, and increasing production from Libya and   Nigeria, which are exempt from OPEC's cuts. Because of these   factors, crude oil inventories haven't drained as quickly as OPEC   expected. In fact, according to the EIA, even with this week's   significant draw, they remain in the upper half of the average   range for this time of year. Meanwhile, there have been some recent hiccups in OPEC's   efforts to cap its production. Last month, OPEC's production   surged 720,000 bpd thanks to growth from not only Libya and   Nigeria, but an unexpected rise from Saudi Arabia. Because of   that, OPEC's compliance with its cuts fell to 78% in June.   Meanwhile, Ecuador recently said that it no longer plans to hold   up its end of the bargain and cap its production at 520,000 bpd   because it needs the money. It's issues like these that have oil   traders largely ignoring an equally healthy dose of bullish news   in recent weeks. In fact, oil traders have been cutting their speculative bets   over the past few months. According to data from the U.S.   Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), after peaking at   more than 550,000 contracts in late February, market speculators   only held 358,000 contracts as of mid-July. With participation   from market speculators waning, it could lead to a significant   spike in volatility if traders get caught flat-footed by a   barrage of bullish news in the coming months because it could   cause a torrent of buying to both take bullish positions and   cover short ones.

Missing the forest for the trees One reason to believe market traders could get blindsided   is that the bullish data set extends far beyond a three-week   stretch where oil inventories have been draining at a healthy   clip. One of the most important data points is that "there was a   dramatic acceleration" in oil demand last quarter, according to   the International Energy Agency's latest market report. Overall,   demand grew by 1.5 million bpd during the second quarter after   only expanding by an average of 1 million bpd during the first   quarter. This spike caused the Agency to bump up its full-year   forecast by 100,000 bpd to 1.4 million bpd. Meanwhile, the rapid rise in shale output might be slowing   down. That seems to be the indication of the latest rig count   report by oil-field services giant   Baker Hughes    (NYSE: BHGE) , which showed that the U.S. rig count flattened out   last week. That's the second time in three weeks that Baker   Hughes' rig count data didn't show a gain, which is worth   noting since the rig count rose for a record 23 straight weeks   earlier this year. That data seems to suggest that shale drillers   are making good on their promise   not to drill themselves into oblivion    . However, what could push the crude market over the top if   shale drillers announce budget cuts and downward guidance   revisions when they report second-quarter results in the coming   weeks. Several drillers were banking on $55 oil when they set   their budgets, and they now might need to reset expectations   given where oil is these days. One candidate is leading   Bakken Shale    producer   Whiting Petroleum    (NYSE: WLL) . The company has been ramping up its drilling   activities this year after doubling its capital budget to $1.1   billion. That money would enable Whiting Petroleum to run enough   rigs to increase its output 23% by the end of the year. However,   given that Whiting has $1.5 billion in debt coming due starting   in 2019, and it needs $55 oil to balance the budget, it can't   afford to keep drilling at its current pace, making a spending   cut all the more likely. Is a flat-footed freak-out moment on the horizon? If several shale drillers announce that they're pulling back   the reins on their ambitious growth plans, it will signal that   U.S. supplies are starting to top out. Combine that with   continued robust demand growth and the potential for deeper   inventory declines if OPEC gets its act together, and it could   shake oil traders out of their slumber. Given the enormous drop   in speculative positions, it's possible that oil prices could   rally sharply in the second half as traders reposition. It's a   rise that would likely take oil stocks up with it, potentially   making now a great time to buy top-tier producers as well as   service companies like Baker Hughes since they should ride that   wave higher.   10 stocks we like better than Baker Hughes a GE     Co.

Whiting Petroleum: I'm Expecting Some Big Changes - Whiting Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:WLL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Whiting Petroleum: I'm Expecting Some Big ChangesJul.17.17 | About: Whiting Petroleum (WLL) Daniel Jones Deep Value, value, contrarian, special situationsSummaryIn this article, I decided to look at Whiting Petroleum and what I believe will soon happen.In their second-quarter earnings results, investors shouldn't be surprised to see some changes regarding their capex program.However, there are a few other items of significance that investors should be on the lookout for.On July 26th, after the market closes, the management team at Whiting Petroleum (WLL) intends to release financial results for the second quarter of the business's 2017 fiscal year. For several months now (the day after OPEC announced production cuts last year), I have owned shares of the company and it has been a more material part of my portfolio at that. Given all that has happened and based on what I have seen from the firm recently, I figured it would be interesting to give my thoughts on what, precisely, I anticipate for the business, come this earnings release. Expect higher capex but a possible downward revision According to management, Whiting should allocate around $1.1 billion toward capital expenditures this year, most of which will be needed to keep production flat (management said that 2017 production can be kept flat with around $900 million in capex) while the rest will increase it year over year. Just as a simple rule of math, if management intends to uphold this promise, the E&P firm must ramp spending up quite a bit at some point this year. This is because, during the first quarter of 2017, Whiting spent just $185.8 million on capital projects. This leaves $914.2 million to be split apart between three quarters, which boils down to $304.73 million per quarter. Of course, this is unlikely to be even each quarter but, at some stage, the spending must flow through. Actually, because of this expectation, I would also argue that, for the quarter, Whiting is likely to be cash-flow negative and may end up having to draw on their $2.5-billion credit facility. All of this said, however, I do think there's a small chance that management may make a bold announcement during the quarter. While energy prices have shown some signs of recovery, the fact remains that Whiting is cash-flow negative at current prices. Given that management scaled back capex in 2016, spending just $554 million for the year, I wouldn't be surprised if the firm ended up revising down how much it will spend this year in order to keep output flat or to grow it more slowly than anticipated. I do think this one, unlike in the capex call above it, is not terribly likely but I wouldn't be shocked if management decided to preserve some of their capital for better days ahead.
 Production should be strong Assuming that management does spend more on drilling and completion activities for the second quarter, I suspect that Whiting bulls could be in for a positive surprise regarding output. You see, during the first quarter of this year, the management team reported production of 10.56 million boe (barrels of oil equivalent). This represents a nice increase over the 10.4 million boe at the midpoint that management had forecast for the quarter and is a sign that, even as capex was a small fraction of where it should be in the quarters to come (if management does not cut their target), the company's impressive well performance could have positive results. In their first-quarter press release, the company stated that they believe output during the second quarter of this year will total 10.5 million boe. Since capex should probably be materially higher this quarter than in the first quarter, and despite the time lags associated with when drilling begins compared to when oil starts to flow (government data suggests about two months for a delay), I would be astonished if we didn't see a nice move above the midpoint of the guidance for a second straight quarter. A look at lease operating expenses The last prediction I have regarding Whiting relates to the company's lease operating expenses. This is one of their most significant cash-based costs, as it is with all E&P firms. Well, if my thoughts are in the right place, I would imagine that this quarter, Whiting should perform reasonably well on this front. Before I explain precisely why, allow me to state that I am going against the grain on this one. You see, as E&P firms drill more, just as Whiting has done, some of their operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, should rise. This is, quite simply, due to increased activity and the fact that firms in this space are showing signs of drilling in spots that are no longer considered prime real estate. If anything, you would expect lease operating expenses, as well as other cost categories, to worsen, but I believe there's a reasonable basis supporting the opposite.
 For the first quarter, Whiting's management team expected the firm's midpoint range for lease operating expenses would come in at $9 per boe. This was from a range of $8.50 per boe to $9.50 per boe. However, strong performance by the E&P operator pushed this number down to $8.56 per boe, which is very near the lowest point of this range. To put this in perspective, the difference between what they achieved and their midpoint guidance for the first quarter, at 10.56 million boe, would total $4.65 million in just one quarter. If applied to a full year, we are looking at extra savings of nearly $18.59 million. During these tough times in the energy space, especially after seeing prices take a beating following OPEC's failure to cut production further, management will be incentivized to generate as much in the form of cost-savings as possible. What's more, after seeing such a drastic drop compared to their midpoint range in the first quarter, it appears to be quite clear that management does not have a full understanding of their ability to reduce expenses. Otherwise, they would have been closer to their target. Takeaway Based on the data provided, I must say that I am looking forward to Whiting's second-quarter earnings release. I suspect that, while costs may be higher year over year on a per-boe basis, the overall picture facing the firm will be fairly good. Yes, capital expenditures will likely push cash flow into the red, but I believe that the market already expects this. Investors do not, however, expect stronger output and lower-than-forecast operating expenses. If my call here is accurate, then it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect a nice move higher in Whiting's share price as well.

Russia's Refusal to Consider Deeper Production Cuts Upends Crude Oil's Winning Streak
Shale stocks took the brunt of the sell-off after crude closed down by more than 4%.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 5, 2017 at 6:46PM
            
            





What happened
The oil market's longest winning streak in 10 months came to an abrupt halt Wednesday. After rising in each of the past eight trading sessions, crude tripped over comments by Russia that it would oppose deeper supply cuts beyond its existing agreement with OPEC. Those remarks, along with data showing rising OPEC exports and a stronger U.S. dollar, knocked crude down 4.1% on the day to around $45 a barrel, which was its biggest drop in a month.
The sell-off in the oil market hit shale-focused stocks hard. According to data from S&P Market Intelligence, shale drillers Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) and Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO) led the way down, both slumping more than 10% on the day. Meanwhile, frack sand producers and service companies also sold off on the news, with Fairmount Santrol (NYSE:FMSA), Smart Sand (NASDAQ:SND), and Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) dropping around 10% on the day.

So what
Russia's instance that it won't reduce its output any further could force shale drillers to start pulling back on their growth plans. One of the most likely shale drillers to pull the plug on its growth ambitions is Whiting Petroleum. The Bakken Shale-focused driller currently plans to spend $1.1 billion on new wells this year, which is nearly double what it spent last year. As a result of that spending increase, the company expects its production to rise 24% by the end of the year. That said, Whiting Petroleum needs oil to average $55 a barrel to finance that plan within cash flow. Given where the price of crude is these days, and the fact that it has $1.5 billion of debt maturing in the coming years, analysts expect the company to scale back on its plans, so it doesn't drill itself any deeper into debt.
Carrizo Oil & Gas is another shale driller that's planning to grow aggressively this year despite a weak balance sheet. Initially, the company planned to boost its oil output 27% this year, despite having a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.3 times at the end of the first quarter, which is well above the 2.0 times industry average. Carrizo Oil and Gas has since increased that growth guidance to 39% after announcing a $648 million acquisition, which it partially financed by issuing another $250 million high-yield debt. Given that the company is outspending cash flow at current oil prices and it has a stretched balance sheet, Carrizo might need to pull back on its growth plans, especially since Russia won't cut any more production to provide additional support for oil prices.
The industry faces a catch-22 at the moment. Shale drillers need to start pulling back on completing new wells to boost oil prices since Russia and OPEC are unlikely to provide additional support. However, if shale drillers do pull back, it will likely tamp down demand for frack sand produced by Fairmount Santrol and Smart Sand as well as for Nabors Industries' fracking services. That would be bad news for these companies because Fairmount Santrol and Smart Sand had hoped that demand would continue growing, which would enable them to raise prices. Likewise, Nabors Industries needs demand for its services to keep growing so it can also push through price increases and boost profitability.





Now what
Shale drillers had been holding out hope that the Russian-OPEC alliance would cave in and reduce their output further to boost prices so that U.S. drillers won't have to slow their drilling pace. However, with Russia refusing to consider a deeper cut, it's growing more likely that shale drillers will need to slow their pace, which would cause demand for frack sand and fracking services to fall. Given this uncertainty, investors are better off steering clear of financially weak producers and service providers at the moment because they'll likely feel the brunt of any future pullback in shale drilling.

The trailer brilliantly uses Michael Jackson's Thriller and Vincent Price's spooky voiceover to set the mood, and it worked. Will, it seems, has been changed by his time in the upside down and is caught between realms. The mysterious girl with mysterious powers shows up at the end of the teaser, and it looks as if she's found a way to get out of the Upside Down.
"As we'd been forewarned about the Netflix hit's fresh episodes (dropping Friday, Oct. 27), the clip confirms what Noah Schnapp (Will) called the "darker and more eerie" tone of the series" sophomore season."Darkness falls across the lands... here is the first trailer for #Stranger Things2", the Stranger Things account captioned the video on Twitter.The sci-fi series is set to return to Netflix on October 31.Check out the full trailer for Stranger Things 2 below.

In response to all the issues Niantic has said that they will be refunding the $20 entrance fee as well as giving out $100 worth of PokeCoins. In the game, Raid Battles are both luck and numbers and the player would want to have the best strategy to defeat this powerful monster. Fans of the game have been asking for legendary monsters to be included in the game's official roster, and it appears that players can get their hands on legendary monsters at "Pokemon GO" Fest this July 22. The tickets they were there to purchase sold out in less than 10 minutes, while skyrocketing prices online soared as high as $450 on eBay and other sites. Hopefully, there will be a great turn out and no technical slowdowns when more Pokémon GO Fests are announced. "We can't play" and "fix the game" chants interrupted his comments throughout.
Legendary Pokemon Eggs will have a small chance of appearing in Pokemon gyms and when players defeat a legendary raid boss, they will have a small chance of catching a legendary Pokemon.Also, all the attendees of the Pokemon Go Fest at the Chicago's Grant Park will get one Lugia automatically to call their own.
Storms knock out power to several homes in Missouri and IL 
					Almost 50,000 homes and businesses in Missouri and 39,000 in IL were without power during the peak of the storms. KCP&L says at the height of the storm almost 115,000 customers were without power.
				When asked what went wrong, Niantic Chief Marketing Officer Mike Quigley stated, "We don't know right now".
Chicago organizers had hyped the event for weeks because of attendees' ability to "unlock" in-game bonuses and even see the unveiling of the first-ever "Legendary Pokemon". "Everyone who has successfully checked in will receive Lugia in your account", she said.

All concerned in the privacy dispute on Friday agreed that it might be best to wait till the issue was settled by the nine-judge bench hearing the challenge to Aadhar on the grounds that privacy was a fundamental right. The bench posted the matter for hearing in the first week of September, by which time Justice Dipak Misra would be the CJI. "Where is the question of maintainability?". This data includes photographs, messages, pictures shared by the users on WhatsApp. "Why only two petitioners have problems with WhatsApp when similar datasharing is going on on all platforms?"

So it is fitting that he gets his chance at virtual reality as well. It's such a huge honor.

				When asked about how he prepared for the film, Spielberg just answered as you'd expect anyone with his experience to. This initial look at the upcoming adaptation of Ernest Cline's hit novel is action-packed, nearly as much as it's packed with the kind of pop culture references that fill the book."What made me want to tell the story more than anything else, was the kind of world 2045 gives to people, which is so dystopian", Steven said during the panel (via THR).
USS Gerald R. Ford to be commissioned Saturday
				Trump will preside over Saturday's ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk, during which the USS Ford will formally join the fleet. He was followed shortly by Susan Ford Bales, the ship's sponsor and daughter of the 38th president, whom the ship honors.

Whiting Petroleum (WLL): What Will Q2 Earnings Unveil?


July 21, 2017, 10:53:00 AM EDT
By Nilanjan Choudhury, Zacks.com

 Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corp. WLL  is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Jul 26. In the preceding three-month period, the Denver, CO-based company reported stronger-than-expected results on robust output and cost control. Coming to earnings surprise history, Whiting Petroleum has a mixed record: its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters.  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise     Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Whiting Petroleum Corporation Quote  Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors to Consider This Quarter  Oil prices have been on a freefall over the past few weeks, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold. This will hamper Whiting Petroleum's earnings and cash flows However, efficiencies on the production front might be able to mitigate some of the damage. The company expects to maintain a flat-to-rising production profile in the upcoming few quarters despite asset sales. Moreover, Whiting Petroleum has been able to reduce costs that will provide some buffer amid the tumbling commodity prices.  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  . That is not the case here as you will see below.   Zacks ESP:   Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -5.26%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged narrower, at a loss of 19 cents.  Zacks Rank:  Whiting Petroleum's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us less confident of an earnings surprise call. As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Share Performance:  Shares have fallen 41.8% during the second quarter, as against the industry's  loss of 16.9%. Over the last 12 months, Whiting Petroleum stock has lost 37.4%.     Stocks to Consider  While earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy firms you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter: TransCanada Corp. TRP  has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The energy infrastructure developer is expected to release earnings results on Jul 28. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   . Halliburton Co. HAL  has an Earnings ESP of +10.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oilfield services provider is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 24. EQT Corp. EQT  has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oil and gas company is likely to release earnings on Jul 27.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
