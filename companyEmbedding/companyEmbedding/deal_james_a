  Nike has signed LeBron James to a lifetime deal, ESPN's
  Darren Rovell reports.

  The contract is the largest single-athlete deal in Nike's 44-year
  history. It also marks the first time that Nike has officially
  given a lifetime deal.

  James, who is 30 and 
  entering a new phase of his career, signed a seven-year, $90
  million contract with Nike before he was drafted by the Cleveland
  Cavaliers in 2003. In 2010, James re-signed with Nike and
  reportedly 
  earned as much as $30 million annually.

  According to Rovell, LeBron's new deal "easily surpasses" the
  10-year, $300 million deal Kevin Durant signed with Nike in 2014.

  SportsOneSource reports that James has had his own signature shoe
  line with Nike since his rookie season, and sales of his shoe
  were the highest among active players at $340 million per year,
  according to
  Forbes.





  As Fortune's
  Daniel Roberts notes, James' deal with Nike is the latest in
  a series of successful business ventures. Last week, he landed a
  $15.8 million investment from Time Warner Cable in his media
  company.
Rovell
  also noted that Nike and James discussed possibly breaking
  out James' brand separately from the Nike basketball umbrella,
  but ultimately decided against it.

Most people can't imagine James Bond drinking anything other than his signature vodka martini (shaken not stirred). But the international man of mystery is going to be sipping Heineken, again, in the upcoming Bond flick "Skyfall."
While some fans cry "sacrilege," this isn't the first time Bond has strayed from martinis.
In the very first Bond movie, "Dr. No," Bond perched at a bar beside a Red Stripe. He's also imbibed various brands of vodka, sodas, and other prominently labeled beverages.
For "Skyfall," Bond will be seen with a mall full of different brands, covering everything from Coke Zero, to Sony Vaio. The Heineken tie-in is one of the largest product placement packages in history.
To give you a sense of just how big of a deal product placement is for James Bond, we put together a short history of product placement throughout the lifespan of the movie franchise.

ukdeNow ReadingLeBron James Has Made HOW Much For Nike?LeBron James Has Made HOW Much For Nike?Liza DarwinPhoto: Courtesy of Nike.Whether you've already filled out your March Madness bracket or couldn't care less about basketball, you likely know of LeBron James. The Cleveland Cavaliers forward has proven himself to be an MVP — and he has the championships to prove it. Arguably just as impressive as his skills on the court is his incredible ability to sell Nike sneakers. According to Forbes, the 30-year-old Ohio native is the biggest endorsement star in basketball, pulling in over $340 million last year in sales for his signature LeBron for Nike shoes. And, per usual, he's smoking the competition. Citing stats from SpotScanInfo, Forbes says James' sales are up about 13% from 2013, and he currently pushes twice as many sneakers as second-place baller Kevin Durant. Furthermore, this year marks James' 12th season working with Nike — the company first signed him fresh out of high school with a $90 million contract. Not too shabby for a teen.The earnings he's posted for Nike don't even reflect the shadow market of sneaker resales. Resellable celebrity-endorsed sneakers are one of the most profitable fashion investments one can make. And, at $200 a pop, the signature LeBron 12s get snatched up by sneakerheads immediately, and resold for hundreds more. Clearly, this is one king with the golden touch. So, while we wait to see if his success for Nike leads to more fashion deals down the line, we may also want to consider getting in on the sneaker action.

Lebron James inks multi-million dollar endorsement deal with Dunkin Donuts in Asia... but will he eat the pork donuts?

Scored a deal: Dunkin' Donuts is the latest in a long list of endorsement deals that Lebron James has inked
Executives at Dunkin Donuts are hoping to make China run on Dunkin’ and using Lebron James to help by signing an endorsement deal with the basketball star. Dunkin' Brands Inc. said Monday that NBA superstar Lebron James has agreed to promote Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream in Asia where the company has about a third of its stores.The company is hoping to cater to the eastern market by creating different savory products for the various countries. One example of a locally-inspired menu item would be pork donuts in China, and though they may not be palatable to Americans or Europeans, it will certainly show the company's understanding of the nation's preferences, where it aims to open another 100 stores in the next two to three years.James will promote Dunkin's brands in China, Taiwan, India and South Korea through advertisements, online media and in-store marketing, so he may well be testing out the new pork donuts while on promotional visits. 'Donuts are a very flexible product. You can do savory donuts, you can do donuts with shredded pork -- that's in China,' said CEO Nigel Travis.'We also have a range of other savory products that we have been testing and introducing country by country.'Getting the menu right in each market is critical. Pork donuts, for example, are not likely to sell well in Indonesia and Malaysia, where people are predominantly Muslim.James will also make personal 
appearances in Asia after the season ends in June, which is sure to 
increase profits for the company as the 27-year-old is very popular in 
the region.  



International appeal: At present, a third of the company's stores are in Asia- like this store in Shanghai- and they are due to add 250 more in the next 2-3 years
Dunkin' 
executive John Costello would not elaborate on the specific terms of the
 deal, but said it was multiyear and worth multimillions of dollars.‘I'm
 really excited about partnering with Dunkin' Brands and connecting with
 the huge community of basketball fans’ in Asia, James said in a 
statement.

James, a two-time
 NBA Most Valuable Player, has the best-selling basketball jersey and 
shoe in China and has visited Asia four times.This endorsement deal comes on top of a number of others that help James earn between $25million and $30million per year.    



Open for business: Seen here at a charity event sponsored by Sprite- with whom James has an endorsement deal- the NBA star makes anywhere between $25m-$30m per year
   



Brand ambassador: James has long had a contract with Nike, and has nine signature shoes by the company
Fast
 food has been profitable for the player in the past, as he has a 
long-term contract with McDonalds already underway, as well as other 
food and drink deals with Sprite, Glacéau and Bubblicious.DUNKIN' AROUND THE WORLDThere are over 10,000 Dunkin' Donuts shops worldwide in 32 countries. This figure puts them in the same league- though still vastly outnumbered- as Starbucks which has 17,009 locations. The brand's headquarters are in Canton, Massachusetts, and unsurprisingly the chain is seen most frequently in the Northeast of the United States.In the home state alone there are 294 locations. Moving west of the Mississippi River, however, there are only 75 franchises. That number is sure to increase in the coming years as the company announced that it plans to triple its total size. A large amount of those locations are going to come in the U.S. as it plans to have 15,000 stores by 2020. They also plan to expand outside of the U.S., with expected openings in the Ukraine, India, Brazil and Costa Rica. But given their endorsement plans with Lebron James, it comes as no surprise that much of their attention will be focused on Asia. The company plans to open 250 stores throughout the continent in the next two to three years, 100 of which will be in China. 
China
 is the NBA's second-biggest market after the U.S., and NBA players 
often visit Asia on behalf of shoe companies or other sponsors during 
the offseason.
Dunkin' is hoping James' popularity 
will help boost sales in a region where it has about 5,400 stores, or 
about a third of its global total. 
The company plans to add at least 250
 stores in Asia during the next two to three years- 100 of which are 
expected to be in China, chief executive Nigel Travis said.Dunkin' opened its first restaurant in
 Vietnam in December and plans to open its inaugural store in India 
later this year, Mr Travis said. South Korea has the most Dunkin' stores
 in Asia with about 1,900 while Japan has 1,087 - all Baskin-Robbins.The James deal ‘is Asia focused and reflects our commitment to Asia,’ Mr Travis told reporters in Singapore. ‘Lebron has a strong commitment to 
building his relationship in Asia so he's definitely planning multiple 
trips to Asia in the offseason this year.’The popularity of basketball in Asia 
has grown during the last decade, in part because of former Houston 
Rockets center Yao Ming of China, who retired last year. New
 York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin has become an overnight sensation in Asia,
 especially in China and Taiwan. Lin, whose parents were born in Taiwan,
 is the first Asia-American player in the NBA.Mr Costello said Dunkin is happy to have snagged James, who has been an All-Star for eight seasons.  



 



 



 
Appealing to the Asian market: Retired star Yao Ming (left) and Asian American phenomenon Jeremy Lin (center) are big hits in Asia, but Lebron James (right) is extremely popular in the region as wellLin
 ‘certainly is an exciting new player with 20 games to his history,’ 
said Mr Costello, who is Dunkin's chief global marketing and innovation 
officer.
‘But Lebron James 
has had a fabulous nine years. We think the excitement around Jeremy Lin
 will actually create more awareness in Asia.’
James,
 27, is in his ninth NBA season since turning professional straight out 
of high school. His team, the Miami Heat, lost in last year's finals to 
the Dallas Mavericks.

LeBron James was sixth on Forbes‘ highest-paid athletes list in 2015 with an income of $64.8 million, and he just signed a colossal lifetime deal with Nike that will ensure he’s one of the richest athletes in the world for decades to come.
ESPN first reported Monday that James agreed to a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike that “easily surpasses” Kevin Durant’s recent 10-year, $300 million deal.
In 2003, James signed a 7-year, $90-million deal with Nike one month before the Cleveland Cavaliers selected James with the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, and then signed a new deal with the company in 2010. The numbers are gaudy, but James is clearly worth it. In a 12-month span from 2015, Nike sold $340 million worth of LeBron shoes.
James’ lifetime contract is the largest guaranteed deal in Nike history.
Nike confirmed the deal in a statement.
“We can confirm that we have agreed to a lifetime relationship with LeBron that provides significant value to our business, brand and shareholders. We have already built a strong LeBron business over the past 12 years, and we see the potential for this to continue to grow throughout his playing career and beyond.”
So what does this mean for LeBron long-term? Well, Michael Jordan made more money ($90 million) in 2013 than every single athlete other than Floyd Mayweather, and in 2015 earned more than he did over his entire NBA career.
It also means we’ll have a lifetime supply of awesome LeBron commercials.


Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James, Money, Nike, NBA

Copa Di Vino, "an arrow to my heart, the pain I suffer when I hear that name," Kevin O'Leary told ABC News.

O'Leary remembers Copa Di Vino as the one that got away.

"I'm very frustrated with that guy," O'Leary said. "Whatever he's doing, I could make it twice the size."

Copa Di Vino founder James Martin is one of the most disliked entrepreneurs of ABC's hit show "Shark Tank," but he is also one of the most successful.

Martin created Copa Di Vino, a portfolio of seven different types of wine that come in a patented glass-like container made out of recycled plastic with a pull-off and resealable lid.

Copa Di Vino promises an on-the-go premium glass of wine without worrying about wasting wine or dealing with a stubborn corkscrew.

Martin's Oregon-based and family-owned winery struggled for years before making a profit. When the opportunity arose to appear on the second season of "Shark Tank," Martin jumped at the possibility for potential investors and additional expertise.

"At that point we had just started the company and we're desperately in need of some cash," Martin told ABC News. "We thought it was a perfect fit for the show and we were really excited to do it."

Martin asked for $600,000 in exchange for 30 percent of his business.

Kevin O'Leary expressed interest, but wanted Martin to separate the patent for the container from the process of bottling the wine. Martin wouldn't budge, telling O'Leary the wine glass was the "special sauce."

"I was so confident in my product that I thought for sure I would get the biggest deal that anyone got on this show," Martin told ABC News. "Instead, I got totally demolished."

The situation was tense in the shark tank after Martin walked out on the offers and brushed off their advice, Shark Barbara Corcoran told ABC News.

"He was arrogant, he didn't listen," Corcoran said. "Everyone was giving him good suggestions. He just dismissed it as though he was talking to no one. He made every shark hate him within minutes."

However, within minutes after his episode aired, Martin said his phone wouldn't stop ringing with people pitching him with offers to invest in his company.

"Today, at what shares trade in the business, that investment would be worth $12 million," Martin said. "That's a 20-times return on investment that they would have received in two and a half years."

The show producers took notice of Martin's overnight success, and offered Martin a rare second chance to go back in the tank.

The standoff between the sharks and Martin went into its second round when neither side budged on the very same point they were stuck on the first time around.

Martin was "the most obnoxious and most stubborn" entrepreneur they had on the show, shark Daymond John told ABC News.

"He was the first gold digger that we ever had," Mark Cuban told ABC News. "It was so obvious and that was when I said I'm out, this makes no sense."

Even though Martin walked away, again, without any of the sharks' investment, the chance to promote his product on national television had huge payoffs.

"The first time I was on the show, we had done about $500,000 in revenue," Martin said. "Today we've done over $25 million in revenue."

Although the sharks were left with distaste for wine bottled in a glass, there's no question of its popularity nationwide.

"We're on track to serve more wine than McDonald's serves cheeseburgers," Martin said.

Copa Di Vino now employs 150 employees and harvests 400 acres in the largest planting area in Oregon of Pinot Noir, he said.

"Stick to your vision, know your plan, know your business, and know your game," Martin offered as advice for budding entrepreneurs who may next step into the tank.

"Make sure no one undersells you even if they're a shark."

Product placement in pictures: SkyfallNovember 4, 2012|In movies|By Erik







A lot has been written about excessive and blatant product placement in the latest Bond movie Skyfall. But let me say somethingdifferent: product placement in Skyfall wasn’t excessive and wasn’t blatant. Actually it was more subtle than I’ve expected. Mind you, we’re still talking about James Bond movie, so there is a lot of products and brands integrated in the movie, but Skyfall is no Transformers or some other examples of product placement prostitution.
When the information about Heineken’s $45 million deal (roughly a third of Skyfall’s production budget) first surfaced, there were numerous articles and blog posts about James Bond selling out. We have to be honest, though. All Bond’s movies had product placement, some were more subtle and some were more blatant when it comes to brand integration. Also, David Leigh who runs website The James Bond Dossier said, that Bond has consumed a wide variety of beverages from the start, in both in his literary and cinematic incarnations.
So, what’s the fuss?
First, let’s check products and brands from Skyfall. [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]
Cars: Landrover, Audi, Beetle, Range Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin
Landrover Defender and Audi were seen in a car chase scene: Eve drove Landrover, while the bad guys tried to escape in Audi. During the chase a few VW Beetles fell from the train.
Range Rover was used to transport Bond to MI6’s new location and M and Bond used Jaguar XJ.
The legendary Aston Martin DB5 also made an important appearance, but I won’t reveal why :)
Aston Martin DB5 from Skyfall
Sony 
Skyfall was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. Columbia Pictures is owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, so the appearance of different Sony products should not be a coincidence. I have reviewed several movies, distributed by Sony Pictures and probably all of them included Sony’s brands.
Bond (or was it Q?) used Sony Vaio laptop (first seen in Casino Royale) and Sony Xperia T mobile phone. Nothing special or excessive there: only Vaio’s logo and a glimpse of the new Xperia.
Sony Vaio from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Macallan whisky
Macallan whisky was probably the most “in your face” placement. It occurred during the first meeting between Bond and Silva. The main villain offered James a drink, a 50-year old Macallan, because it’s his favorite drink.
Additionally, we saw M and Bond drinking Macallan on two different occasions.
Macallan whisky (on the desk) from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Heineken
The much hyped Heineken appeared in two scenes: Bond was lying in bed with a girl and we could see a bottle of Heineken in his hand. The other appearance was in a big office: Tanner, one of MI6 employees was sipping beer from Heineken bottle. That’s it. Nothing excessive.

Omega
We know that Bond wears Omega, but I couldn’t recognize his watch. Anyway, he wore a Seamaster model.
Omega Seamaster from Skyfall (2012, MGM and Columbia Pictures, screen capture)
Tom Ford
James Bond has been wearing Tom Ford for the second time. Similar as with Omega you can’t recognize the brand of his clothes – the fact that we know what he wears is just matter of clever/aggressive marketing campaign(s).
Bond also wore Tom Ford Marko TF144 sunglasses.
You can read more about James Bond’s clothing in the excellent blog post at Clothes on Film.

Walther PPK
Walther PPK pistol is a longtime Bond companion, but in Skyfall Q introduced an improved gun with a thumbprint code.

THE VERDICT
23rd Bond movie is very good. Even though Casino Royale remains my personal favorite, Skyfall is an improvement over Quantum of Solace. Also, Daniel Craig’s movies are vastly superior to Brosnan’s, Dalton’s and Moore’s. Bond is now more human and not a cartoon that would become if Pierce Brosnan stayed in his role.
Product placement used to be synonymous for Bond movies and has to be analyzed with that fact in mind. All Bond movies have got excessive product placement, but Bond was also a sexist, he delivered amusing one-lines, the majority of Bond girls had stupid names (Christmas Jones, Pussy Galore …) … to name just a few of Bond’s trademarks.
With everything taken into account, product placement in Skyfall was nicely done. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with it and I hope people will stop complaining about it.
Do you agree?

There was a rather needless close up of the Omega as Bond operated the Caterpillar diggar and Tanner drinking beer in the office was pretty unlikely if MI6 has gone the way of most British workplaces, but overall I agree with you.

Thanks Tom. I usually write blog posts after I watch a movie at home, but this time I went to the cinema and began writing the next day. I hoped I’d remember every brand in Skyfall, but I guess I failed :))

There was also Adidas, Bond wore these in the fitness test scene. Personally, I think the product placement in this film was tasteful and subtle, save for the VW brand (the Beetle scene was a bit much).

Most people don’t notice and don’t care about product placement! We see those products every day in real life, just like we see them in movies. It makes me wonder exactly how much the manufacturers increase sales by this, as opposed to how much it costs them to do it.

Regarding Omega again for a second it’s also worth noting that there is another example of very subtle product placement. It’s almost subliminal. During Bond’s pursuit of Silva in the subway there is an instance where Silva passes up two posters for Omega. One for the Seamaster Planet Ocean and another Seamaster model I believe. I saw Skyfall for the first time last night and picked up on this almost immediately. Very cleverly played
