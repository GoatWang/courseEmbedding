Press Releases
Rimini Street, Inc. and GP Investments Acquisition Corp. Announce Signing of Definitive Merger Agreement


5/16/2017


Transaction will provide Rimini Street additional growth capital to expand service offerings and capabilities, strengthen balance sheet, and fund potential acquisitions; Combined company to be named Rimini Street, Inc. and trade on NASDAQ as “RMNI”
LAS VEGAS and NEW YORK, May 16, 2017 - Rimini Street, Inc. ("Rimini Street" or the "Company") and GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: GPIA; GPIAW; GPIAU) ("GPIAC") have entered into a definitive merger agreement, which will result in the merger of Rimini Street with and into GPIAC. At closing of the transaction, GPIAC is expected to be renamed Rimini Street, Inc. and continue trading on NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol "RMNI." 
Rimini Street, founded in 2005, is the leading global provider of independent enterprise software support services. The Company provides subscription-based support services for software products licensed by Oracle Corporation, SAP SE and other software vendors. As of March 31, 2017, Rimini Street has reported annual run-rate revenues exceeding $196 million and has achieved a revenue CAGR of 37% since 2014. The Company employs approximately 900 professionals across 13 countries of operation, and currently serves over 1,200 clients - including nearly 100 of the Fortune 500 and Global 100.
GPIAC is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) created by GP Investments in May 2015 via an IPO that raised $172.5 million in proceeds for the purpose of investing in companies with long-term growth potential in the consumer and services sectors.
Upon transaction closing, Seth A. Ravin, founder, CEO and chairman of the board of directors of Rimini Street, will be appointed CEO and chairman of the board of directors of the combined entity. At closing, the board of directors of the combined entity is expected to consist of nine directors, of which seven (including Mr. Ravin) will be designated by Rimini Street and two will be designated by GPIAC.
"As a high-growth company capitalizing on a large, global addressable market, Rimini Street presents an attractive investment opportunity. The Company's client value proposition, seasoned management team, track record of execution and years of consecutive growth are very compelling," said Antonio Bonchristiano, CEO of GPIAC and GP Investments, Ltd. "Rimini Street is a proven innovator and market disruptor."
"Rimini Street has delivered 45 consecutive quarters of revenue growth by providing value-driven, innovative support solutions and exceptional service that meet the global needs of enterprise software licensees. The combination with GPIAC will provide Rimini Street additional growth capital to expand service offerings and capabilities, strengthen our balance sheet and fund potential acquisitions," said Mr. Ravin. "We believe that having a public company structure will further fuel our growth by facilitating additional sales opportunities and providing additional capital market access. We are pleased to enter into this transaction and work with GP Investments, Ltd. as a new investor and business partner with a proven track record of providing value to growth companies."
Transaction Details
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the transaction will be funded via the issuance of approximately 63.8 million shares of GPIAC common stock at $10.00 per share to Rimini Street’s shareholders. Cash at closing in GPIAC’s trust account and cash proceeds from the issuance of up to 3.5 million shares of GPIAC common stock at $10.00 per share to an affiliate of GP Investments, Ltd. will provide required cash at closing used to pay certain transaction expenses, reduce net debt and provide additional balance sheet cash.
The anticipated initial enterprise value is approximately $837 million, implying a multiple of 2.8x 2018E revenue of $295 million, with a post-closing equity value of $854 million at $10.00 per share. At consummation of the transaction, a merger subsidiary of GPIAC will merge with and into Rimini Street, with Rimini Street as the surviving entity, which would then merge with and into GPIAC, which will move its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware prior to consummation.
After giving effect to the transaction and certain assumptions, current GPIAC shareholders are expected to own approximately 25% of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, and current Rimini Street shareholders will exchange their Rimini Street shares for approximately 75% pro forma ownership of the combined company.
The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is subject to approval of GPIAC and Rimini Street shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.  
Rimini Street shareholders representing a sufficient amount of Rimini Street's capital stock necessary to approve the transaction have entered into a transaction support and voting agreement pursuant to which they have agreed to support and vote all of their shares in favor of the transaction. In addition, at its previously announced extraordinary general meeting to be held on May 23, 2017, GPIAC shareholders of record at the close of business on April 24, 2017 must approve certain proposals relating to the proposed extension from May 26, 2017 to November 27, 2017, the date by which GPIAC must consummate an initial business combination.
Assuming receipt of such shareholder approvals, government approvals and satisfaction of all closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.
Citigroup served as financial and capital markets advisor to GPIAC. Cowen and Company served as financial and capital markets advisor to Rimini Street. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP acted as legal advisor to GPIAC, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati acted as legal advisor to Rimini Street.
Conference Call and Investor Presentation
GPIAC and Rimini Street will hold a conference call to discuss the transaction on Tuesday, May 16, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. EDT. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-855-327-6837 (domestic), or 1-631-891-4304 (international), and asking to join the GP Investments Acquisition Corp. conference call.

(NASDAQ:GPIA) (NASDAQ:GPIAW) (NASDAQ:GPIAU) ("GPIAC") today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire WKI Holding Company, Inc. ("World Kitchen"), the parent company of World Kitchen, LLC, a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of houseware products.  World Kitchen's portfolio of brands includes Corelle, Pyrex, CorningWare and Snapware, among others. The anticipated initial enterprise value is approximately $566 million, implying a multiple of 7.2x projected calendar year 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, and post-closing equity value of $330 million at $10.00 per share.  In connection with the acquisition, an affiliate of GP Investments, Ltd. will co-invest $50 million in the form of new GPIAC common stock at a price of $10.00 per share in cash.  At consummation of the transaction, GPIAC will move its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and is expected to be renamed World Kitchen Group, Inc. and to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol "WDKN". World Kitchen is a market leader in the attractive global housewares segment.  The company manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of iconic brands across a broad range of product categories, including dinnerware, bakeware, storage, cookware and cutlery.  World Kitchen's international footprint, distribution network, channel diversity and strong relationships with key retail partners sustains its leading positions in mature markets and positions it to drive growth in select high-growth emerging markets.  It employs more than 3,000 people globally, including 2,300 in the United States. "World Kitchen presents a unique investment opportunity, with significant long-term, high-growth potential," said Antonio Bonchristiano, CEO of GPIAC and GP Investments, Ltd.  "The company is a proven product innovator, with a diverse international footprint across retail, online and other channels.  We believe the company will be well positioned to continue and amplify the trend of organic growth, increase efficiencies as the business continues to scale, and take advantage of considerable sector consolidation opportunities."

GP Investments Acquisition Corp. to Acquire World Kitchen
Global marketplace provider of iconic Corelle, Pyrex, CorningWare and Snapware brands to list on NASDAQ



















April 19, 2016 09:24 ET

 | Source: GP Investments Acquisition Corp.






NEW YORK, April  19, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ:GPIA) (NASDAQ:GPIAW) (NASDAQ:GPIAU) ("GPIAC") today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire WKI Holding Company, Inc. ("World Kitchen"), the parent company of World Kitchen, LLC, a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of houseware products.  World Kitchen’s portfolio of brands includes Corelle, Pyrex, CorningWare and Snapware, among others. The anticipated initial enterprise value is approximately $566 million, implying a multiple of 7.2x projected calendar year 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, and post-closing equity value of $330 million at $10.00 per share.  In connection with the acquisition, an affiliate of GP Investments, Ltd. will co-invest $50 million in the form of new GPIAC common stock at a price of $10.00 per share in cash.  At consummation of the transaction, GPIAC will move its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware and is expected to be renamed World Kitchen Group, Inc. and to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol "WDKN". World Kitchen is a market leader in the attractive global housewares segment.  The company manufactures and markets a diverse portfolio of iconic brands across a broad range of product categories, including dinnerware, bakeware, storage, cookware and cutlery.  World Kitchen's international footprint, distribution network, channel diversity and strong relationships with key retail partners sustains its leading positions in mature markets and positions it to drive growth in select high-growth emerging markets.  It employs more than 3,000 people globally, including 2,300 in the United States. "World Kitchen presents a unique investment opportunity, with significant long-term, high-growth potential," said Antonio Bonchristiano, CEO of GPIAC and GP Investments, Ltd.  "The company is a proven product innovator, with a diverse international footprint across retail, online and other channels.  We believe the company will be well positioned to continue and amplify the trend of organic growth, increase efficiencies as the business continues to scale, and take advantage of considerable sector consolidation opportunities." “World Kitchen was seeking a strong, growth-oriented financial sponsor with access to public capital markets to partner with us in our next phase of growth,” said Carl Warschausky, President and CEO of World Kitchen, LLC.  “We are excited to work with GP Investments, Ltd., which has a proven track record of funding growth.  We look forward to accelerated organic growth and acquisitions in the years ahead.” Transaction Details Under the terms of the definitive agreement, the acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash and the issuance of approximately 6.5 million shares of GPIAC common stock at $10.00 per share to World Kitchen's stockholders.  The cash component of the consideration is expected to be funded by a combination of the cash in GPIAC's trust account established in connection with its initial public offering, the issuance of 5 million shares of GPIAC common stock to an affiliate of GP Investments, Ltd. and the proceeds of $275 million in new debt being provided by Citigroup and BMO Capital Markets.   After giving effect to the transaction and certain assumptions, GP Investments, Ltd. through its affiliated entities will become the largest single stockholder with approximately 28% pro forma ownership on a fully-diluted basis and former World Kitchen stockholders will have approximately 20% pro forma ownership. World Kitchen is expected to have an estimated $43 million cash balance to fund future growth post-transaction.  World Kitchen will have projected post-transaction net operating leverage of 3.0x expected adjusted 2016 EBITDA. The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is subject to approval of GPIAC shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.  The transaction is expected to close in July 2016. Citigroup served as GPIAC’s capital markets advisor, UBS served as GPIAC’s financial advisor, and Duff & Phelps served as financial advisor to the Special Transaction Committee of the Board of GPIAC.   Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as legal advisor to GPIAC.  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as financial advisor, and Latham & Watkins LLP and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP served as legal advisors to World Kitchen. Conference Call and Investor Presentation GPIAC will hold a conference call to discuss the transaction today at 10:00 a.m. ET. The conference call can be accessed by dialing 855-327-6837 (domestic), or 631-891-4304 (international), and asking to join the GP Investments Acquisition Corp. conference call.

    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $100,000 and $86,321 in advances
    made to us by our sponsor as described in this prospectus. These loans and  
    advances will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering    
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering    
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be    
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.                             

(3) Deferred underwriting commissions and other fees equal to an aggregate of   
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering will be placed into the trust   
    account at the closing of this offering. Upon completion of our initial     
    business combination, $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’        
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the             
    underwriters. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to 
    pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses    
    with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness        
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the   
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will  
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting        
    discounts and commissions.                                                  

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, approximately $150,000,000 (or approximately $172,500,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $5,250,000
(or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions and other fees, will be placed in a New
York, New York based trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $30,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year.
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, if any, the
proceeds from this offering will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business combination or (b) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete our business combination. If our initial business combination is paid
for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the
trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our
business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.

However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.
 
We will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned us $100,000 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest
bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015 or the
closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the
open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to
engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for
any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make
any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such
purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules,
the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that
such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
then only in connection with those of our ordinary shares that such shareholder
properly elected to redeem, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.
   
Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, some of these competitors may possess 
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to 
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial 
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the 
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in 
connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may 
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and 
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, 
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these 
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating 
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands
exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to


 throughout this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any
potential business combination target.

We will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and
operating expertise of our management that will be led by Mr. Fersen Lambranho,
our Chairman, and Mr. Antonio Bonchristiano, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer). Mr.
Lambranho and Mr. Bonchristiano have combined experience in the private equity
industry of close to 40 years and have served on the board of over 50 companies
in 15 different industry sectors, which we believe will benefit our ability to
identify and acquire a target business. While we may pursue an acquisition
opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to initially focus on
those industries and sectors where our management team has had direct investing
experience, such as consumer goods and services, retail and hospitality.

Our sponsor, GPIC, Ltd., is a wholly owned subsidiary of GP Investments, Ltd.
GPIC, Ltd. is the vehicle through which GP Investments invests its proprietary
capital in the funds it manages, directly or indirectly.

GP Investments is a leader in alternative investments in Latin America having
affiliates with offices in Bermuda, São Paulo, New York, London and Zurich,
currently managing more than $4.0 billion of assets as of September 30, 2014 on
a consolidated basis (i.e., including assets managed by BRZ Investimentos and GP
Advisors) with a focus on private equity, real estate and infrastructure,
successfully investing third-party and proprietary capital for more than 20
years.

As a way to spread its valuable investment experience in other emerging markets,
GP Investments has set up GP Advisors, which searches for private equity
opportunities mostly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. GP Advisors has a team
of 5 investment professionals, based in Switzerland, managing one listed
investment vehicle.

GP Investment has also expanded into adjacent asset classes, based on its
success in investing in real estate and infrastructure related companies over
the past two decades. In real estate, GP Investments has seven professionals
managing a development fund with 23 assets in the portfolio. In infrastructure,
GP Investments is continuing its consistent approach to investments within its
“buy-and-improve” strategy. The firm currently has six investment professionals
fully dedicated to infrastructure and is in the process of raising its inaugural
infrastructure fund.

Mr. Fersen Lambranho and Mr. Antonio Bonchristiano have alternated serving as 
Chairman and serving as CEO of GP Investments since 2003, when they and the 
senior management team acquired control of the firm from its founders. GP 
Investments currently has three active buyout funds in different phases of the 
investment cycle, managed by a team of 14 investment professionals. While GP 
Investments’ investment strategy is to focus on businesses that are based in 
emerging markets, with a focus on Brazil, the members of our management team 
have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around 
the world. This network of high profile international investors with whom we 
have partnered over the years has grown through the activities of our management
team in sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, their reputation for 
integrity and fair dealing with sellers, financing sources and management teams 
and their experience in executing transactions under varying economic and 
financial market conditions. This global network has provided our management 
team with a flow of referrals that has resulted in numerous transactions which 
were proprietary or where limited parties were involved in the sale process. 

GP Investments has built a solid track record of creating value for investors
through an active management strategy, usually ensured by the acquisition of
controlling stakes in the companies and assets in which it invests. GP
Investments has invested more than $5.0 billion from investors worldwide in 53
companies across 15 different sectors, with 45 divestments or partial exits
completed. While GP Investments is actively managing existing investments, all
but one of its existing funds are outside of their respective investment periods
and are not currently making new investments.

GP Investments’ extensive experience in finding attractive deals from private
and public sources and its leading capital markets position provides unique
insight when sourcing new investment opportunities and creating value. The
management team’s experience and proximity to real-time information position our
sponsor to obtain differentiated deal flow, frequently in a non-competitive
manner.

With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management team
is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business
combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable
candidate for our initial business combination. In addition, our management team
is currently involved in other businesses and is not required to devote any
specific minimum amount of time to our business, which may result in a conflict
of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a
business combination and their other businesses.
