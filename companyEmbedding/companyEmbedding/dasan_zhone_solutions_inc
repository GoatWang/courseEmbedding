Northwestel Deploys MXK Aggregation Platforms from DASAN Zhone Solutions to Improve Internet and Voice Services for Residents of Northern Canada

OAKLAND, Calif., July 18, 2017 /CNW/ -- DASAN Zhone Solutions (NASDAQ: DZSI), a global leader in network access solutions, announced that Northwestel, the leading telecommunications service provider in Northern Canada, has deployed MXK platforms from DASAN Zhone Solutions (DZS) to improve Internet access in remote communities and simplify delivery of lifeline voice services. �
"Access to high-speed Internet services makes a big difference in the lives of our customers and the community. Better Internet services will allow people to access remote healthcare, education and new job opportunities," said Zoran Vehovar, vice-president of network and IT for Northwestel. "When we started the process to select an access platform, we wanted to ensure that we could also support future broadband service over the same platform. This is especially important for us as we mainly deploy in rural areas and small towns where we need to capitalize on a multi-service access device that is cost effective. On all these fronts, the DASAN Zhone Solutions MXK was our choice," added Vehovar. 
"Service providers around the globe use MXK platforms from DASAN Zhone Solutions to deliver voice and data services to communities in remote areas," said Michael Fischer, vice president of sales for DASAN Zhone Solutions. "With the new aggregation platforms, Northwestel can support thousands of users and has a scalable network for future services and bandwidth needs." 
DZS' intelligent terabit access platforms can support thousands of subscribers and support both PON and Active Ethernet technologies. Northwestel uses the following aggregation platforms to deliver Internet access throughout Northern Canada: 

The MXK-319 supports up to 7,168 end users and holds seven line cards in one chassis.
More robust and bigger in size than the MXK-319, the MXK-819 supports up to 18,432 users and holds 18 line cards. 
The MXP-160 has a compact platform and provides next generation features and streamlines delivery of triple play services throughout the service area. The platform allows Northwestel to offer compelling bundles of multi-line voice, high-speed Internet access and multi-st IP video (including HDTV) over the existing copper infrastructure. 


To date, DZS has deployed enough MXK platforms worldwide to support more than 45 million total potential subscribers.

Nasdaq Hearings Panel Grants DASAN Zhone Solutions Request To Remain Listed On The Nasdaq Stock Market, Subject To Certain Conditions
Jun 8 17
DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. announced that on June 7, 2017, the company received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel) has granted the company's request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market provided that, on or before September 27, 2017, the company shall have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (Form 10-K) and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 (Form 10-Q). In addition, the Panel decision requires that the company be able to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq and that the company provide prompt notification of any significant events that occur during the extension period (including any event that may call into question the company's historical financial information or that may impact the company's ability to maintain compliance with any Nasdaq listing requirement or deadline for the filing of the Form 10-K and Form 10-Q). Previously, on April 6, 2017 and May 17, 2017, the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq notified the company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to its failure to timely file the Form 10-K and the Form 10- Q, respectively, and that the late filing of such reports served as an immediate basis for delisting unless the company timely requested a hearing before the Panel. The company timely requested a hearing and, on April 20, 2017, the company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Panel had granted the company's request to extend the stay of the suspension of trading in the company's common stock pending the company's scheduled hearing before the Panel on May 25, 2017 and a final determination regarding the company's listing status. The Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of its decision based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the company's securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted. In addition, any compliance document will be subject to review by the Panel, which may, in its discretion, request additional information before determining that the company has complied with the terms of the exception. In addition, the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council may review the Panel decision, in which event it may affirm, modify, reverse or remand the decision to the Panel. In the event the company is unable to fully comply with the terms of the Panel decision, the company's common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. The delisting of the company's common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and on the trading of its common stock.


DASAN Zhone Solutions Announces Receipt Of Additional Staff Determination Letter
May 18 17
DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. announced that on May 17, 2017, it received notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (Staff) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) stating the company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (Rule), due to its failure to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and that this filing delinquency serves as an additional basis for delisting the company’s securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market that will be considered by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (Panel) at the company’s scheduled hearing before the Panel on May 25, 2017. Previously, on April 6, 2017, the Staff notified the company that it did not comply with Nasdaq’s filing requirements set forth in the Rule because it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The letter also stated that, because the company failed to satisfy Nasdaq’s filing requirement within the past year, the company was not eligible to submit a plan to regain compliance with the filing requirement for Nasdaq’s review, and instead that the late filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K would serve as an immediate basis for delisting unless the company timely requested a hearing before the Panel. The company timely requested a hearing and, as part of that request, requested that a stay of the suspension of trading in the company’s common stock be granted. On April 20, 2017, the company received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that the Panel had granted the company’s request to extend the stay of the suspension of trading in the company’s common stock pending the company’s scheduled hearing on May 25, 2017 and a final determination regarding the company’s listing status. At the hearing before the Panel, the company will present its plan to evidence compliance with Nasdaq’s filing requirement with respect to both the delinquent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The company is diligently working to evidence compliance with Nasdaq’s filing requirement as soon as possible; however, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the company’s request for continued listing and a further stay of suspension. The delisting of the company’s common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and on the trading of its common stock.
