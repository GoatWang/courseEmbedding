PCT, LLC, A Caladrius Company, to Manufacture EU-Compliant Cell Therapy Product for IRX Therapeutics, Inc. From Its New Jersey Facility


September 8, 2015    				   	












PCT, LLC, A Caladrius Company (PCT), the manufacturing sciences and technical operations subsidiary of cell therapy leader Caladrius Biosciences (NASDAQ:CLBS) and leading external manufacturing partner to the cell therapy industry, announced today that it will expand its current manufacturing capacity at PCT’s Allendale, New Jersey facility to support IRX Therapeutics, Inc. (IRX)’s anticipated clinical trial manufacturing needs for the INSPIRE Phase 2b study in head and neck cancer patients. PCT will provide IRX with personnel and dedicated clean room capacity within its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) infrastructure and, subsequently, pursuant to European Union (EU) cell therapy manufacturing standards.
PCT has been providing manufacturing services since 2008 to support IRX’s development of IRX-2, a primary cell-derived biologic with multiple active cytokine components. IRX-2 is a cancer therapeutic designed by IRX to activate a patient’s immune system by unlocking the power of immunotherapy to restore immunity and overcome cancer-induced immune suppression. IRX-2 is in late-stage development in a neo-adjuvant regimen for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
The expanded arrangement includes IRX’s use of PCT’s ISO Class 6/Class 1,000 clean room system, enabling manufacture of cell-based products that can then be shipped to Europe and, when approved, commercially distributed on the EU market.
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with IRX to manufacture their cell therapy product to EU standards from one of our US locations. The versatility of our operations and our understanding of global regulatory processes provides cell therapy developers like IRX with a distinct advantage as they advance toward commercialization and render PCT the manufacturing partner of choice,” said Robert A. Preti, PhD, President of PCT, and Senior Vice President, Development and Technical Operations and Chief Technology Officer of Caladrius Biosciences.
“We are excited to both continue and expand our manufacturing partnership with PCT. With the critical support of PCT’s unique expertise and capabilities, we look forward to advancing the clinical and commercial development for our important and promising IRX-2 clinical development program,” said Jeffrey Hwang, President and COO, IRX Therapeutics.
About IRX Therapeutics

IRX Therapeutics was founded by John W. Hadden, M.D., a pioneer in the field of Immunopharmacology. The company’s product platform under development, which is based on over 30 years of research by Dr. Hadden, seeks to restore the immune system of cancer patients, which is suppressed by the onset of the disease. http://www.irxtherapeutics.com/

Supporting the developing immune response

 



Science of IRX-2 › Regimen
Regimen: IRX-2 is given with other medications believed to support the immune response
IRX-2 is not given alone. Instead, it is given as part of regimens containing additional pharmacologic agents that can support the promotion of an anticancer immune response. One regimen (the IRX-2 Neoadjuvant Regimen) is given before curative surgery, and another (the IRX-2 Booster Regimen) is given after surgery.
The components of each regimen are the same, except for differences in administration timing and location, as well as treatment duration.
The additional components of the IRX-2 regimen are low-dose cyclophosphamide, indomethacin, zinc-containing multivitamins, and omeprazole. Like IRX-2, these additional medications are not part of the standard treatment given to patients with cancer. However, it is believed they may be beneficial in supporting IRX-2 in the promotion of an anticancer immune response and in minimizing possible side effects of other components of the regimen.


Additional Pharmacologic Components in the IRX‑2 Regimens




Component
Dosage

Revolutionizing cancer treatment with immunotherapy

 


Power of Immunotherapy
Immunosuppression and Cancer


 



Immunity & Cancer
Power of immunotherapy: an increasingly important strategy against cancer
The idea that tumors could be recognized and rejected by the immune system was initially proposed in the late 19th century upon the observation that rare spontaneous tumor regressions occurred following infections, which may result in general activation of the immune system.1
More recently, preclinical studies revealed that tumors express immunogenic antigens and that these antigens induce immune responses that are able to protect against subsequent tumor challenges.2 Patients with melanoma were demonstrated to have T cells with specific activity against melanoma cells, and these cells were shown to be able to cause cancer regression when stimulated outside the body and returned to the patient.3-5
Over the last few years it has been recognized that the immune system in many patients has the ability to respond to cancer, but is usually prevented from doing so by immune defenses present in cancer cells. Many researchers and companies are studying a variety of means to overcome these defenses and activate the immune system more powerfully against cancer cells. Proof of concept for cancer immunotherapeutics has been established with recent drug approvals for various immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic melanoma and certain forms of lung cancer.


 



Cancer defenses limit the effectiveness of the natural immune response
The current model of cancer immunology is that tumor cells are antigenic (capable of being recognized by the immune system) but are insufficiently immunogenic due to multiple tumor-induced mechanisms of immune suppression that prevent the development of meaningful immune responses.
Cancer immunotherapy is based on restoring the ability of the immune system to be activated and attack the tumor.
Immunosuppression is known to be present in patients with SCCHN, who are consistently found to have disordered immune function at the time of presentation. Although they have normal B-cell function, immunoglobulin levels, and complement systems, SCCHN patients have immunological deficiencies of T-cell anergy and defective monocyte/macrophage function.6,7
The cumulative result of the various immune defects and immunosuppressive mechanisms in SCCHN is8:

The tumor successfully subverts the antigen presentation component (ie, dendritic cells) and the responding T-cell component of immunization, even though the tumor displays and sheds antigens capable of inducing immunization and tumor rejection
The compromised cellular immune response is, therefore, incapable of inducing tumor rejection

SCCHN: squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

IRX Therapeutics
IRX Therapeutics: a clinical-stage company developing novel immunotherapies
IRX Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company developing novel immunotherapies focused on reducing the immune suppression that is seen in the cancer tumor microenvironment, restoring immune function, and activating a coordinated immune response against the tumor. The lead candidate, IRX-2, is a proprietary therapeutic containing numerous active cytokine components. Data collected to date indicates that IRX-2 acts to restore and activate multiple immune cell types, including T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to recognize and destroy tumors. Currently, IRX-2 is being studied in an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed stage II, III, and IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) (INSPIRE) (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02609386) and in preoperative early stage breast cancer (ESBC) (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02950259).

Unlocking the power of immunotherapy

 



IRX Therapeutics is a clinical-stage bioresearch company developing IRX-2, an important new immunotherapy candidate for cancer
IRX Therapeutics is a clinical-stage company developing novel immunotherapies focused on reducing the immune suppression that is seen in the cancer tumor microenvironment, restoring immune function, and activating a coordinated immune response against the tumor. The lead candidate, IRX-2, is a proprietary therapeutic containing numerous active cytokine components. Data collected to date indicates that IRX-2 acts to restore and activate a coordinated immune response against the tumor. IRX-2 is a proprietary therapeutic containing numerous active cytokine components, which restores and activates multiple immune cell types, including T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to recognize and destroy tumors. Currently, IRX-2 is being studied in an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed stage II, III, and IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) (INSPIRE) (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02609386) and in preoperative early stage breast cancer (ESBC) (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02950259).

Seeking solutions in SCCHN

 


Unmet Need
Predominant Treatment
Potential Role of IRX-2


 



SCCHN
Unmet Need in SCCHN
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor in the head and neck. More than 90% of SCCHNs originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx. The estimated worldwide incidence of SCCHN in 2012 was approximately 686,000, with approximately 375,000 deaths.1 Oral cavity cancer in particular is a significant and growing problem in many parts of the world, with an estimated annual incidence of around 275,000.2


 



Predominant treatment: surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation
For patients with surgically resectable SCCHN (stages II, III, and IVA), the standard of care is curative surgery followed by adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence.3-5 Five-year survival rates are approximately 50%, and successfully treated patients may still have to cope with consequences of their treatment that affect appearance, function, and quality of life.6
Despite improvements in therapy, recurrent disease remains frequent and is generally treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biological therapy, or a combination of these modalities.7 The prognosis in recurrent or metastatic disease is poor, with median survival less than 1 year.7
Clearly, better therapies in the first-line setting are needed.


 



Potential role of IRX-2: reduce postsurgical recurrence in SCCHN
IRX-2 is in clinical investigation to determine whether neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with IRX-2 in newly diagnosed SCCHN beginning before curative surgery can reduce the risk of recurrence.
IRX believes that by shifting the balance back to immunosurveillance, by overcoming cancer-induced immune suppression and restoring immune function, IRX-2 therapy can help activate an effective anticancer immune response against the tumor. This response may lead to reduced recurrence and increased survival through immune memory.
SCCHN: squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
