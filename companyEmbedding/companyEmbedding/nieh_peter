"What entrepreneurs do is truly amazing - all the ingenuity and energy they apply to get their startup off the ground and then hit escape velocity.  Being their partner to help in any way I can is a special privilege."


Peter is a Partner of Lightspeed, and covers software, mobile and cleantech. He has been working in the venture capital industry since 1995. Peter has been recognized on the Forbes Midas List of top venture capital investors.
Peter’s current investments include 99Bill, BloomReach, Five Stars, MyBuys, and QuantumScape. He was also responsible for several investments which have had successful exits including Blue Nile (NILE), Celequest (acquired by Cognos), DoubleClick (acquired by Google, post IPO), Extensity (acquired by Infor, post IPO), Informatica (INFA), Kiva Software (acquired by Netscape), Phone.com (OPWV), PSS System (acquired by IBM) and TimesTen (acquired by Oracle).
Prior to Lightspeed, Peter worked in business development and product marketing at General Magic, a startup that before the emergence of the Web, pioneered the development of e-commerce and electronic media services by partnering with the world’s largest telecommunications service providers and consumer electronics companies.
He also managed Acer’s portable PC business in North America, where he launched the company’s first laptop PCs. Before Acer, Peter was a strategy consultant at Bain & Company and worked predominately with high-technology clients on product, sales and distribution strategies. While an undergraduate at Stanford University, he worked at Apple Computer, where he helped to develop the power management system for Apple’s first portable computer.
Peter holds a BS in Electrical Engineering, an AB in Economics from Stanford University and an MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

    A urologist is a physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the male reproductive system, as well as the urinary tracts of both males and females.


    These doctors cover the kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder, adrenal glands, urethra, and the male reproductive organs which include the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis. Some common disorders that urologists treat are urinary tract infections (UTI), stress incontinence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, kidney stones, erectile dysfunction, kidney cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and cystitis. These urological specialists also perform vasectomies and vasectomy reversals.
