	Who We Are
















































Skip To Content













Who We Are














HighTower is a national advisor-owned financial services company serving high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients from our headquarters in Chicago and corporate centers in New York and San Francisco as well as branch offices nationwide. Our advisors are experienced investment professionals with large and established advisory practices.
By reinventing how advisors on the front lines of wealth management can best serve and protect investors, HighTower has created a financial services business model in a ground-breaking class all its own.
Unlike integrated brokerage firms designed to build and distribute financial products – which drives profitability for the firm, but not necessarily returns for the clients – HighTower puts financial advice at the center of its business model.
Open Source and Employee-Owned
HighTower’s unique open source model means the entire financial services industry competes for our clients’ business. The HighTower tool chest includes resources, research and technology. And as an employee-owned firm, HighTower team members have an equity stake in the firm and a vested say in how the business evolves.
HighTower’s autonomy, combined with our access to Wall Street sophistication, truly sets us apart.
                    








Our Advisors









Fully supported by an industry-leading infrastructure and never beholden to sales quotas, HighTower advisors have proven track records and the shared goal of putting clients first. We are extremely selective when considering new advisors. Each candidate undergoes a rigorous advisor-acceptance process.

The Beginnings


Ups & Downs

 


Motivated by a need for fairer pricing, 24 traders who regularly gather under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street form the precursor to the New York Stock Exchange.


1819 – 1837 – 1857
Bank failures cause economic crises in the U.S.
 
 
1873 – 1896
In the U.S., 18,000 businesses, including hundreds of banks, go bankrupt; ten states also declare bankruptcy.
 
 
1882
Charles  Dow and Edward Jones founded a financial publication  to bring unbiased analysis to a broad audience and an index for measuring market strength and direction.

 
 
 
 



Close








Checks & Balances


Financial  Stewardship

 


1933 – The Glass Steagall Act
Limits activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms, post-1929 crash.


1940 – The Investment Company Act & The Investment Advisers  Act
Establishes regulations for those charged with investing on behalf of clients – requiring them to protect investors from fraud or misrepresentation.


 
 
 
 



Close








Access for You & Me


Deregulation

 


1950s
The introduction of mutual funds, revolutionized access to professionally  managed portfolio investing.


1975 - Deregulation of the stock brokerage industry
Deregulation of the stock brokerage industry by the U.S. Congress opened the door to discount brokers and substantially lower transaction costs.
  
1975 – The End of Fixed Stock Commissions
The SEC mandates the deregulation of the brokerage industry, eliminating high fixed fees and allowing market competition to dictate commissions.
  
1976 – First Index Mutual Fund
Individual investors gain access to the mutual funds market; by eliminating sales commissions, costs of mutual funds decrease.
  
1980s - Online trading for individual investors
Online trading for individual investors crept into being as early-users of personal computers looked for ways to leverage the new technology.

 
 
 
 



Close








Crisis Strikes


HighTower

 


1999 – Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The 1933 Glass Steagall Act is repealed, ending legal separation of commercial and investment banks. This repeal is later cited as a major contributor to the late-2000s financial crisis.
  
2007
The global financial crisis begins; the sub-prime debacle crushes the stock market over the next two years.


2007
In the midst of the financial crisis, HighTower, the nation’s first advisor -owned financial services firm, is founded; the company’s allegiance to the client/advisor fiduciary standard  - and the legal obligations that underscore it – sets HighTower up for success.
  
2012
HighTower ranks #13 on the Inc. magazine 500|5000 list of the fastest growing private companies in America which honors the company for its 8,853% growth over 3 years.

Consensus Ratings for Donaldson Company (NYSE:DCI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $47.00 (1.24% downside)
