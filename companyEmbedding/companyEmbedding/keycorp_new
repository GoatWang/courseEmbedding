KeyCorp. (KEY): New Analyst Report from Zacks Equity Research - Zacks Equity Research Report


December 10, 2013, 07:00:01 AM EDT
By Zacks Investment Research, Zacks.com

Summary:


KeyCorp's third-quarter 2014 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus
Estimate. Weak revenue generation resulted in the poor quarterly
performance. However, prudent expense management along with a fall
in provisions slightly salvaged the results. The company's
restructuring initiatives are expected to further strengthen its
credit quality and liquidity position going forward. Moreover, the
company's robust capital position, enhancement in asset quality and
steady capital deployment activities continue to boost investors'
confidence. Also, sustained growth in loan and deposits will likely
ease the pressure triggered by a persistent low interest rate
environment, elevated competition and stringent regulations to some
extent.


Overview:
Cleveland-based KeyCorp, a bank-oriented financial services
company, provides a wide range of products and services, such as
commercial and retail banking, commercial leasing, investment
management, consumer finance as well as investment banking products
to individual, corporate and institutional clients throughout the
U.S. and, for certain businesses, internationally.
The company operates through the following business
segments:
Key Community Bank serves consumers and small to mid-sized
businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment as well as
lending and wealth management products and services. These products
and services are provided through a 12-state branch network
organized into 9 internally defined geographic regions: Oregon and
Alaska, Washington, Rocky Mountains, Indiana, Western Ohio and
Michigan, Eastern Ohio, Eastern New York, New England, and Western
New York.
Key Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment
bank, focused largely on serving the needs of middle market clients
in six industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial,
public sector and real estate. The segment offers a wide-range of
products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and
equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance,
commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange,
financial advisory and public finance.
Other Segments consists of Corporate Treasury, Principal
Investing and a diverse range of exit portfolios.
In addition to the customary banking services, KeyCorp's bank ,
its registered investment advisor, and its trust company
subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services, personal
financial services, access to mutual funds, cash management
services, investment banking and capital markets products as well
as international banking services. KeyCorp also provides other
financial services, both within and beyond its primary banking
markets, through non-bank subsidiaries. These services include
accident, health and credit-life insurance on loans, principal
investing, community development financing, securities underwriting
and brokerage as well as other financial services. The company is
also an equity participant in a joint venture with Key Merchant
Services LCC.
In 2008, the company acquired U.S.B. Holding Co. Inc., the
holding company for Orangeburg, N.Y.-based Union State Bank,
expanding KeyCorp's presence in Hudson Valley markets.
In 2012, KeyCorp acquired 37 retail banking branches in Buffalo
and Rochester, N.Y. from First Niagara Financial Group by paying a
4.4% premium on deposits or nearly $95 million.
In 2013, KeyCorp divested Victory Capital Management and its
broker dealer affiliate, Victory Capital Advisers. The company
realized a net after tax gain of $92 million from the deal.
In Sep 2014, KeyCorp completed the acquisition of Pacific Crest
Securities, Portland, OR-based technology-focused investment bank
and capital markets firm. The financial terms of the agreement were
not disclosed.
As of Sep 30, 2014, KeyCorp had a network of 997 full-service
retail banking branches and about 1,290 ATMs. Further, the company
had total assets of $89.8 billion, total earning assets of $78.3
billion, total deposits of $68.5 billion and total equity of $10.5
billion, as of the same date.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations  Introduction  This section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. Some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. The page locations of specific sections and notes that we refer to are presented in the Table of Contents.  References to our "2016 Form 10-K" refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which has been filed with the SEC and is available on its website (www.sec.gov) and on our website (www.key.com/ir).  Terminology  Throughout this discussion, references to "Key," "we," "our," "us," and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. "KeyCorp" refers solely to the parent holding company, and "KeyBank" refers to KeyCorp's subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association.  Throughout the following discussion, industry-specific terms are used as defined below:   We use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and Austin. The education lending business and Austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009.   Our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. These portfolios, which are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. These exit loan portfolios are included in Other Segments.   We engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our Key Corporate Bank segment. These activities encompass a variety of products and services. Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients' financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients' needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates).   For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or BHC's total risk-based capital must qualify as Tier 1 capital. Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. As described under the heading "Regulatory capital requirements - Capital planning and stress testing" in the section entitled "Supervision and Regulation" that begins on page 8 of our 2016 Form 10-K, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all BHCs with assets of at least $50 billion, including KeyCorp. As part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluate a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Common Equity Tier 1, under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The "Capital" section of this report under the heading "Capital adequacy" provides more information on total capital, Tier 1 capital, and the Regulatory Capital Rules, including Common Equity Tier 1, and describes how these measures are calculated.  Additionally, a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in Note 1 ("Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies").  Table of Contents  Forward-looking statements  From time to time, we have made or will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results may differ materially from those set forth in our forward-looking statements. There is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those described in forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:   deterioration of commercial real estate market fundamentals;   defaults by our loan counterparties or clients;   adverse changes in credit quality trends;   declining asset prices;   our concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans;   the extensive and increasing regulation of the U.S. financial services industry;   operational or risk management failures by us or critical third parties;   changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations;   breaches of security or failures of our technology systems due to technological or other factors and cybersecurity threats;   negative outcomes from claims or litigation;   the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, conflicts, or terrorist attacks, or other adverse external events;   evolving capital and liquidity standards under applicable regulatory rules;   unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including but not limited to, changes in our access to or the cost of funding, and our ability to secure alternative funding sources;   downgrades in our credit ratings or those of KeyBank;   a reversal of the U.S. economic recovery due to financial, political, or other shocks;   our ability to anticipate interest rate changes and manage interest rate risk;   deterioration of economic conditions in the geographic regions where we operate;   the soundness of other financial institutions;   tax reform and other changes in tax laws;   our ability to attract and retain talented executives and employees and to manage our reputational risks;   our ability to timely and effectively implement our strategic initiatives;   increased competitive pressure due to industry consolidation;   our ability to adapt our products and services to industry standards and consumer preferences;   unanticipated adverse effects of strategic partnerships or acquisitions and dispositions of assets or businesses;   our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the First Niagara merger; and   our ability to develop and effectively use the quantitative models we rely upon in our business planning.  Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances.

Economic Overview  The U.S. economy started 2017 on a sour note with annualized GDP growth in the first quarter 2017 coming in at a mere .7%. Much of the deceleration in the first quarter of 2017 can be attributed to a slowdown in personal consumption expenditures in addition to drawbacks in private inventory investment and state and local government spending. However, these were partially offset by increases in exports and fixed investment. GDP growth in 2016 was slower than in 2015, due to a weaker start, with tepid growth of .8% in the first quarter of 2016 and 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016 before accelerating in the third quarter of 2016 to 3.5% and 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Consumer spending and inventory investment were major contributors. Slower growth in emerging markets, weak investment spending, and sluggish demand for American exports caused by a strong U.S. dollar, all factored in to the muted economic expansion in 2016. The IMF estimates that global GDP is set to expand 2.9% in 2017. The global recovery, however, appears to be uneven as developed countries are leading most of this year's upswing in global growth, with robust domestic demand buttressing growth in the Euro area and the United States.  Oil prices remain relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, after plummeting to multiyear lows in 2014 and 2015. Although inventories remain elevated, recent declines may help clear the way for stronger appreciation in 2017 and help support America's struggling energy industry. The stock market performed admirably in the first quarter, with the S&P 500 equity index up 5.5% since the end of 2016. A general rally has occurred following the November elections, and based on expectations for growth-friendly economic policies from the new U.S. presidential administration.  533,000 new jobs were added in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2017. This was up from fourth quarter of 2016, which saw gains of 443,000. However bad weather, accelerated hiring at the beginning of the year, and a late Easter all depressed payrolls in March, when employment increased by 98,000 jobs, which was well below consensus. Payrolls in January 2017 and February 2017 were revised down as well. Still, the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% on December 31, 2016, to 4.5% in March 2017, while the participation was unchanged at 63%. Slack appears to be leaving the labor market as reflected in rising wage growth, up 2.7% in March 2017, over last year. Accordingly, consumers prefer to spend rather than save, with personal consumption up 4.8% year over year, while the savings rate fell from 6.0% to 5.6%. Headline inflation was up by 2.4% year over year in March 2017, surpassing the Federal Reserve's target of 2.0%, although it fell slightly month over month, down .3%. Core inflation was also healthy year over year, at 2.0%.  Thanks to the solid economy and persistently low rates, the housing market generally benefited in the first quarter of 2017. New home sales growth was up 12.9% compared to the first quarter of 2016, while existing home sales were up 5.0%. Prices are also up, with average new home prices up 5.6% from year ago levels, and existing home prices up 5.3%. Housing starts also posted respectable gains in the first quarter of 2017, up 8.2%, from the first quarter of 2016. These gains were supported by multi-family construction, up 12.8%; while single-family construction was up 6.0%.  As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the target range for the fed funds rate by 25 basis points to .75% to 1.00% in March 2017. Policymakers reiterated that the risks to the economic outlook remained fairly balanced. Forward guidance was unchanged, with their statement noting that economic conditions will likely continue in a manner that will warrant gradual rate hikes. Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes also suggested that a reduction of their balance sheet may be on the agenda later this year. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 2.5% at the end of the first quarter of 2017, virtually unchanged from the prior quarter.  Long-term financial targets  Our long-term financial targets are as follows:   Generate positive operating leverage and a cash efficiency ratio of less than 60%;   Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio in the range of .40% to .60%; and   Achieve a return on tangible common equity ratio in the range of 13% to 15%.  Table of Contents  Figure 2 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial targets for the three months ended March 31, 2017.   Figure 2. Evaluation of Our Long-Term Targets Key Metrics (a) 1Q17 Targets Positive operating Cash efficiency ratio (b) 65.8 % leverage Cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related 60.4 % < 60 % charges (b) Moderate Risk Net loan charge-offs to average loans .27 % .40 - .60 % Profile Return on average tangible common equity (c) 10.98 % Financial Returns Return on average tangible common equity 12.87 % 13.00-15.00 % excluding merger related charges (c)  (a) Calculated from continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.

(c) Non-GAAP measure: see Figure 6 entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for reconciliation.  Strategic developments  Our actions and results during the first three months of 2017 supported our corporate strategy described in the "Introduction" section under the "Corporate strategy" heading on page 35 of our 2016 Form 10-K.   We continue to focus on growing our businesses and remain committed to improving productivity and efficiency. During the first three months of 2017, we generated positive operating leverage compared to the prior year, as revenue relative to the year-ago period benefited from higher net interest income, positive momentum in our fee-based businesses, and the addition of over one million newly acquired consumer and business clients. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased by $56 million, related to improved capital markets conditions and activity from the year-ago period. Trust and investment services income, cards and payments income, and service charges on deposits accounts also contributed to the growth, largely resulting from the First Niagara acquisition.   Net loan charge-offs increased during the first three months of 2017 compared to the year-ago quarter due to loan growth and credit quality migration in our commercial loan portfolio. Our net loan charge-offs were .27% of average loans for the first three months of 2017, below our targeted range.   Capital management remains a priority for 2017. As previously reported, share repurchases of up to $350 million were included in the 2016 capital plan, which is effective through the second quarter of 2017. We completed $160 million of Common Share repurchases, including $107 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market and $53 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs in the first quarter of 2017 under this authorization.   Consistent with our 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.085 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. An additional potential increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend, up to $.095 per share, will be considered by the Board for the second quarter of 2017, consistent with the 2016 capital plan.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit and investment, lending, credit card, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. Key Community Bank offers personal property and casualty insurance, such as home, auto, renters, watercraft, and umbrella policies. Key Community Bank also purchases motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts relating to new or used automobiles and light and medium-duty trucks via a network of dealers who regularly originate these third party installment sales contracts. These products and services are provided primarily through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 15-state branch network, which is organized into ten internally defined geographic regions: Washington, Oregon/Alaska, Rocky Mountains, Indiana/Northwest Ohio/Michigan, Central/Southwest Ohio, East Ohio/Western Pennsylvania, Atlantic, Western New York, Eastern New York and New England. In addition, some of these product capabilities are delivered by Key Corporate Bank to clients of Key Community Bank.  Key Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. Key Corporate Bank delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt  Table of Contents  and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. Key Corporate Bank is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. Key Corporate Bank delivers many of its product capabilities to clients of Key Community Bank.  Further information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments is included in this report in Note 19 ("Line of Business Results").  Supervision and regulation  The following discussion provides a summary of recent regulatory developments and should be read in conjunction with the disclosure included in our 2016 Form 10-K under the heading "Supervision and Regulation" in Item 1. Business and under the heading "II. Compliance Risk" in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Regulatory capital requirement  In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period ending on December 31, 2018 ("Regulatory Capital Rules"). Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp), establish a minimum Tier 1 Common Equity Capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to address procyclicality concerns and absorb losses during periods of financial stress, and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to . . .

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

CLEVELAND, Jan. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KeyCorp (NYSE:    KEY) announced today that it has provided notice of its intention to redeem all outstanding shares of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (NYSE:   KEY.H) (the "Preferred Stock") on February 15, 2017.








There are 14 million shares of Preferred Stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $350 million, currently outstanding. The Preferred Stock, issued in connection with KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. to replace First Niagara's preferred stock, will be redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $25 per share. Since the redemption date for the Preferred Stock is also a dividend payment date, the redemption price of $25 per share does not include any declared and unpaid dividends. Declared dividends of $.539063 per share, which were declared by the Board of Directors today, for the full current quarterly dividend period from and including November 15, 2016 to but excluding February 15, 2017 will be paid separately in the customary manner on February 15, 2017 to holders of record on February 3, 2017. All shares of the Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company ("DTC") and will be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC. Upon redemption, the Preferred Stock will no longer be outstanding and all rights with respect to such stock will cease and terminate, except the right to payment of the redemption price. Also upon redemption, the Preferred Stock will be delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Computershare, KeyCorp's transfer agent, will serve as the redemption agent.  Computershare is located at 250 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021.

BUFFALO, N.Y., May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KeyCorp (NYSE:    KEY) today held its annual meeting in Buffalo, NY, where it highlighted a successful and transformational year for the nearly 200-year-old institution in 2016.  Shareholders heard how Key is growing across the company, the success of the First Niagara merger, and the continued commitment to creating shareholder value. 








"Key's successful acquisition of First Niagara, the largest in our company's history, and the addition of one million new clients is certainly a headline for 2016. But just as important is that Key delivered on our commitments to grow and create momentum for 2017," said Beth Mooney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp.  
Mooney reflected on KeyCorp's history in New York, while also highlighting Key's strong levels of client growth:   "Key was founded in New York nearly 200 years ago. Meeting with our shareholders in Buffalo today has given us the opportunity to acknowledge the transformational impact of the First Niagara acquisition as well as our success across the organization in 2016. Outside of the acquisition, Key's Community Bank grew net retail households by more than 45,000 and the Corporate Bank added or expanded over 1,200 relationships. This growth will enable us to continue helping our clients and our communities thrive for many more years to come."
During the annual meeting, shareholders elected 16 nominees to KeyCorp's Board of Directors, each with executive leadership experience within a variety of national and international organizations, across a number of industries. Board elections were one of five proposals put before shareholders at the company's annual meeting, held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY. 
Other proposals presented and approved by shareholders included the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the company's independent auditor for the 2017 fiscal year, an advisory proposal on compensation of KeyCorp's named executive officers, and an advisory proposal on the frequency of the shareholder vote on KeyCorp's executive compensation. A shareholder proposal which requested the Board seek an independent Board Chairman was presented but not approved by the shareholders.
