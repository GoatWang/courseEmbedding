2008-09-25 00:27
















































 





    DALIAN, China, Sept. 25 /Xinhua-PRNewswire/ -- Energroup Holdings Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: ENHD), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries known as "Chuming," a Dalian-based processor and supplier of fresh and prepared meat products in China, today announced the appointment of Mr. Yizhao "Philips" Zhang as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer.  Consequently, Chuming also announced the departure of Ms. Wang Shu, who tendered her resignation as Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective on September 18, 2008.  Ms. Wang will assume role of Corporate Controller for the Company.      "As we look to capitalize on the growing opportunities in consumer goods and in the meat products industry, we view this as an ideal time to strengthen our management team with individuals who bring experience that will be of particular value to Chuming," Mr. Shi Huashan, Chairman and CEO of Chuming, commented.  "We believe that Philips’ extensive experience in corporate and financial management will bring the level of expertise needed to successfully lead us to the next stage of our development, and be extremely valuable as Chuming executes on its business strategies and enhances its relationships within the capital markets," Shi concluded.     Mr. Zhang has over 13 years of experience in corporate finance, accounting, financial advisory and portfolio investment.  From April 2006 through May 2008, he served an interim position as the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of China Natural Resources, Inc., a NASDAQ-listed company, and then became Chief Financial Officer of another publicly listed company, Shengtai Pharmaceutical, Inc.  From April 2005 through April 2006, he was the vice president and senior manager of Chinawe Asset Management Consultancy Limited, a publicly listed company which managed non-performing loan assets in China. Mr. Zhang also worked as a portfolio manager and foreign exchange and common stock trader with the South Financial Service Corporation from 1993-1999.    Mr. Zhang is a Certified Public Accountant certified by the Delaware State Board of Accountancy.  He is also a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  He graduated with a Bachelor of Economic Science from Fudan University in 1992.  He then participated in a Master of Science Program at Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), l’Universite de Montreal in Montreal, Canada.  In 2003 he obtained an MBA degree with financial analysis and accounting concentrations from the State University of New York at Buffalo.
