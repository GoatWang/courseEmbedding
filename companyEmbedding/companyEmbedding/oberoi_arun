          Red Hat Appoints Arun Oberoi as Executive Vice President, Global Sales and Services
        

          May 24, 2012
        



 RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source

      solutions, today announced the appointment of enterprise software

      industry veteran Arun Oberoi as executive vice president of global sales

      and services. Oberoi brings strong go-to-market executive experience —

      including global leadership roles with HP and IBM — to Red Hat, where he

      will further develop the company's sales and services strategy.

    


      "As Red Hat continues to make strategic investments in our business and

      move into new markets, having seamless integration between sales and

      services and our technology vision is critical," said Jim Whitehurst,

      president and CEO, Red Hat. "With his outstanding track record of

      success and his global sales, services and management experience, I am

      very confident in Arun's ability to help Red Hat capitalize on our

      opportunities as we meet our customers' evolving technology and business

      needs."

    


      Oberoi has led and repeatedly built rapidly-scaling businesses across a

      wide spectrum of companies ranging from start-ups and mid-sized

      companies to multi-billion dollar global organizations. Oberoi comes to

      Red Hat from Viridity Software, a data center infrastructure management

      start-up, where he served as president and CEO, doubling new customers

      every consecutive quarter in 2011, and seeing the company's flagship

      product through its recent acquisition by Schneider Electric. Prior to

      Viridity, Oberoi was CEO of Aveksa, a leading access governance and

      management software start-up, where he led the company to fast growth

      and a financing round for further expansion.

    


      In his earlier roles, Oberoi was responsible for leading worldwide

      sales, services and marketing organizations with a strong focus on

      cultivating partner ecosystems as a core element of customer value

      delivery and synergistic market reach. He was executive vice president

      of worldwide sales and services at Micromuse, a market-leading provider

      of network and service management solutions. Micromuse was acquired by

      IBM, where Oberoi led the integration and its continued fast growth and

      field expansion as vice president within IBM Tivoli.

    


      Before that, Oberoi had an accomplished career at HP, where he held

      various executive leadership roles, including vice president and general

      manager of worldwide top 100 corporate accounts and industries, as well

      as vice president and general manager of worldwide sales and marketing

      for HP's software business. As part of HP's software business, he led

      the development of a dedicated worldwide sales and marketing

      organization for the portfolio, which included HP's OpenView Management

      software, driving sales growth from initial stages to $1 billion in

      revenues.

    


      Oberoi earned his Master of Business Administration from Northwestern

      University's Kellogg School of Management. He also has a Master of

      Business Administration from Panjab University Business School in

      Chandigarh, India, and a Bachelor of Arts, with honors, from India's

      Delhi University.
