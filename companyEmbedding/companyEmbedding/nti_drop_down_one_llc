CST Brands & CrossAmerica Announce Dropdown Transactions and 
      Acquisition of One Stop Stores





Dropdown to CrossAmerica of 29 “New to Industry” stores and 12.5 
        percent interest in CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel supply business


CrossAmerica agrees to acquire One Stop network of stores in 
        West Virginia


Transactions to close in the third quarter of 2015







June 15, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN ANTONIO & ALLENTOWN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CST Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CST) (“CST Brands”) and CrossAmerica Partners LP 
      (NYSE:CAPL) (“CrossAmerica” or “The Partnership”) announced today two 
      dropdown transactions totaling approximately $261.5 million between CST 
      Brands and CrossAmerica. The transactions are expected to close in the 
      third quarter of 2015.
    


      In addition, CrossAmerica has entered into a definitive agreement to 
      acquire the One Stop convenience store network, based in Charleston, 
      West Virginia, that is also expected to close in the third quarter of 
      2015.
    

      “This is the second dropdown transaction between CST and CrossAmerica 
      and the first to include our New to Industry stores,” said Kim Lubel, 
      Chairman and CEO of CST Brands. “In the nine short months since we 
      acquired the general partner of CrossAmerica, the Partnership has 
      executed over one half billion dollars of acquisitions and dropdowns.”
    

Dropdown of “New To Industry” Stores and Fuel Supply


      CST Brands has agreed to sell to CrossAmerica the real property 
      associated with 29 recently constructed “New to Industry” (“NTI”) stores 
      for an aggregate consideration of approximately $135.5 million. The NTI 
      stores are larger formatted stores that accommodate broader merchandise 
      categories and food offerings and have more fuel dispensers than CST 
      Brands’ legacy stores. CrossAmerica will lease the acquired real 
      property to CST Brands at a “triple net” lease rate of 7.5% for a ten 
      year initial term, which will renew automatically at predetermined lease 
      rate increases.
    

      CrossAmerica has also agreed to acquire an additional 12.5% limited 
      partner interests in CST Fuel Supply LP (CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel 
      supply business) for total consideration of approximately $126.0 
      million. CST Fuel Supply LP (and its subsidiaries) provides fuel to 
      substantially all of CST’s U.S. company operated convenience stores and 
      largely maintains the fuel supply agreements between CST and its fuel 
      suppliers. CST Fuel Supply LP distributed approximately 1.9 billion 
      gallons of fuel in 2014, and is expected to earn a net profit margin of 
      approximately 5 cents per gallon of wholesale motor fuel distributed.
    

      The aggregate consideration of approximately $261.5 million will consist 
      of $142.0 million in cash and approximately $119.5 million or 3.6 
      million newly issued common units representing limited partner interests 
      in CrossAmerica.
    

      The independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST 
      Brands and the independent conflicts committee of the board of directors 
      of the general partner of CrossAmerica have, as applicable, approved the 
      terms of the dropdowns of the 29 NTI stores and 12.5% interest in CST 
      Fuel Supply from CST Brands to CrossAmerica.
    

      The conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner 
      was advised by Evercore Partners as its independent financial advisor 
      and Richards, Layton & Finger as its independent legal counsel. Paul 
      Hastings acted as legal counsel to CST Brands.
    

Acquisition of One Stop Network of Stores


      CrossAmerica has agreed to purchase the 41 company-operated One Stop 
      convenience store network (“One Stop”) based in Charleston, West 
      Virginia, along with 4 commission agent sites, 9 dealer fuel supply 
      agreements and one freestanding franchised quick service restaurant.
    

      Of the 45 company-operated and commission agent sites, 30 are owned fee 
      simple locations. Five of the company-operated locations have quick 
      service restaurants. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 
      2014, the aggregate 54 sites sold approximately 36 million gallons of 
      motor fuel primarily under the Marathon and Exxon fuel brands, and had 
      approximately $40.5 million in inside sales.
    

      "We are delighted to acquire the One Stop portfolio,” said CEO Joe 
      Topper. "Michael Graney, President of One Stop, has built a regional 
      powerhouse organization with a strong basis for future growth. This 
      acquisition further solidifies Cross America’s commitment to West 
      Virginia and Virginia," Joe added.
    

      "We are excited to join the CrossAmerica Team and look forward to a 
      bright future for our valued and loyal employees and customers and the 
      communities we serve," said Michael Graney, President of One Stop.
    

      The NTI and fuel drop downs and the One Stop convenience store network 
      acquisition are subject to customary conditions to closing, including 
      financing, and are expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.

CST Brands Plans Second Dropdown to CrossAmerica
Forty new-to-industry stores will be transitioned this summer.

May 8, 2015, 04:36 pm
By Brian Berk, Convenience Store News 


 



SAN ANTONIO  — CST Brands Inc. will drop down approximately 40 new-to-industry (NTI) stores to CrossAmerica Partners LP this summer, CST Chairman and CEO Kim Lubel ​confirmed Friday during a joint 2015 first-quarter earnings call for both companies. These dropdowns will be stores that have been built since CST was spun off from former parent company Valero Energy Corp. in May 2013. 
A price associated with the deal has not yet been determined, according to Lubel. Along with passing ownership of the real estate of these stores to CrossAmerica, CST will hand over the wholesale fuel supply contracts. However, the parent of Corner Store convenience stores will continue to operate these stores.
CST purchased 100 percent of the membership interests of the general partner and 100 percent of the outstanding incentive distribution rights of Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica, a master limited partnership (MLP), effective Oct 1.
This summer's transaction will mark the second dropdown CST has made to CrossAmerica this year. In January, it closed on the sale of a 5-percent limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply to CrossAmerica in exchange for common units representing an approximate 6.1-percent limited partner interest in CrossAmerica.
STRATEGY FOR CONTINUED GROWTH
As it drops down stores, CST will continue to build NTI stores and seek acquisitions. The company plans to build 35 to 40 new Corner Store locations in the United States in 2015, along with 10 to 12 Dépanneur Du Coin convenience stores in Canada.
On the merger and acquisition front, Lubel said the market remains “fragmented.” There are more potential sellers and acquirers than in the past, but plenty of opportunities still exist.
“We think we are a very attractive buyer,” she said. “We know how to run core stores and have done so for decades.”

CST is looking for acquisitions in areas of strong economic conditions, and a solid network in terms of stores. One potential region CST is looking at for growth is the upper Midwest, Lubel revealed, adding that CrossAmerica’s purchase of Erickson Oil Products Inc., which included 64 c-stores, has been very successful thus far.
CST EARNINGS RISE
CST saw overall net earnings rise by $3 million for its latest quarter ended March 31, to $14 million.
“Led by a strong U.S. fuel margin along with continued growth in same-store merchandise sales, both in the U.S. and Canada, we delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015,” said Lubel. “The momentum in inside-store traffic has positioned us well for the upcoming summer driving season.”
Looking at U.S. retail operations more in-depth, total operating income rose $18 million year over year to $42 million. Fuel margins increased 4 cents per gallon year over year to 14 cents per gallon, which Lubel noted was especially impressive considering the first quarter is seasonally weaker in this category.
Merchandise gross profits rose $5 million to $97 million, with same-store sales increasing 3 percent — the fourth consecutive quarter in terms of growth in this area.
On a core per-store basis, CST’s U.S. retail division sold 4,966 gallons of fuel per site per day. In terms of dollars, motor fuel sales were $10,967 per site per day. Inside the store, merchandise sales per site per day came in at $3,488, an increase of $267 per site per day.
NTI stores led the way in in-store merchandise sales. CST also cited fountain drinks as an area of excellent growth, which often leads to purchases of other high-margin in-store merchandise items. CST believes this growth can continue as it recently installed 160 Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain machines in the Southwest.
As for its current fiscal second quarter, CST provided initial guidance that U.S. gallons sold per store per day will be in the range of 5,100-5,200. Merchandise sales per store per day are expected to be in the $3,950-$4,050 range, with merchandise gross margins ranging between 29.5 percent and 30.5 percent.
The San Antonio-based retailer operated 1,035 c-stores as of March 31.
CROSSAMERICA INCREASES PROFITS
Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica’s companywide earnings totaled $35 million in its most recent quarter ended March 31, compared to $16.7 million during the same quarter in 2014.
Its retail division, primarily consisting of its Erickson Oil and Petroleum Marketers Inc. acquisitions, sold 46.1 million gallons of fuel at a gross margin of 10.2 cents per gallon, vs. 15.3 million gallons at a 2.1-cent margin in the first quarter of 2014.
CrossAmerica’s in-store merchandise gross margins totaled $7.8 million in its most recent quarter. The MLP did not have these retail operations in the first quarter of 2014.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
