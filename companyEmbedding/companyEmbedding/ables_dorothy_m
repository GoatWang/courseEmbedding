Key Skills, Attributes and Qualifications:

Ms. Ables brings a depth of experience in the transportation aspects of our industry, having served in positions of leadership with Spectra Energy Corp and its predecessor companies for over 30 years, as well as extensive financial expertise to our Board. The Board considered Ms. Ables' extensive experience in the pipeline, processing and midstream business as adding value to our stockholders at a time in our business when transportation is crucial to our strategy. Ms. Ables' financial expertise acquired through serving as Chief Financial Officer of Duke Energy Gas Transmission and later as Vice President of Audit Services of both Spectra Energy Corp and Duke Energy was also a key attribute leading to her appointment. Most recently, Ms. Ables has gained executive experience as the Chief Administrative Officer of Spectra Energy Corp, from 2008 until her February 2017 retirement effective upon Spectra's merger with Enbridge Inc. While serving in that role, Ms. Ables had responsibility for human resources, information technology, community relations and support services. Ms. Ables has prior governance experience gained from service on the Board of Directors for Spectra Energy's publicly traded master limited partnership, Spectra Energy Partners, LP, and is very active in community and charitable endeavors, including serving on the Board of Trustees of United Way of Greater Houston from 2008 to April 2016. This diversity of background and leadership experience makes her a valuable addition to our Board and to the Audit and Compensation Committees of our Board.
