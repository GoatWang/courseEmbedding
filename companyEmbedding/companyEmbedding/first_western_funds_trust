It really is different here.




Investment Management







Your investment portfolio is about much more than your account balance. It’s about fulfilling your goals for each dimension of your wealth.
At First Western Trust, we understand that investments are important tools that help you reach these larger goals. In order to meet these objectives, you need a team of experts that not only understands the technical aspects of investment management but also takes the time to learn about what matters most to you.
First Western’s investment services employ sophisticated planning strategies and institutional-quality investments to customize a portfolio that’s connected to your story and optimally serves your needs.
Our team develops a relationship with you to understand your goals as well as your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs. This allows us to tailor an investment portfolio based on a long-term investment management philosophy and an understanding of risk that’s rare in this business.



Assessing Risk
At First Western Trust, we understand that risk is about more than market volatility. You have to also consider such factors as permanent impairment of capital, liquidity, and inflation. Guided by your goals and our risk-aware approach, our experts tailor your personalized investment management plan to get you where you want to go.



Centralized Approach
As a client of First Western, you benefit from the knowledge of our entire team, not just one individual. First Western’s centralized approach to investment management includes the investment planning expertise of your Portfolio Manager, our Investment Research Team, as well as our Investment Policy Committee when putting together your portfolio



Putting It Together
Based on your financial goals and aspirations, our Portfolio Managers create a customized investment policy statement that reflects your risk tolerance, yield and liquidity goals. This policy serves as our roadmap to optimize our investment services to your investment goals for today and into the future.

thought leaders.

Trust Investment Management Services

Our Investment Service Resources
In today’s global economy, investors have access to a great number of financial products, and it can feel overwhelming. We simplify these complexities by identifying exceptional investment managers vetted by our research team and Investment Policy Committee. The result is a carefully selected menu of equities, bonds, real assets, private equity, absolute return, and exclusive investment opportunities that are not available to retail investors.
Using this menu, our Portfolio Managers tailor our investment management services to your needs. Because we serve as a fiduciary, we do not take any commissions on products within your portfolio. This ensures that you have the best thinking of our firm, free from conflict of interest.
Throughout the year, we keep you updated on your portfolio and the market through regular in-person meetings and investment services resources like our week in review and quarterly economic updates.



    Visit Our Market Commentary Page for More Information
  



Investment Policy Committee
The Investment Policy Committee (IPC) consists of four leading individuals from across the organization. Led by First Western’s CIO, Debra Silversmith, and guided by the belief that optimized diversification* leads to better long-term, risk-adjusted returns, the IPC oversees all facets of our investment management services. This includes asset and sub-asset class selection, appropriate allocation between assets classes,* and investment manager selection, monitoring, and ongoing due-diligence. In addition, the IPC meets regularly to discuss all pertinent financial and economic developments to determine any strategic or tactical changes necessary for client portfolios. The Portfolio Managers then use these resources and apply them to the investment planning process, delivering a diversified portfolio, tailored to your goals.



Whether you are setting up a personal investment portfolio, trust investment management services, or an endowment for your nonprofit, our team is available to help. Discover how our holistic approach to investment services can help your reach your goals by filling out the form below or calling 303.531.8100.

 




Investment and insurance products and services are not a deposit, are not FDIC- insured, are not insured by any federal government agency, are not guaranteed by the bank and may go down in value.
*Neither asset allocation, nor diversification guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. They are methods used to help manage investment risk.

Community







Being socially responsible is not an obligation, it is part of who we are. Since we opened our doors in 2004, we have invested more than $19 million in the form of donations, sponsorships, community development loans, and affordable housing investments to organizations and projects that are making a lasting difference in our communities.
First Western Trust’s associates are involved with a number of nonprofits in our communities, donating their time to local organizations by serving on boards and advisory committees, as well as through direct volunteering.
 



FW Gives
In an effort to ensure our resources provide the most benefit, we conducted a materiality survey to understand the needs and interests of all of our stakeholders: our community members, associates, shareholders, and clients. With this input, we built our corporate social responsibility program and focused on three philanthropic pillars that our stakeholders felt were most relevant to our business and the community at large. Our three pillars are:
 



Economic Development through Entrepreneurship
We recognize that the best way to help our communities prosper is to support the growth of a successful workforce and local businesses. By partnering with organizations dedicated to helping individuals build skills for the workplace and by fostering entrepreneurship, we help our communities grow stronger.



The Arts
Art awakens creativity and fresh responses to thinking, feeling, and seeing. It can serve as an outlet and as inspiration. Unfortunately, in many communities, art education and access is extremely limited. We support organizations that help both local artists and also introduce children and adults to a broader cultural experience as a way to inspire new ideas and new ways of thinking.



Women & Girls
Studies have shown that when communities put money and time into women and girls, they achieve a multiplier effect with those women reinvesting in the community that helped support them. Even in our local cities, we see disparate gender statistics that need change. By working with organizations dedicated to self-sufficiency and education for women and girls, we seek to make a positive impact on our communities.



FW Gives Programs
FW Connects Day
Our associates believe in giving back to the communities where we work and live. In 2014, we instituted our first-ever FW Connects Day, an annual event that brings together First Western associates to participate in a day of community service. Each of our teams participates in a project, working together, to support one of our three philanthropic pillars: Economic Development, The Arts, and Women & Girls. In 2016, our associates gave over 500 hours of their time to community service projects during FW Connects. We look forward to seeing the impact we have in 2017.
#WealthIsAbout Grants Contest
At First Western Trust, we understand that wealth is about so much more than money. It’s about making an impact on your community and leaving a positive legacy for generations to come. To help support our communities, we launched the #WealthIsAbout grants contest in 2016. Through the grants contest, we give $7,000 to one organization in each of our markets that supports The Arts, Economic Development, or Women & Girls as voted on by the community. Learn more about our #WealthIsAbout grants contest and our philosophy of wealth.
Community Connections Committee
Each of our local teams is deeply involved in the communities in which we live and work, and at our Denver headquarters, we have a volunteer committee that organizes monthly charity events to foster greater community involvement. Through volunteer events, such as cooking and clean-up projects, as well as charity drives and contests, the Community Connections Committee is committed to helping our teams find meaningful opportunities to give back throughout the year.

TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE
 All Deposit Accounts
 FDIC deposit insurance is now $250,000 per depositor
IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT THE EXPIRATION OF UNLIMITED COVERAGE FOR NONINTEREST-BEARING TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS
By operation of federal law, beginning January 1, 2013, funds deposited in a noninterest-bearing transaction account (including an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account) no longer will receive unlimited deposit insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Beginning January 1, 2013, all of a depositor’s accounts at an insured depository institution, including all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount ($250,000), for each deposit insurance ownership category.
For more information about FDIC insurance coverage of transaction accounts, visit www.fdic.gov.
By clicking the above link you will be directed to another site outside of First Western Trust. First Western Trust provided this link for your convenience, but assumes no responsibility for the content, links, privacy policy, or security policy of the aforementioned website.
 
NOTICE TO ALL COMMERCIAL CLIENTS
Federal law requires that Commercial/Business clients be provided with this notice.
Certain federal and/or state laws such as the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act or Third Party Service Providers’ Rules may limit or prohibit certain transactions such as (but not limited to) those coded as unlawful Internet gambling transactions.
First Western Trust Bank (“The Bank”) may decline to accept, process or pay any transaction that we believe to be illegal or unenforceable (regarding your obligation to pay us or otherwise) under applicable law; or which is otherwise limited or prohibited, including but not limited to any transaction involving or relating to any unlawful Internet gambling or illegal activity.
These restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful internet gambling.
 
SECURITY STATEMENT
Security and Encryption
Our online banking system brings together a combination of industry approved security technologies and recommended customer security procedures. We feature a password controlled system, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, VeriSign Digital ID, a router and firewall to regulate incoming and outgoing information to protect both your information and ours.
Browser
Security begins with your browser. Our SSL encryption has been certified as a 128-bit secure server. Only a web browser such as Netscape Navigator 4.7 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher will be supported. These browsers support 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption. This provides a secure channel for data transmission. When you connect to our server, all requests sent by you and responses from us are encrypted.
Authenticity
To begin a session, you will be asked for your Log-In ID and user password. We use a “three strikes and you’re out” philosophy to protect our customers. After three unsuccessful attempts, the system locks out the user until someone from the bank intervenes and verifies the customer and password. Digital ID verifies the user’s identity and establishes a secure connection.
Data Transfer
Because of the security features of both the required browser and our SSL encrypted server, the connection is secure. Data traveling over the internet between the user and the bank is encrypted with the top industry standard, Secure Sockets (SSL) protocol.
Router and Firewall
All log-in requests are first filtered through a router and then through a firewall to determine whether the user is granted access to the requested destination and to protect the internal bank network from unauthorized outside access. The router is responsible for determining who has access to which parts of internet banking. The firewall is a higher level of security to further filter and verify access.

Deposit Insurance at First Western Bank
Bank deposits held in your accounts in the Trust Department are covered by FDIC insurance subject to coverage limits. FDIC insurance does not cover other financial products, such as: stocks, bond, mutual fund shares, life insurance policies, annuities or securities. The standard insurance amount is $250,000.
FDIC deposit insurance coverage is available up to $250,000 for the non-contingent, ascertainable interest of each beneficiary in an irrevocable trust and each plan participant in a directed employee benefit plan account, such as a 401(k). For revocable trust accounts, the limit is $250,000 per owner per beneficiary up to five beneficiaries (more coverage available with six or more beneficiaries subject to specific limitations and requirements). Certain retirement accounts (including IRAs, self-directed defined contribution plans) have a separate $250,000 per owner FDIC insurance coverage limit. This insurance coverage is separate from the coverage on your checking, savings, money market deposit and certificate of deposit accounts held at First Western Bank & Trust outside of your retirement or trust accounts. For more information on FDIC deposit insurance, go to www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits.

Pricing & Performance
Literature





Pricing & Performance

Literature










Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price and the deduction of all fund expenses. Returns based on NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Year-To-Date (YTD) returns are calculated from January 1st of the reporting year and not annualized.
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund's NAV.
The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV as of the date indicated. Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found on each fund's Overview page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section of each individual product page. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. Please go to the individual product pages for information relating to the composition of the quoted distribution rates. 
 
Effective June 1, 2017, the following Funds changed their security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV: Western Asset Income Fund and Western Asset Premier Bond Fund.  Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.


























The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Note that unlike other closed-end funds, Western Asset Middle Market Debt Fund, and Western Asset Middle Market Income Fund are not publicly traded and closed to new investors.
