Sven-Olof Lindblad
Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone and thank you, for joining us. I'm pleased to say that Lindblad Expeditions is off to a strong start in 2017, as the booking momentum we generated during the end of 2016 is accelerated into this year.
During our first quarter, reservations for future travel were record shattering, eclipsing the same period in 2015 by 31% and 2016 by 86%. And this strength was very much broad based with significant growth across virtually every one of our destinations. Increasingly, not only are we seeing increased booking activity for travel in the current year, but we are also generating significantly more demand for itineraries in 2018. The timing of marketing material versus the year ago certainly plays into this, but it's clear that the overall interest in our expanding offerings continue to grow and the increase demand further bolsters our confidence in our long-term growth plan.
2017 is significant for us; symbolically, we’re celebrating the 50th anniversary of my father's ground breaking expeditions to the Galápagos Islands, which followed last year's 50th anniversary of his historic first passenger expedition to Antarctica. These milestones remind us all of the heritage of the expedition travel, and Lindblad in particular, a deeply rooted heritage that blends geography, knowledge and a laser focus on providing our guests with the most fulfilling experience as possible.
It is a combination of these factors that I believe are critical to the relationship and trust we have developed over decades with our myriad constitutions. There is a vast community of people in the United States and abroad who created the notion of experience as core ingredient of their lives. They are willing to invest significantly in these experiences, provided they believe a company has the ability and the commitment to fill their desires, we have always known that; however, it is more important now than ever before.

Everyone in this organization is fully cognizant of that salient fact and committed to ensuring we deliver on that promise for each and every one of our guests at every step along their journey; in their first engagement for the booking process and travel preparations during the actual expedition whether on board or off and once back at home. Our guests do not want to be passive tours and we foster active engagement with an experienced expedition team on vessels that are ideally equipped for exploration.
We also spend a significant amount of time and resources ensuring these vessels are rigorously maintained in accordance with applicable regulations, international conventions and insurance requirements. Despite these steps, there are times when unforeseen repairs become necessary, in some rare cases, voyages that have already been heavily booked need to the cancelled. This was the case with the Orion after the engine failure on December 27th in Antarctica.
An incident of this magnitude was unprecedented in our history as we have never had calls to cancel the entire season previously. But I am pleased to inform you that the Orion returned to service April 19th as planned and guests are currently enjoying it in itineraries. Unfortunately, this past quarter, we also had an issue with an air-conditioning system on the National Geographic Sea Lion, which results in cancelling two weeks in Central America.
These mechanical issues have of course affected our financial results, which Craig will cover in a moment. However, it is important to emphasize that these incidents, while unfortunate, were in no way symptomatic of any long term factors; not age of the vessels, not lack of proper maintenance, there were simply events that really but periodically can and will affect the vessel.
Looking ahead, we are little over a month away from the inaugural voyage of the U.S. built National Geographic Quest; the first installment, if you will, of our long term growth plan. She is essentially sold out for our last season and it's gratifying to see that our other ships operating in the area doing well despite the added inventory. It verifies our original thesis that adding to this geography was solidly rooted in excess demand. She will be the most sophisticated passenger vessel built in the U.S. in decades, and we are incredibly excited to launch our first entirely new purpose built expedition ship.
For sister ship, the National Geographic Venture is on track for delivery in Q2 of 2018, and we are very close of selecting a shipyard for our planned blue water vessel for delivery in Q3 2019. This will, I believe, be the most thought out and equipped global expedition ship in the world, enabling us to penetrate regions inaccessible before and great comfort within array of modern tools for enhancing the expeditions tours.
As we increase our capacity, we also continue to hone our human resources so that we can out skip upbeat as this growth kicks in. At the end of the day, it's not all about hardware but about the people in the field; captains, expedition leaders, chefs; naturalists, et cetera, who make these expeditions powerful and memorable; recruitment, training our development, are key to success. We have also significantly augmented our marketing and sales platform; adding fields' sales representative, broadening our communications tools and developing partnerships to generate audience interest.
We also continued to see great promise in Natural Habitat, which is providing -- proving to be a valuable acquisition. This is particularly true as it relates to cross selling, which has grown exponentially since May 2016. We will continue to look for opportunities to add companies or products with economics, brand fit and management ability come together. Along those lines, I’ve just returned from a two week expedition in the South Pacific with a writer, a film team and dive experts to help craft another series of expeditions for our guests.

This expedition will bring voyage to a seven month deployment of the National Geographic Orion beginning in March of 2018. What I saw the people I met the opportunities on earth will add greatly to a remarkable experience with intent to provide. Linblad Expeditions is [technical difficulty] Company with a dominant equity as our hardware; we are rather a mission driven enterprises whose value is our ability to connect our guests with the world in deep meaningful fairly research ways. The name Lindblad Expeditions is not meant to be taken that lightly nor is our partnership with National Geographic. We are not only offering expeditions but live and breathe in that faith on a daily basis, which ultimately provides the greatest value of all relevance.
And now, let me turn the call over to Craig to discuss our financial results in detail.
Craig Felenstein
Thanks Sven. As Sven mentioned, Lindblad has started 2017 with sustained operating momentum. Bookings continued to pace well ahead of a year ago, and given our average booking over approximately nine months, the strength we are seeing today should translate into substantial revenue growth in the back half of this year and beyond. This, combined with the significant demand for our first new build, the National Geographic Quest, continues to give us confidence in the long-term growth targets we have laid out.
There are some short-term hurdles that will impact the current year, which I will discuss in a moment. But the growing demand for expedition travel, combined with our expanding capacity and Lindblad’s distinguished track record in delivering unparalleled expedition experiences has us poised to deliver increasing shareholder value in the years ahead.
Turning the first quarter, on a reported basis, Lindblad delivered revenue growth of 3% versus the first quarter of 2016, while adjusted EBITDA declined by 42%. These results included contributions from Natural Habitat, which was acquired during the second quarter of 2016, as well as the impact of several voyage cancellations in the current year. Excluding these voyage cancellations, we estimate revenue growth would have been 17% and adjusted EBITDA would have declined approximately 800,000.
The Lindblad segment reported revenues of $53 million, $8 million below a year ago, due to lower ticker revenue from the previously discussed cancellation of four voyages on the National Geographic Orion to perform necessary engine repairs, as well as the unplanned cancellation of two voyages on the National Geographic Sea Lion to repair the air conditioning system. All of these voyages were highly booked at the time of cancellation, so the revenue loss was significant over $9 million, $11 million in ticket revenues offset by $1.9 million of insurance revenue to cover certain expenses.
Excluding the impact of these cancellations, we estimate Lindblad segment revenue growth would have been approximately 1% versus the first quarter a year ago. Available guest nights in the quarter declined 18%, primarily driven by the cancelled voyages, partially offset by the additional charter nights from the launch of our expeditions in Cuba.
Occupancy in the quarter was 87% versus 92% a year ago, primarily due to the booking headwinds we saw during the early part of 2016 that we have discussed previously. Despite these headwinds, net yield remained in line with the year ago at $1,008 per night, primarily due to the higher rates versus the first quarter a year ago. Given the high occupancy and price points of the cancelled voyages, they did negatively impact our metrics in the quarter. We estimate that occupancy would have been over 88% and net yield would have been approximately $1,060, if not for the cancellations.
Turning to the cost side of the business, Lindblad segment operating expenses were up 2%, primarily driven by $2.9 million increase in stock-based compensation, mainly associated with Sven’s distribution of his personal shares to the employee base. This was partially offset by accelerated depreciation a year ago due to the December retirement of the National Geographic Endeavour. For the full year of 2017, we anticipate approximately $5 million of additional stock-based compensation versus 2016 with the vast majority of this increase related to the CEO distribution.

Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, total operating expenses were 1% lower than the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to the decline in G&A expenses from lower employee cost, which were mostly offset by an increase in cost of tours. The increased cost to tours reflects the addition of expeditions in Cuba and unanticipated reimbursement costs to guest due to the cancellation of the Orion and Sea Lion voyages, partially offset by lower fuel cost.
Fuel cost in the quarter was 34% below prior year at 3.1% of revenue compared with 4.1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted net cruise cost on a per night basis increased 23%, but the majority of this increase reflected a decline in available guest nights due to the voyage cancellations.
Overall, on a report basis, the lower revenue due to the voyage cancellations resulted in adjusted EBITDA that was $7.7 million lower at the Lindblad segment versus the first quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of these voyage cancellations, we estimate adjusted EBITDA in the quarter would have approximately $16.3 million or 7% below the prior year, reflecting the lower occupancy.
Total Company net income in the quarter was $0.6 million or $0.01 per share as compared with $10.5 million or $0.23 per share in the first quarter of 2016. The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by the lower operating results and $2.9 million of higher stock-based compensations.
Turning to the balance sheet, we remain extremely well positioned to invest in future growth opportunities. We ended the quarter with $104 million in unrestricted cash. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $20.1 million, which included $17 million spent on the new builds and an additional $3 million spent on vessels repairs, that is expected to be reimbursed. Including only maintenance CapEx, free cash flow was a slight source in the first quarter.
Given the strength of our balance sheet, the confidence we have in our long-term growth opportunity and the belief that the Company’s share and warrant prices are not reflective of the value of the Company and our prospects, we repurchased 481,000 shares and 513,000 warrants for $5.5 million during the first quarter under our $35 million stock and warrant repurchase plan. As of May 1st, we have approximately $13 million remaining under the existing plan. It is important to note that our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our existing businesses and external growth opportunities that will enhance our long term growth profile.
Turning to the full year 2017, the Lindblad segment is currently pacing $12 million ahead of the same point a year ago, despite the voyage cancellations on the Orion and Sea Lion. And it is primarily due to the additional inventory from the anticipated launch of the National Geographic Quest in June and from the additional charter expeditions in Cuba. We are currently at 92% of our full year projected ticket revenues for 2017, which compares to 93% of the 2016 full year ticket revenue at the same time a year ago.
Factoring in the estimated $9.1 million in revenue and $6.5 million in adjusted EBITDA impacts from the six voyage cancellations; we now expect total Company tour revenue in 2017 between $275 million and $281 million; 14% to 16% growth versus 2016; and adjusted EBITDA between $47 million and $49 million or 12% to 17% growth versus 2016. The change versus our original guidance is due to the impact of the Sea Lion cancellations and some unanticipated costs related to the Orion cancellations. It is important to note that these impacts are short-term and we remain on track with the long term financial objectives that were led out when the Company went public in 2015.

Please note that current expectations are for the second quarter results and metrics to be down year-on-year, while bookings year-to-date in 2017 are up over 60% versus the prior year, given the long time experienced in most locations. We are still seeing the impact of some of the booking softness during the first half of 2016. We will also be impacted by the timing of voyages, which will defer some revenue until the third quarter that was previously recognized in the second quarter in 2016.
Looking at the back half of the year, Q3 and Q4 results will benefit from the strong bookings over the last nine months and the launch of the National Geographic Quest. Additionally, Natural Habitat had seasonality to the results with a significant portion of their revenue in the second half of the year and the majority of the annual adjusted EBITDA that will be recognized [technical difficulty].
Thanks for your time this morning. And now Sven, Ian and I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from [Steve Kozel] with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Any early read you can share with us on 2018 booking pace?
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Right now, we’re seeing some significant strength in 2018 out of the gate. It's actually ramped up rather quickly compared to 2016 at the same time for 2017. About 60% greater this year than it was the same time year ago. Interestingly enough, but 2018 pace is also significantly ahead of where it was in 2015 for 2016. At that point, we’re probably about 15% to 20% higher than that pace. So we are seeing some significant bookings already for 2018 and it speaks to not only this strength today, but also some of the weakness that we’re seeing a year ago at the same time.
Unidentified Analyst
And then in terms of customer origin, any kind of outbound markets that you’ve been seeing -- that you’re seeing that are particularly strong or weak?
Sven-Olof Lindblad
When you say, outbound origins, the majority of our guest only come to U.S. In terms of the markets that today are strong, it’s the market that traditionally we do really, really well and we’re seeing strength in Alaska, we’re seeing strength in [indiscernible], we’re seeing strength in the Galápagos. So we continue to see strength in those markets that our guests have been utilizing for us for very long time.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Greg Pendy with Sidoti. Please go ahead.
Greg Pendy
Just looking over to Natural Habitat, I know, I believe the second quarter last year, was that a partial close when you did roughly $6 million, or was that the full quarter, just trying to understand the seasonality of the business.
Sven-Olof Lindblad
The deal closed towards the end of May actually it was more towards the beginning of May. But yes, it was a partial quarter I think it was May 6th was the actual date. So, you're seeing a partial quarter in Q2 and then a full quarter in Q3 and Q4.
Greg Pendy
And then just as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit what type of cross selling, because I guess you didn’t have any revenues from March last year. But I mean what type of synergies you are seeing, are you seeing just from sharing, I guess, the database of clients?
Ian Rogers
So one of the things we know is the demographics of Nat Habs clientele and ours, are quite similar, also very much oriented to nature based travel. And so Nat Hab offering our products to their audience and vice versa has proven to be very effective. We’ve been testing in a variety of different ways to see how that could be most cost effective in terms of distributing these ideas across from our Company to Nat Hab and Nat Hab to us. But its growing month-by-month and we’re finding a lot of synergy in that area.

Operator
Our next question today comes from Greg [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Frederick Wightman
This is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. I know that you said that most of the delta in the guidance is due to the cancellation from the Sea Lion. But did you also say there were some unexpected costs from the Orion? Any sense for how big that was.
Craig Felenstein
When you look at the original expectation that we had heading into the year, the expectation was the Orion impact was going to be about $3 million. The overall voyage cancellation impact so far or I should say all-in for this year is about $6.5 million. The delta between those two things is pretty much split evenly between the Sea Lion and the Orion. The Sea Lion costs are significant from a cancellation perspective because the cancellation was only for two voyages and did not exceed the 30 day window that we typically have for our loss on higher reimbursement.
So the Sea Lion impact was partially because of that, it was partially because of additional costs that we utilized to take our guests down there that had already traveled down to where the Sea Lion was leaving from. And so that was the impact on the Sea Lion. The Orion impacts, there was additional costs that we decided to take on to take care of our guests from; cancelation costs that they had on air fare; cancellation cost that they had on the hotel side of things; there was also some charter costs that we had to take up that previously we were looking to get rid of. So there was some additional cost on the Orion side that certainly took place in the quarter. A lot of the costs related to both of these things, related to taking care of our guests that were into these because of these things and about spend mostly go little bit in terms of that the first that we took.
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Well, at the end of the day, what became paramount in terms of our priority was to make sure that every single individual who was inconvenienced, some were greatly inconvenienced, i.e. they’re already down there when it became apparent they could not continue their voyage. And so what we just wanted make sure was that we treated all those people as well as we possibly could in order to maintain long term relationships with them. And interestingly enough more than 75% of the people who were cancelled off the Orion and Antarctica within week, so we booked on another voyage.
And I think is a reflection of the fact that we took care of them very, very well, and some of the cost related so that certainly exceeded our expectations. And certainly the air lines that were not nearly as cooperative as one would have liked to the circumstance like this in terms of imposing cancellation penalties. But just to be clear, whenever and fortunately, it's extremely rare that we do have an incidence like this. It's critical for us to take very, very, very good care of our guests. In certain instances, we paid for them to stay down in Argentina for several days so that the transition back to the United States was as easy as possible. Certainly, weren’t obligated to do that technically but chose to do that as it relates to maintaining those relationships.
Frederick Wightman
So just on a related note, I mean, do you think that these cancellations are hurting the brand among your potential customers? Or do you think that that 75% of rebooking figure is a positive overall?
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Once again I’ve learned over the years is that if and when anything bad happens and you deal with people respectfully and with a notion that they are the priority, they become the most loyal clients you could possibly have. And I have every single time and there have been few incidences, but it could be something its weather related or whatever. Whatever it is, the inconveniences to guest if you take care of them well, they become your greatest advocates. And so I believe that these people will be talking to tons of other people about how they were treated in a bad circumstance and that will reflect well on the Company.

Frederick Wightman
And then I think toward to end you mentioned the cost in Cuba were little bit higher than you anticipated. Could you just talk about what the feedback from that market has been so far? Was that comment relative to your plan or just relative to the existing book of business previously?
Craig Felenstein
I'll let Sven talk about how Cuba is going. But in terms of the cost, the cost actually came in line with our expectations. They were just higher than last year, because we did not have the Cuba voyages a year ago. So when you look at things year-on-year, there is additional costs related to that. But the cost themselves came in very much in line with what expected this quarter.
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Well, I think that probably answered the question. To that answer, the question or is there an additional element that you’d like covered.
Frederick Wightman
Just broadly speaking, I mean any feedback from it is that are you still satisfied with what you're seeing in the market, anything that’s different than you expected?
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Well, I think in Cuba, almost everything is different and expected because when you walk into a country like that or develop an idea in a country like as new as circumstances are in a country like that, there are plenty of surprises. Fortunately, we have a very strong team on the ground that’s been actively engaged in monitoring every aspect of what's going on there, and able to adjust accordingly. It will take a while before Cuba is really stable from the perspective of reliability. That mean if you would compare it to let's say European context, it has and will continue to provide some surprises.
But the general appreciation of Cuba as a destination is high from the perspective of our audience understands the fact that not everything works like clockwork in this country. And they really I think appreciate access to an unusual program in this most interesting of countries.
Operator
Our next question today comes from George Kelly with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.
George Kelly
A couple of questions for you, first if I could start with the Quest; wondering if you could talk about how the pricing and booking patterns played out versus your initial expectations before you started selling it; and then if you could quantify expected revenue contribution from that shift this year?
Craig Felenstein
Look, I'll handle the second one first. We’re not going to into specifically individual revenue contribution for a specific vessel. When we did go public in 2015, we laid out that for the first year, because it was the half year, you were looking somewhere in that $13 million to $15 million of revenue for the vessel overall. So I'm not going to say much more than that, because that’s been out there in public domain, so we’re going to shy away from talking about individual vessel contributions. But, Ian, why don’t you talk about the booking patterns?
Ian Rogers
Quest has been extraordinarily well received in the market. We have experienced very strong bookings from the moment we announced the vessel and that pattern continues through to launch the end of June. And we’re excited it's a newest U.S. flagged vessel in anyone fleet built with very high standard, built in the U.S. And all of our travel partners were excited, as well as within the Company, around this. So bookings has been strong from all segments of our business.
George Kelly
And then second question on the growth metrics you provided about the first quarter in bookings, in which, it sounds like a very strong environment. That includes Natural Habitat, correct? And is there any way you could take Natural Habitat out of your booking numbers for this year's first quarter to compare them with last year.
Craig Felenstein

George, so when we talk about bookings, we talk about booking specific to the Lindblad segment, to the Lindblad fleet. So when we talk about 50% growth, positive, that and we’re seeing in the first quarter. That just relates to the Lindblad fleet and does not include Nat Hab. Interestingly, we certainly have more available inventory, we talked about the Quest and we talked about Cuba, but we did have the offsetting negative this time now associated with the Orion and Sea Lion. So the 60% plus booking trend that you’ve seen in first quarter, that Sven spoke about, is really just a indication of how strong things are looking forward to future travel. So we feel very optimistic about things once again pass these voyage cancellations that we have to deal within the first quarter.
George Kelly
And then last question on potential acquisitions. Can you talk about the pipeline, do you feel like there is some things that seem -- do you have a full pipeline? Are you happy where you’re at with potential acquisitions?
Craig Felenstein
I think when it comes to acquisition, the Company has from even before went public, has been very open and honest about the fact that we are open for business. We are always looking at new and I would say compatible ways to expand the business opportunity for us in the long term. We think we have a significant amount of growth still embedded in our existing fleet, especially with the additional inventory that we’re adding over the next three years. But like we did with Natural Habitat, we continue to look at a lot of opportunities at any given moment to expand that growth profile.
To be frank, we’re passing a lot of things; mostly because they don’t fit with the echoes of what we do or we don’t think its sustainable long term growth opportunity for the Company. The pipeline today, I would say, is normal, it's nice, robust compared to where it was a year ago and in order to complete it I think there’re several days that we’re looking at any given moment, both from a fleet perspective as well as from a differential perspective. And we’ll continue to explore those as they present themselves in most places.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Next question today comes from Monica [indiscernible] with Focus Capital. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
I just had one just to ask about the thinking behind your buyback, specifically the split between the share buybacks and the warrant buybacks. As I recall when you started buying back first few quarters, you brought just warrants. If you had specification of significant price appreciation in the stocks or warrants, buyback would seem to be better being for the book in terms of saving share dilution in the future. Wondering what's going to taking the opportunity through most of the buyback on the shares?
Craig Felenstein
Sure. So when we do our buyback, we actually look at the intrinsic value of the launch at every individual share price. So we compare the intrinsic value of one to the other and look at what the best value is at any given moment. Doesn’t mean that we will stop buying one versus the other, it means that we’re just going to take advantage of the bigger opportunity at any given moment. And that is why you’ve seen a little bit of shift from the warrants for the shares. We are still happy to buyback warrants if they present themselves at the right price. But we’re also going to compare that to what the share price is at any given time. And that’s how we take a look at it.
Unidentified Analyst
In Q1, how many warrants are in hands of the sponsors?
Craig Felenstein
I forget the exact number. I'll tell you, when we get back to you with that number after the call, okay?
Operator
And we are currently showing no further questions. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Craig Felenstein for any closing remarks.

Sven-Olof Lindblad

                                    Chief Executive Officer
                                


Sven-Olof Lindblad was born in Switzerland and traveled extensively with his father, renowned adventure-travel pioneer Lars-Eric Lindblad, who led some of the first non-scientific groups of travelers to Galápagos (1967), Antarctica (1966), and many other regions of the world.
For six years, Sven lived in East Africa photographing elephants and wildlife in Kenya and assisting filmmakers on a documentary about the destruction of African rain forests. His early exposure to nature and wildlife taught him the importance of maintaining natural resources and understanding the cultural background of remote regions of the world.
In 1979, Sven launched Special Expeditions (now Lindblad Expeditions), an innovative travel company offering marine-focused expeditions aboard small ships. Lindblad has built his company around a core tenet: to provide travelers the opportunity to discover for themselves the natural, cultural and historic regions of the world and to provide thoughtful approaches that make such travels enriching, responsible, safe, fun and memorable.
In 2004, Lindblad formed a multifaceted strategic alliance with National Geographic that combines the strengths of these two pioneers in global exploration with the goal of further inspiring the world through expedition travel. This mission, coupled with the company’s longstanding commitment to conservation, has positioned Lindblad Expeditions at the forefront of environmentally sensitive expedition travel and resulted in numerous travel and environmental awards.
In May 2006, Lindblad received international recognition for his distinctive and successful model of tourism in a ceremony hosted by HRH, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg at the Grand-Ducal Palace. He also had a newly discovered endemic species of moth in the Galápagos Islands, Undulambia lindbladi, named in honor of his conservation work in the archipelago. The United Nations Environment Programme also recognized Lindblad’s accomplishments, naming him to their Global 500 roll of honor.  
Lindblad is a member of the General Assembly of the Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Islands; serves on the Board of The Safina Center, on the National Geographic Council of Advisors, and on the Board of Trustees of RARE; was named commissioner of the Aspen Institute’s Commission on Arctic Climate Change in 2008, is a founding Ocean Elder of the non-profit organization, Ocean Elders, which brings together global leaders to pursue the protection of the ocean’s habitat and wildlife, and serves on the Board of Advisors for Pristine Seas.
An avid photographer, Lindblad’s photography has appeared in Smithsonian and National Geographic magazines, and he has produced photography books on Alaska, Baja California and Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park published by Rizzoli.

Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Lindblad Expeditions fourth quarter 2016 financial results conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today’s event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Craig Felenstein, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Craig Felenstein
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Lindblad’s 2016 fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Joining me today is Sven Lindblad, our Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Ian Rogers, our Chief Operating Officer.
Sven will begin with some opening comments and then I will follow with some details on our fourth quarter and full year results before we open up call up for Q&A. You can find our latest earnings release in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Before we get started, let me remind everyone that the company’s comments today may include statements about expectations for the future. Those expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company’s actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by these expectations.
The company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimates and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. If you’d like more information on the risks involved in the forward-looking statements, please see the company’s SEC filings.
In addition, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in the company’s earnings release.
And with that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Sven.
Sven-Olof Lindblad
Thanks, Craig. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk to you today about Lindblad Expeditions, and we would like to take a few minutes to discuss the company's performance in 2016 and some of the major events of the past year that shaped this financial result. I will then spend some time devoted to the path ahead and why I frankly have never felt more confident about the long-term prospects of the company.
As I believe most of you know, our reason to access public markets was to raise capital and a public currency so that we could capitalize on the growing opportunity we saw for the company to add capacity and make acquisitions to satisfy demand amongst our customers. We also discussed at the time that adding capacity in our industry has a lead time and until the capacity came online our growth opportunities and levers were frankly limited.
While 2016 was a year where we made significant progress in building our platform, our management team and opportunities set for the future but we fell short of our initial financial plan for a number of reasons, all of which we have discussed previously; concerns over terrorism following the Paris bombings and Brussels terrorist attack, the incessant drumbeat and concern over Zika, which began to diminish interest for a time in tropical areas that we trade, a delay in timing of some of our marketing materials versus previous years.
Interestingly given that our booking window is approximately nine months in duration these items had very little impact on the first half of 2016 as we delivered 5% revenue growth, but that was reflective of the booking strength we generated prior to November 2015. We saw a significant slowdown in bookings towards the end of 2015 and during the first four months of 2016 from these issues, which ultimately put pressure on the second half of the year.

We also had to cancel several voyages this past year, most notably on the Orion due to a significant engine malfunction. Nothing of this magnitude had ever happened in our company's history. In fact I can count on one hand the number of incidents that have required the cancellation of multiple voyages, and while there will be some short-term financial ramifications, Craig will cover this of course, we were able to mitigate the overall impact through insurance coverage and our marine team’s extremely efficient response, and it should enable the vessel to return to normal operations in April 2017 this year, just next month.
I think it is important to know that we went out of our way to meet the needs of any guests who were inconvenienced in any fashion and the end result was continued confidence in the ability to deliver on our guest experience. In fact, over 70% of the cancelled guests on the five voyages have already re-booked for future expeditions.
Despite all of the unique forces in 2016, occupancy this past year did remain over 90%, and we actually expanded our net yield slightly resisting as we always have a temptation of any meaningful discounting as a mechanism to buoy short-term results. We are fully committed to the long-term growth plans that you are all familiar with and will not erode our potential by engaging in these kinds of practices.
At the same time this past year we continued to strengthen the organization building both our infrastructure and human capital necessary to grow our business robustly and profitably in the long-term, including solidifying our core executive team with Craig Felenstein as our CFO, and Phil Auerbach as our CCO, Chief Commercial Officer.
We also took several strategic steps this past year that we believe will further solidify the long-term growth prospects of the company through the investment in new capacity, which will come online shortly and through closing an acquisition that is a great, great compliment to our existing business. We acquired Natural Habitat in May 2016 and frankly couldn’t be more pleased with this acquisition.
Natural Habitat has already provided significant benefits and we have only just begun to explore the opportunities that each organization can provide for each other. Nat Hab is fully dedicated to nature travel with a longstanding strategic alliance with the World Wildlife Fund. They have a price point similar to us. They provide an ability to offer land-based programs while keeping it in the family so to speak. They provide the ability to cross-sell our marine products to their audience. They can grow with access to capital they previously didn't have, and they have a solid management team that is able to operate effectively and autonomously without creating a distraction for our core team.
This was a highly strategic acquisition providing all of the above and meaningful diversification. And as I sit here today I am more confident than I have ever have been that we will exceed our expectations from when we closed just 11 months ago. As we go forward Nat Hab confirms our view that there are a number of highly accretive tuck in acquisition opportunities that could broaden our platform for our customer base, while growing and enhancing the economic opportunities of our company.
We will continue to explore these opportunities as we focus on maximizing the potential of our existing operations and adding capacity whenever we are confident we can do so at compelling rates of return. On that front, we launched the Endeavor II in December replacing the original Endeavor in the Galapagos. It was delivered on time and on budget. Bookings are strong and has been favorably adopted by traveling public and our industry partners.
The National Geographic Quest is on pace for delivery and for its maiden voyage on June 26. She is virtually sold out for the summer of 2017. This is the most ambitious passenger vessel built in the United States in decades and when I visited the Arctic a couple of weeks ago, I was soundly impressed by the quality of work, and I am very, very excited by what it will do for our guests’ experience. 

I'm actually quite proud that we were able to build this ship in the United States. We are on pace for the sister ship of the Quest, the Venture, which will enter service in the second quarter of 2018, and we are close to finalizing the shipyard for our blue water vessel scheduled for delivery in 2019. We know that our decades of experience in expedition cruising and our deep understanding of what matters to our clientele will make this the most exciting and innovative expedition ship in the world.
We also saw significant booking growth in 2016 following the softness in the beginning of the year. In fact, since April of 2016 bookings for 2017 and beyond have eclipsed the previous year each month with January and February beating 2016 sales by 70%. And as we are committed to robust growth we have also put focused effort on accelerating our capacity in marketing and sales. This includes doubling our field sales force, developing a variety of new partnerships, reinvigorating our digital platform and our efforts in [media].
There is no question that the story of Lindblad Expedition is worthy of public relations and we are making great strides in that arena. I don't know if any of you saw CBS, a couple of weeks ago, CBS morning and evening news but there were several stories that were broadcast from our ship, the National Geographic Explorer in the Antarctic.
Looking ahead we believe firmly that interest in the expedition category will only continue to expand. Given the complexity of both execution and the needs and wants of the expedition traveler there really is no substitute for experience in our 50 plus year history of expedition travel along with the value-added, long-standing partnership with National Geographic provides both the ability and the credibility we believe is unmatched.
We intend to harvest the expanded interest in this category generated and use it to our advantage. In summation, 2017 is off to an extremely good start in terms of sales, in terms of fleet development and in terms of preparedness to deliver solid, long-term results. We are committed to being open to and unearthing opportunities that are brand appropriate and that will augment the core plan and we are extremely confident that we will meet our long-term financial goals as we enhance our preeminent position as leader in the maritime expedition travel sector.
Let me now please let me turn the call over to Craig to walk through our 2016 performance and 2017 financial outlook. Thank you.
Craig Felenstein
Thanks, Sven. Lindblad’s sustained focus on our core mission of providing unparalleled guest experiences enabled the company to once again deliver high occupancy rates in 2016, while at the same time expanding our net yield to $976 per night despite the headwinds that were present earlier in the year. And while the full year and fourth quarter financial results reflect some of the booking softness from the first half of 2016, we finished the year with bookings ahead of 2016, including over 50% growth in December versus the same month a year ago.
On a reported basis, Lindblad delivered revenue growth for the full year of 15%, while adjusted EBITDA declined 11%. These results include contributions from Natural Habitat, which was acquired during the second quarter of 2016. The Lindblad segment reported a 1% revenue decline primarily from lower other revenue for items such as airfare offers and trip extensions.
Guest ticket revenues were flat year-on-year in the fourth quarter as increased rates were offset by slightly lower available guest nights, primarily due to the National [Geographic] planned repositioning during the third quarter which we talked about previously, as well as from the translation of two voyages during the year to perform necessary repairs.

Occupancy for the year remained over 90%, but declined slightly from 2015 primarily due to lower occupancy on the National Geographic Endeavour in anticipation of its retirement at the end of the year. Booking on its replacement, the National Geographic Endeavour II have been very strong and we expect to see significant growth in the Galapagos in 2017, the 50th anniversary of Sven’s father’s first expedition to this amazing location.
Full year adjusted EBITDA at the Lindblad segment declined by 17% primarily due to the lower revenue as well as a 4% increase in operating expenses. Adjusted net cruise costs on a per night basis increased 7% primarily due to higher personnel expenses and public company costs as we executed on our long-term growth plan. Cost of tours was also up slightly due to planned dry dock expenses and higher charter costs, most notably from the addition of charter expeditions in Cuba during December. This was partially offset by a 21% reduction in fuel costs versus the prior year. Fuel cost for the year were 3.4% of revenue compared with 4.3% in 2015. 
Turning now to the fourth quarter, on a reported basis, Lindblad delivered revenue growth of 21% or $10 million, while adjusted EBITDA declined $3 million. Excluding contributions from Natural Habitat, the Lindblad segment reported a 10% revenue decline primarily from lower occupancy in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned on our last call, this was anticipated due primarily to the retirement of the Endeavour as well as to booking headwinds that we talked about during the early part of 2016.
The revenue in the quarter was also impacted by approximately $1 million from the unplanned cancellation of a voyage on the National Geographic Orion due to a significant engine repair. As we indicated in our 8-K filing earlier this year, the engine repair will also impact the first quarter of 2017 as we cancelled four additional voyages in the Antarctica. While the majority of the guests on the canceled voyages, as Sven mentioned, have already rebooked with Lindblad for travel in 2017 or 2018, we do still anticipate a $9 million or $10 million impact to revenue in 2017 along with a $2 million to $3 million impact to EBITDA. The Orion is scheduled to resume normal operations in Europe in April of this year.
Net yield in the fourth quarter was down in large part due to the lower occupancy that we just discussed as well as from the impact of canceling the Orion’s Antarctic voyage in December, which typically garners higher yields. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA at the Lindblad segment declined by $6 million primarily due to the lower revenue as well as a 4% increase in operating expense.
Adjusted net cruise costs on a per night basis increased 4% primarily due to higher personnel and marketing expenses as we executed on our long-term growth strategy. Cost of tours in the fourth quarter declined slightly versus the same period a year ago as lower fuel and dry dock expenses were partially offset by higher charter cost, most notably, as I mentioned, from the addition of expeditions in Cuba during December. We also had reimbursement costs for guests that had changed travel plans due to the cancellation of the upcoming Orion voyages. Fuel costs in the fourth quarter were 16% below prior year and 4.4% of revenue compared with 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Total company net income in the quarter was a loss of $8.4 million or $0.19 per share as compared to a loss of $4.4 million or $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Current quarter results include the lower operating results we just discussed as well as $1.2 million of other expenses, primarily related to the loss on disposal of the Endeavour. We also had accelerated depreciation on the Endeavour, in anticipation of its retirement.

Turning to our balance sheet, we remain extremely well positioned to invest in future growth opportunities. We ended the year with $135 million in unrestricted cash. Free cash flow for 2016 was a use of $45 million, including $37 million spent on the two new coastal vessels, and $33 million on the Endeavour II. Excluding these items and looking at only maintenance CapEx, free cash flow was $26 million in 2016.
Given the strength of our balance sheet, the confidence we have in our long-term growth opportunity and the belief that the company’s share and warrant prices are not reflective of the value of the company and our prospects, we did repurchase over $4.9 million in shares and warrants during the fourth quarter under our $35 million stock and warrant repurchase plan. This included nearly 309,000 shares of stock and over 855,000 warrants.
For the full year 2016, we repurchased approximately $10.3 million in stock and warrants and as of March 1 we have approximately $15 million remaining under the existing plan. It is really important to note that our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our existing business and external growth opportunities that will enhance our long-term growth profile.
Turning to the full year 2017, the Lindblad segment is currently pacing over $8 million ahead of the same point a year ago, despite the voyage cancellations on the Orion. This is primarily due to the additional inventory from the anticipated launch of the National Geographic Quest in June and from additional charter expeditions in Cuba in 2017.
We are currently at 82% of our full year projected ticket revenues for 2017, including the additional inventory versus 86% of the 2016 full year ticket revenue at the same time a year ago. 
Factoring in the current operating environment, the impact of the Orion cancellations and anticipated contributions from Natural Habitat we expect total company tour revenue in 2017 between $278 million to $284 million that would be 15% to 17% growth versus 2016. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $50 million to $52 million or 20% to 25% growth versus 2016. And as Sven mentioned, this is very important, we also remain firmly on track to meet the long-term financial objectives that were laid out when the company went public in 2015. Please note that these expectations are for the current expectations for the first quarter are to be down year-on-year due to the impact of the Orion cancellations, while Q3 and Q4 results were benefited from the launch of the National Geographic Quest.
Similarly 2016, the majority of our dry dock timing in the upcoming year is planned for the second and fourth quarter. Additionally, as I mentioned last quarter please note that natural habitat has seasonality to their results with the significant portion of their revenue in the second half of the year. And the majority of their annual adjusted EBITDA typically recognized during the fourth quarter. Thanks for your time this morning and now Sven and I will be happy to answer any question that you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Today's first question comes from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, guys this is actually Fred Whiteman on for Greg. I was just hoping you could rationalize sort of walk us through I think you said you were 82% booked for 2017 versus 86% last year. I know that you gave some figures on the prepared remarks about recent trends. I think you said January and February were up and December was up 15%. Could you sort of bridge those two numbers along some of the stronger recent commentary that you outlined?
Craig Felenstein
Sure. So, the real key for 2017 in terms of where we are versus 2016 is that we have a significant amount of additional inventory in 2017. And that really is predominately due to two items. The first is the launch of the National Geographic Quest which will launch at the end of June of the current year. So, that will provide us with significant amount of capacity and inventory in 2017. And we also have additional voyages on our charters in Cuba in 2017. In the current year of 2016, we only had about one month in December and in 2017 we will have the Cuba expeditions for the first three months as well as December for this year.

So, I think that's the first thing and the second thing that I would talk to is that the booking trends have as Sven mentioned been really strong since April of the last year. Since that point we have seen year-on-year growth in every single month. Since that point that growth has continued in the early part of this year in January and February and as of today we are not seeing any sign of slowing down. Obviously we will keep you guys updated on how we are doing as the year progresses but right now we feel very confident about our ability to reach our financial targets for the full-year.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, that makes sense. And then, if you look around the overall industry, we have seen some improving trends for North America source business to Europe. Is that sort of consistent with what you guys are seeing relative to just I know you have a longer booking window but should that benefit year-over-year.
Craig Felenstein
So, what we did for 2017 based on what happened in 2016, what we are seeing in 2016, we reduced our inventory in continental and Southern Europe. We did not know how long the effects would last of the sort of downward pressure in Europe and we moved the Orion in particular more into the northern parts sort of the Arctic and sub Artic parts of Europe. And so, the balance between the two having reduced the inventory in continental Europe and the migration further North has turned out to be a good combination of inventory. And in general, as Europe from everything I have heard in the industry, the interest in Europe is certainly increasing over what it was in 2016 where there was a huge amount of downward pressure.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, great. Then just one last one, could you just talk about the early feedback from the Cuba itineraries?
Sven-Olof Lindblad
The early feedback from the Cuba itineraries has been frankly mixed. Cuba is a complex country to operate in. I believe we've had a very strong on the ground presence our own presence working with the Cubans too and with the folks we have chartered the ship from to operate there. It has been a lot of work but that the level of work is diminishing as we sort of get our arms around the realities of the system if you will which is inconsistent at best and needs a lot of focus in order to keep it arm tracked. But we feel good about it. It is not to be underestimated that working there is complex.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Today's next question comes from Chris Woronka of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Woronka
Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask you on that data point you gave out on the $8 million being ahead of $8 million on bookings, is that if we kind of normalized that and we took out Quest, Cuba and Orion and kind of looked at maybe same-store that's possible with that Would that number still be positive or would it be closer flat?
Craig Felenstein
Hi, this is Craig. Thanks for question, Chris. It's a hard question to answer because obviously the guess that are both on those vessels may have opted for some of our other itineraries if they had decided to travel with us but just from a pure math perspective if you take out the out of that you just mentioned you probably would be pretty close to where you were at the same point a year ago and actually a new factor in that's for when you factor in Quest.
If you factor in the Orion we certainly would be ahead, so that the cancellation on Orion certainly had presented a headwind for us looking at 2017. And if you if the Orion hadn't happened and you didn't have the Quest and you didn't have Cuba you would still be ahead but that's obviously a lot of conjecture into that statement.
Chris Woronka
Sure, understood. And then on that have -- this will be your first full-year of ownership. Can you maybe give us a little color on where you are in terms of some of this thing? I know they are operating pretty autonomously but in terms of some of the things you guys are benefits you guys are thinking of taking up, kind of where are you in that process and what do you how do you see that unfolding this year?

Sven-Olof Lindblad
So, one of the things that we believed would be the case and has proven out is that our traveler and that expeditions traveler and the Nat Hab traveler are very similar types of people and they have a great and strong allegiance to the company's they do business with. And so, we have found that the ability to cross sell has been increasing in terms of those results. And we really haven't yet made that effort fully but we intent to accelerate that effort this year because we are doing a multitude of tests on their side and on our side to see what the response was about this concept of cross over.
So, our travelers actually quite omnivorous from the perspective of this isn't the only kind of travel they do and so they do like to take as far as they do like to do things that are different in the nature space. And so, this is proven to be I think advantageous because now when a traveler of ours wants to go to East Africa let's say on a safari they go with Nat Hab and all likelihood rather than somebody else and so it keeps it, hence the term keeping it in the family.
So, that is a primary benefit. Also we are going to be developing land-based programs that we will more aggressively offer our past guest audience under our brand in order to expand that net interest. So, it's a there is a bit of learning curve about adaption between two companies that have very loyal customers followings but the key is that the inclinations or the interest and the economics are rather similar.
Craig Felenstein
And just to add to that. We are also very fortunate that Nat Hab has some great ideas through Ben Bressler, the founder and CEO are now in a position where we are able to fund some of those capital expenditures. So, we have a rigorous program overview of those capital expenditures but we are also able to take advantage of accelerating their growth. So, there are some exciting ideas coming up with regard to potential for that business in its own right and we are excited by those opportunities because there will be crossover as Sven mentioned.
Chris Woronka
Great. Thanks, that's helpful. I guess just one more for Craig I suppose. Well Craig, what are you thinking in terms of oil and kind of FX baked into the guidance?
Craig Felenstein
Sure. So, from a fuel perspective, we are expecting there would be an increase in 2017 versus 2016. We are not going to talk specifically about how much we assume but obviously given where prices are today we don't expect them to stay at these low levels. Hopefully they do and that will be a opportunity for us but we certainly don't anticipate that being the case throughout 2017.
So, on the fuel front that's where we are. On the FX front, I think it's important to know that the majority of our revenue, the vast majority of our revenue is actually in US dollars. So, there really is not any large impact to revenues from the currency perspective. On the cost side, about 90% plus of our cost are also in US dollar. There is some cost in Euros that obviously is susceptible to any foreign currency fluctuations. But given the amount of impact that we see from US dollar revenue of the cost, we don't bake in any kind of currency fluctuations into our forward looking expectations.
Chris Woronka
Okay, very good. Thanks guys.

TOP 10
REASONS TO EXPEDITION WITH
LINDBLAD-NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC









1
The human genetic drive to head out in ships and discover new things. For 50 years, we’ve been introducing travelers to this exhilarating way to experience the planet's wonders.









2
Authentic expedition ships Ranging from 28 guests to 148 guests, our 11 ships, scaled to go where cruise ships can’t, are equipped to bring you deep inside places where no infrastructure of docks or ports exist.









3
More of what you’re ‘out there’ for An onboard fleet of Zodiacs, kayaks, paddle boards, and snorkel gear for all, lets us make up-close, personal discoveries virtually anywhere. Plus, bow cams, hydrophones, video microscopes to reveal wonders.









4
Exclusively ours: the undersea Discover the virtually unknown Antarctica, Arctic or Alaska beneath the ship—through our undersea specialist’s icy dives. Watch vivid HD video—in the dry warmth of the ship’s Lounge, perhaps with a cocktail in hand.









5
Renowned expedition teams Over 50 years, we achieved a reputation for the best expedition teams in the business. Their experience, personalities, superb spotting and storytelling skills ensure that you’ll see, do and understand more.









6
National Geographic photographers aboard Inspiration and expert tips from top pros on every departure of NG Explorer & NG Orion, and on select other departures. Hit the B&H gear lockers aboard to try out new cameras and glass. And when you book, find out about exclusive B&H gear discounts.









7
Lindblad-National Geographic Certified photo instructors-naturalists Aboard every ship, they help you with camera settings and basics, and to understand wildlife to better anticipate behavior that leads to great shots.









8
Global Perspectives Guest Speakers On NG Explorer—travel with experts from the top tiers of journalism, science, and exploration. And on all our trips, count on rewarding local encounters, from concerts to hang-outs.









9
Adventure without adversity We’re inspired by historic expeditions but—no deprivation. Dining is excellent, with an emphasis on sustainable, locally sourced ingredients wherever possible. Onboard Wellness makes exploring a mind-body activity. 









10
Going beyond limits & expectations To be on an expedition means to be free, no ‘port’ schedule. We can be the first to set foot somewhere—because we are an expedition travel company and this is our mission.

About this book
Stunning scenery, magnificent wildlife, and native cultures bring the Arctic to life in this unparalleled collection of photography. In never-before-seen photos from the world's finest nature photographers, The Arctic introduces the reader to this region in three sections the land and sea, the rich biodiversity, and the native peoples and explores the challenges facing each in its rapidly changing environment. While celebrated in The Arctic, these stunning images are a dramatic and timely demonstration of the constant transformation of the Arctic at a most critical time. With accompanying essays based on real-time experiences by a National Geographic explorer, The Arctic celebrates the region's beauty inspiring dreams of travel while simultaneously sounding a call to action to save this distant world that affects each of us in countless ways. These photo-filled pages capture not only the massive sheets of ice glowing under the midnight sun, but also the Arctic's rich variety of other wildlife. Also featured are the many indigenous Inuit communities who maintain their traditional way of life amid this stunning and harsh natural setting.
