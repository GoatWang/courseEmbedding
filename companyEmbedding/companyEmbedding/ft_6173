How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Home of the Secret Society of Smoked Mullet, what?

                    Englewood is a shared community, shared by Charlotte County and Sarasota County in Florida.   This picturesque little town is the gateway to Charlotte Counties beautiful pristine Beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. You have not lived until you jump into the beautiful green/blue water of the Gulf and watch dolphins, manatees and even manta rays swimming by you  (Don't touch them please, our nature friends are very sensitive)   The string of beaches include Stump Pass Beach, Englewood Beach,  Blind Pass--to us locals, that would be middle beach--and Manasota Beach.   I think Dr. Beach has never named any of our beaches on the top ten list, because he wants to keep them a secret to himself!!!  Who knows, I could be right about that!   

Oh, by the way, The Secret Society of The Smoked Mullets was started in 1996 when Englewood Florida Chamber President Nita Edmondson (Cole) was looking for a special recognition award for those in the Englewood community who had contributed to the area's successes, but may never have been recognized.  The name originated from Englewood's famous dish: the smoked mullet. Historical tales say when the mullet ran in Lemon Bay in the early days, they literally jumped into the rowboats, and "got tangled up in the ladies petticoats."  Anyone can be nominated, but past generations are given priority. Only the past winners can bring the names to the nomination meeting, and vote for the winners.  It's a lifetime honor to be chosen. Membership does not expire. (source, Englewood Chamber of Commerce)

                    Englewood still has the old Florida charm.  I love the drive down North Beach Road on Manasota Key.  Check out the shops on Dearborn Street and then watch the sun go down from the Lock & Key across from Chadwick Park on Englewood Beach.  I always feel relaxed in this coastal town.
