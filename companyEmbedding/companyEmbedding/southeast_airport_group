About SEADOG


The Southeast Airport Disaster Operations Group, or SEADOG, is an informal collection of airports who have come together to provide operational assistance to airports hit by natural disasters, such as hurricanes or floods. SEADOG coordinates fast responses to specific operational needs, supplying teams of volunteer airport staff and necessary equipment needed to return an airport to operational status. SEADOG works closely with WESTDOG, its Western U.S. counterpart. Participation in SEADOG is voluntary and open to all.

Georgia Guide and Deals


Eat a Peach may be the name of the iconic best-selling album by Georgia-based rockers the Allman Brothers Band, but it's also great advice for anybody looking for things to do in Georgia. Dickey Farms, located some 30 miles outside of the band's hometown of Macon, is the oldest of Georgia's many celebrated peach farms, and a great place to settle into a rocking chair and sink your teeth into Georgia's sweetest ...

Georgia Guide
Eat a Peach may be the name of the iconic best-selling album by Georgia-based rockers the Allman Brothers Band, but it's also great advice for anybody looking for things to do in Georgia. Dickey Farms, located some 30 miles outside of the band's hometown of Macon, is the oldest of Georgia's many celebrated peach farms, and a great place to settle into a rocking chair and sink your teeth into Georgia's sweetest treasure.

A different type of sweet yield can be found at The World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta. Here, visitors can glimpse Coke's secret formula and watch as the beloved soft drink is made and bottled. No guide to Atlanta would be complete without recommending a stroll through Centennial Olympic Park, a 21-acre park commemorating the site of the 1996 Olympics, before a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, where visitors can tour the reverend's birth home and see the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he served as co-pastor.

Of course, in Georgia, you don't just see history––you hear it. If the military drawbridges, dikes, and ditches at the Fort Pulaski National Monument in historic Savannah don't bring the Civil War to vivid life, the daily cannon firing surely will. Athens, home of the University of Georgia, produces its own historical booms inside of the 40 Watt Club, the legendary venue where hometown bands R.E.M and the B-52's got their start and where many top acts still perform.

To fully appreciate Georgia's history and culture, you may need a little perspective. Take a high-speed Swiss cable car to the top of Stone Mountain for sprawling views of Atlanta's skyline and the Appalachian Mountains, or visit Tybee Island off Georgia's coast, a great spot to fish, hike, or spot dolphins from a sun-soaked beach chair.

Georgia Guide

Eat a Peach may be the name of the iconic best-selling album by Georgia-based rockers the Allman Brothers Band, but it's also great advice for anybody looking for things to do in Georgia. Dickey Farms, located some 30 miles outside of the band's hometown of Macon, is the oldest of Georgia's many celebrated peach farms, and a great place to settle into a rocking chair and sink your teeth into Georgia's sweetest treasure.A different type of sweet yield can be found at The World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta. Here, visitors can glimpse Coke's secret formula and watch as the beloved soft drink is made and bottled. No guide to Atlanta would be complete without recommending a stroll through Centennial Olympic Park, a 21-acre park commemorating the site of the 1996 Olympics, before a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, where visitors can tour the reverend's birth home and see the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he served as co-pastor.Of course, in Georgia, you don't just see history––you hear it. If the military drawbridges, dikes, and ditches at the Fort Pulaski National Monument in historic Savannah don't bring the Civil War to vivid life, the daily cannon firing surely will. Athens, home of the University of Georgia, produces its own historical booms inside of the 40 Watt Club, the legendary venue where hometown bands R.E.M and the B-52's got their start and where many top acts still perform.To fully appreciate Georgia's history and culture, you may need a little perspective. Take a high-speed Swiss cable car to the top of Stone Mountain for sprawling views of Atlanta's skyline and the Appalachian Mountains, or visit Tybee Island off Georgia's coast, a great spot to fish, hike, or spot dolphins from a sun-soaked beach chair.
