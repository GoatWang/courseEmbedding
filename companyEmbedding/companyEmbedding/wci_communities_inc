History[edit]
WCI was founded in 1995 as WCI Communities Inc, purchased from Westinghouse Communities, Inc., retaining WCI initials in their new name. In 2002, WCI Communities, Inc. issued an Initial Public Offering and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol: WCI. WCI's current Chief Executive Officer and President is Keith Bass. WCI reorganized and emerged as a new privately held company on September 3, 2009.[1]
Heated Housing Market[edit]
WCI specialized in luxury and second homes and had solid growth since its founding reaching a height of $2.6B in sales and $186M in profit in 2005. They were sharply affected by the 2005 real estate downturn.[2] Several factors contributed to their need to reorganize. First, a significant portion of their business was in high rise towers. Once construction is started on high rise towers, it is difficult to cease construction and thereby control cost. Second, WCI speculated on large land purchases, carrying large debt on land that was subsequently devalued. Third, their regular (non-tower) communities had large unsold inventories that were also devalued during the downturn.[3] Eventually, the debt was too large to carry with their operating revenues and they filed for Chapter 11.
Imported Drywall[edit]
WCI is one of many real estate developers affected by the Chinese drywall controversy.[4] Like many other builders, they faced construction material supply shortages during the boom years and engaged contactors that used the faulty Chinese drywall. The issue was made part of the bankruptcy reorganization.[5] Claimants are represented by a trust established in the court approved Plan of Reorganization.
Awards and Community Involvement[edit]
America's Best Builder[edit]
The National Association of Home Builders and Builder Magazine named WCI "America's Best Builder" in 2004.[6]
Extreme Makeover - Home Edition[edit]
In January 2007, the company was featured on ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. Together with volunteers, sub-contractors, local businesses, and Tampa Bay area residents, WCI rebuilt a home in 96 hours for the Tate Family on Davis Island who had lost their home in a plane crash.[7]
Shark Shootout Golf Tournament[edit]
WCI is a major sponseor of the Shark Shootout golf tournament held at the Tiburon Golf resort in Naples, Florida. Tiburon is one of the communities developed by WCI Communities and features two golf courses and a Ritz Carlton Hotel. The annual event is professional golf tournament founded by Greg Norman and benefits the National Childhood Cancer Foundation

History[edit]
WCI was founded in 1995 as WCI Communities Inc, purchased from Westinghouse Communities, Inc., retaining WCI initials in their new name. In 2002, WCI Communities, Inc. issued an Initial Public Offering and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol: WCI. WCI's current Chief Executive Officer and President is Keith Bass. WCI reorganized and emerged as a new privately held company on September 3, 2009.[1]
Heated Housing Market[edit]
WCI specialized in luxury and second homes and had solid growth since its founding reaching a height of $2.6B in sales and $186M in profit in 2005. They were sharply affected by the 2005 real estate downturn.[2] Several factors contributed to their need to reorganize. First, a significant portion of their business was in high rise towers. Once construction is started on high rise towers, it is difficult to cease construction and thereby control cost. Second, WCI speculated on large land purchases, carrying large debt on land that was subsequently devalued. Third, their regular (non-tower) communities had large unsold inventories that were also devalued during the downturn.[3] Eventually, the debt was too large to carry with their operating revenues and they filed for Chapter 11.
Imported Drywall[edit]
WCI is one of many real estate developers affected by the Chinese drywall controversy.[4] Like many other builders, they faced construction material supply shortages during the boom years and engaged contactors that used the faulty Chinese drywall. The issue was made part of the bankruptcy reorganization.[5] Claimants are represented by a trust established in the court approved Plan of Reorganization.
Awards and Community Involvement[edit]
America's Best Builder[edit]
The National Association of Home Builders and Builder Magazine named WCI "America's Best Builder" in 2004.[6]
Extreme Makeover - Home Edition[edit]
In January 2007, the company was featured on ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. Together with volunteers, sub-contractors, local businesses, and Tampa Bay area residents, WCI rebuilt a home in 96 hours for the Tate Family on Davis Island who had lost their home in a plane crash.[7]
Shark Shootout Golf Tournament[edit]
WCI is a major sponseor of the Shark Shootout golf tournament held at the Tiburon Golf resort in Naples, Florida. Tiburon is one of the communities developed by WCI Communities and features two golf courses and a Ritz Carlton Hotel. The annual event is professional golf tournament founded by Greg Norman and benefits the National Childhood Cancer Foundation

History[edit]
WCI was founded in 1995 as WCI Communities Inc, purchased from Westinghouse Communities, Inc., retaining WCI initials in their new name. In 2002, WCI Communities, Inc. issued an Initial Public Offering and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol: WCI. WCI's current Chief Executive Officer and President is Keith Bass. WCI reorganized and emerged as a new privately held company on September 3, 2009.[1]
Heated Housing Market[edit]
WCI specialized in luxury and second homes and had solid growth since its founding reaching a height of $2.6B in sales and $186M in profit in 2005. They were sharply affected by the 2005 real estate downturn.[2] Several factors contributed to their need to reorganize. First, a significant portion of their business was in high rise towers. Once construction is started on high rise towers, it is difficult to cease construction and thereby control cost. Second, WCI speculated on large land purchases, carrying large debt on land that was subsequently devalued. Third, their regular (non-tower) communities had large unsold inventories that were also devalued during the downturn.[3] Eventually, the debt was too large to carry with their operating revenues and they filed for Chapter 11.
Imported Drywall[edit]
WCI is one of many real estate developers affected by the Chinese drywall controversy.[4] Like many other builders, they faced construction material supply shortages during the boom years and engaged contactors that used the faulty Chinese drywall. The issue was made part of the bankruptcy reorganization.[5] Claimants are represented by a trust established in the court approved Plan of Reorganization.
Awards and Community Involvement[edit]
America's Best Builder[edit]
The National Association of Home Builders and Builder Magazine named WCI "America's Best Builder" in 2004.[6]
Extreme Makeover - Home Edition[edit]
In January 2007, the company was featured on ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. Together with volunteers, sub-contractors, local businesses, and Tampa Bay area residents, WCI rebuilt a home in 96 hours for the Tate Family on Davis Island who had lost their home in a plane crash.[7]
Shark Shootout Golf Tournament[edit]
WCI is a major sponseor of the Shark Shootout golf tournament held at the Tiburon Golf resort in Naples, Florida. Tiburon is one of the communities developed by WCI Communities and features two golf courses and a Ritz Carlton Hotel. The annual event is professional golf tournament founded by Greg Norman and benefits the National Childhood Cancer Foundation

Venetian Golf & River Club from $200s to $700s
 
The scenic Myakka River meanders through North Venice on its way to the emerald waters of the Gulf of Mexico and its powder sand beaches. Here, on its banks, under the shade of towering oaks and cypress trees, is a WCI Communities masterpiece: Venetian Golf & River Club. Wide, gently undulating fairways, large greens, and a player's choice of five tee locations make the championship golf course a joy for those new to the game, and a challenge for serious players. Classic European architecture defines the magnificent Mediterranean-style Venetian Golf Club and The Venetian River Club, where the amenities will exceed your expectations: exceptional dining, fitness center, outdoor resort swimming pool, tennis facilities, pro shops-all yours to enjoy.
The spectacular River Walk is a bridge over wild palmetto palms, tropical grasses and bromeliads is a bird watcher's paradise. Your new home at Venetian Golf & River Club overlooks sparkling lakes and meticulously sculpted and maintained fairways. Your new lifestyle includes days of activity and two breathtakingly beautiful clubs.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Composite Score:





                        WCI Communities, Inc. has received 4.34 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
