Vistra Energy: 60%+ Upside Potential - Vistra Energy Corp. (NYSE:VST) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Vistra Energy: 60%+ Upside PotentialMar. 2.17 | About: Vistra Energy (VST) Antao Special situations, event-driven, hedge fund managerSummaryEmerging from bankruptcy with better-than-peer balance sheet and worse-than-peer multiples.Just applied with the SEC to be uplisted to NYSE, which should occur in the coming months.Possible upside of 60% to 85% in 1 to 2 years.Vistra Energy (VSTE) describes itself as a "premier Texas-based energy company focused on the competitive energy and power generation markets through operation as the largest retailer of electricity and generator in the growing Texas market". What they should be saying instead was: Vista Energy is the company put together by TXU Energy (later renamed Energy Futures Holdings) by their senior bondholders after taking control of the assets left behind on a messy Chapter 11 bankruptcy. We love messy bankruptcies, not the procedure itself but the companies that come to fruition as a result of it, as we tend to find many misplaced securities in that space. I wrote about another good opportunity in that space yesterday: Contura Energy (OTCPK:CNTE) (as discussed here). It seems that the wave of energy bankruptcies in recent years will keep bringing us a decent amount of opportunities. The opportunity is quite similar to that of Contura Energy, actually. In 2007, TXU - a producer and provider of electricity derived from coal-fired plants - was acquired by a group of PE firms (including KKR and Texas Pacific) for a whopping $45 B, making it the largest leveraged buyout in US history at the time. Even Warren Buffett got involved. Then, the financial crisis hit, rendering the assumptions on which the LBO was based obsolete. First, the debt of $37 B took on by TXU for the LBO was unbearable - their interest expense increased by more than 5-fold; second, the cornerstone of the deal was a bet that natural gas prices would rise and stay high in the future, giving their coal-fired plants a competitive advantage. They didn't. As a result margins compressed, their debt servicing became unbearable and they could not re-finance because of the financial crisis. Caution advises not to mix a cyclical business with debt that cannot be sustained during a downturn. The result was a 2-year long bankruptcy procedure that came to an end late last year.
 But enough with the sad stuff. There is always something positive in every situation, right? Indeed. As part of the reorganization plan, TXU was split into two companies: Oncor - the former regulated business of TXU, bought by NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), and Vistra - the former power generation and electricity retailer businesses, delivered to senior lenders. Vistra's operations are simple to understand. It has two businesses: TXU Energy and Luminant. TXU Energy sells retail electricity and value-added services to approximately 1.7 million residential and business customers in Texas. Luminant generates and sells electricity and related products from its diverse fleet of generation facilities totaling approximately 17,000 MW of generation in Texas, including 2,300 MW fueled by nuclear power, 8,000 MW fueled by coal and 6,000 MW fueled by natural gas, and is a large purchaser of wind-generated electricity. Basically, TXU buys electricity from Luminant and sells it at a small markup to retail clients. Energy prices seem to be recovering from last year's epic glut which means that industry tailwinds should propel the company. In any case, by integrating both companies, Vistra believes they can smooth out the cyclicality of each business (e.g. when energy prices are down, the power generation business suffers but is compensated by an increase in margins in the retail business and vice versa), which remains to be proven as market conditions change going forward. For now it is too early to tell. According to the company guidance, both companies seem evenly balanced, contributing by roughly 50% each to the company's EBITDA. But, is this a good opportunity? You bet. To study Vistra's peer group we resorted to the competitors identified by the company in their latest S-1 form filed with the SEC. From these, we selected 2 groups - one whose operations are the most identical to Vistra's (highlighted in green) and the other operating in the regulated utility business (highlighted in red).
 

 Source: Author using data from Morningstar and company financials Post-bankruptcy Vistra now has only $3.5 B of debt and $1.8 B of cash in their books for a $1.7 B net debt. Their adjusted EBITDA for 2016 is expected to be close to $1.6 B for a leverage of 1.1x and an EV/EBITDA of 5.4x. Comparing with its peers, Vistra appears as the least levered (by a mile) and the one with the smallest EBITDA multiple (even below the constituents of the red group). You would think that the company that has 1/5 of the debt would command a premium multiple, not a discounted one, right? Efficient markets, they say… Having said that, Vistra does have room to safely add considerably more debt - we see them able to double or even triple their debt - in order to leverage their operations, which would be a nice bump to EBITDA as an added bonus. At current market prices, this optionality is given for free, which is always good (those who read our articles know we sure love getting free stuff when investing). So, there you have it: Vistra is the safest company operating in the non-regulated space both because of their low leverage and their great value. When the market acknowledges the existence of Vistra, it should re-rate the company's multiple to a more adequate 8x - 9x EBITDA. By doing so, each share would sell for somewhere between $26 and $30, a 60% - 85% upside. So, how will Vistra get the market to re-rate them? Immediate catalysts are already in motion: Vistra Energy trades over-the-counter but last month they applied for their stock to be uplisted to NYSE, which means higher market visibility from institutions and analysts. The second catalyst is the presentation of FY16 earnings on March 30. If the company executed according to their forecasts an immediate stock price boost shall signal increasing confidence on the operative capabilities of the company. As an added bonus, once they post their first earnings, their numbers will appear in everybody's databases.
 The third catalyst is time. Normally, full re-rating of companies coming out of bankruptcy takes at least 1 year since the market requires at least 1 year of full operation to check on execution of the reorganization plan. Finally, there's management, which can take action to close their stock price's gap relative to their peers, namely through share repurchases, stock buybacks or going to conferences and doing presentations. This is especially true in the case of Vistra, which is 39% owned by Apollo, BAM and Oaktree. Directors appointed by these 3 shareholders will pay special attention to stock price performance. In conclusion, there is little to differentiate companies operating in a commodity business. Unless you have the low-cost advantage, your product costs the same as everyone else's which means your margins are roughly the same and your earnings are worth the same amount of dollars that your competitor's, provided that your balance sheet is clean. Because of this, the majority of the industry constituents should see the relative market value of their stock trade in a tight range. And that is true for everyone in the industry but Vistra, whose earnings are being valued by the market at a 30% to 40% discount relative to its direct competitors. The combination of Vistra's low valuation and the catalysts laid out above, we could be in for a very interesting ride as the market re-rates the company closer to its peers.

DALLAS, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TCEH Corp. (OTCQX: THHH) today announced a new name, Vistra Energy, that builds upon the company's 130-year track record of serving Texans and launches toward a revitalized future as a leading, dynamic energy player in Texas. As the parent company of TXU Energy and Luminant, Vistra Energy will provide customer-focused service as the state's largest electric retailer backed by safe, reliable power generation for the growing Texas market. Vistra Energy will also continue a long-standing commitment to support the communities in which its subsidiaries and predecessor companies have operated for many decades. 








TCEH Corp. recently emerged from Chapter 11 as a standalone company, effected through a tax-free spinoff from Energy Future Holdings Corp. The rebranded entity Vistra Energy includes TCEH's experienced management team, led by Chief Executive Officer Curt Morgan.
"The energy market in Texas – and beyond – has never been more exciting and transformative," Mr. Morgan said. "This includes new technologies that are reimagining how we generate energy, and unprecedented choice and control for today's energy consumers. The Vistra Energy brand is intended to capture the full opportunity set before us, backed by a proud history, the industry's best team of professionals, stellar operating assets and a strong balance sheet."
The name Vistra Energy captures the "vision" of an energy company preparing for the future and the "tradition" of an energy company whose lineage dates more than a century. With a foundation of customer service and operational excellence going back generations, the company is now well-capitalized and well-positioned to take advantage of near- and long-term opportunities to grow.
In connection with today's announcement, Vistra Energy has launched a new online presence at www.vistraenergy.com. Information concerning TXU Energy and Luminant can be found at www.txu.com and www.luminant.com.

Stock market closes higher, but books weekly loss amid White House drama

May. 19, 2017 at 4:55 p.m. ET
by Barbara Kollmeyer









U.S. stocks open slightly higher, but on track for down week as volatility returns
U.S. stocks edged up in early trading on Friday, as investors enjoyed a rare respite from dramatic news coming out of Washington, although major indexes were set for their second straight weekly decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 31 points, or 0.2%, to 20,691. The S&P 500  added 3.8 points to 2,370, a rise of 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite Index  climbed 19 points, or 0.3%, to 6,075. For the week, all three indexes are set for a decline of about 1%. Much of the weakness came in Wednesday's massive selloff, when concerns spiked over whether President Donald Trump could get his economic agenda passed, something analysts say is necessary to justify market valuations. Among the major movers, Deere & Co.  surged 6.3% after it reported earnings and sales that beat expectations. Dynegy Inc.  spiked 26% on reports it had received a buyout offer from Vistra Energy .

May. 19, 2017 at 9:31 a.m. ET
by Ryan Vlastelica









Dynegy's stock soars after report of buyout approach; analyst suggests it could go a lot higher
Shares of Dynegy Inc.  shot up 24% toward a three-month high in premarket trade Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the power company was approached by rival Vistra Energy Corp.  regarding a potential takeover. Analyst Ali Agha at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said his analysis derives a $14-per-share net asset value for Dynegy, which would be 93% above Thursday's closing price of $7.26, and would give the company a market capitalization of about $1.84 billion. Agha Vistra buying Dynegy "would make strategic sense" because it would allow Vistra to diversify out of the Texas power market; Dynegy has a relatively small exposure in Texas, implying market power concerns would not be an issue; and because Vistra Chief Executive Curt Morgan used to work at Energy Capital Partners, which is Dynegy's largest shareholder. Dynegy's stock traded at $8.99 about 45 minutes before open, the highest level seen during regular session hours since Feb. 24. The stock had tumbled 14% year to date through Thursday, while Vistra shares had lost 4.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 5.7%.

Vistra Energy Reports 2016 Results and Reaffirms 2017 Guidance


March 30, 2017

DALLAS, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra Energy (OTCQX: VSTE), the parent company for TXU Energy and Luminant, today reported its 2016 financial and operational results.  Vistra Energy's predecessor entity, TCEH Corp., emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 3, 2016, on which date Vistra Energy adopted fresh-start accounting, which resulted in Vistra Energy becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes.  As a result, Vistra Energy's 2016 results are reported for the predecessor entity for the period from January 1, 2016 through October 2, 2016 (the "Predecessor") and for the successor entity for the period from October 3, 2016 through December 31, 2016 (the "Successor").  
The financial statements of Vistra Energy for periods on or after October 3, 2016 are not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor prior to that date, as those previous periods do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying values of assets or amounts of liabilities that resulted from the plan of reorganization, and the related application of fresh-start reporting, which includes accounting policies implemented by Vistra Energy that differ from those of the Predecessor.  Please refer to our 2016 Annual Report for additional discussion regarding the accounting impacts of our emergence from Chapter 11 and the application of fresh-start accounting to our GAAP financial statements.  Our 2016 Annual Report can be found in the investor relations section of Vistra Energy's website at www.vistraenergy.com.  
Given the impacts of fresh-start accounting and the implementation of the plan of reorganization on GAAP earnings in 2016, Vistra Energy believes its non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow are more meaningful in evaluating its full-year performance.  Vistra Energy's management team evaluates its financial and operational results utilizing these non-GAAP measures.  Combining the 2016 results of the Predecessor and the Successor, Vistra Energy reported 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $1,601 million and, after adjusting the presentation of adjusted free cash flow to exclude changes in working capital and margin deposits, Vistra Energy reported 2016 adjusted free cash flow of $886 million.
Curt Morgan, Vistra Energy's chief executive officer, commented, "2016 was a highly productive year for Vistra Energy, as we delivered very strong results under difficult market conditions, demonstrating the resilience of our integrated model and high-performing commercial and retail operations.  We exited bankruptcy with a strong and flexible capital structure, and restructured our support organization costs, paving the way to excel in a highly competitive and challenged marketplace.  As we move forward into 2017, we are focused on finalizing the process to list on the New York Stock Exchange, improving our plant performance including portfolio optimization, and implementing our capital allocation process, all with an eye toward delivering value to our shareholders."
2017 Guidance
Vistra Energy is reaffirming its 2017 guidance, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA range of $1,350 million to $1,500 million and an adjusted free cash flow range of $745 million to $925 million. 
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2016, Vistra Energy had cash and cash equivalents of $843 million, $131 million in available letter of credit capacity under its term loan C facility, and $860 million of availability under its revolving credit facility, which remained undrawn at December 31, 2016.
Earnings Conference Call
Vistra Energy will host a conference call today, March 30, 2017, beginning at 11 a.m. EDT (10 a.m. CDT) to discuss these results and related matters.  The live, listen-only webcast of the conference call can be accessed via the investor relations section of Vistra Energy's website at www.vistraenergy.com.  For those unable to participate in the live event, a replay of the call will be available on the Vistra Energy website for one year following the call. 
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Items Affecting Comparability
"Adjusted EBITDA" (EBITDA as adjusted for unrealized gains or losses from hedging activities, tax receivable agreement obligations, reorganization items, and certain other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases); and "adjusted free cash flow" (cash from operating activities excluding changes in margin deposits and working capital and adjusted for capital expenditures, other net investment activities, preferred stock dividends, and other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases), are "non-GAAP financial measures." A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in Vistra Energy's consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Vistra Energy's non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Vistra Energy uses adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance and believes that analysis of its business by external users is enhanced by visibility to both net income prepared in accordance with GAAP and adjusted EBITDA. Vistra Energy uses adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity and believes that analysis of its ability to service its cash obligations is supported by disclosure of both cash provided by (used in) operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as adjusted free cash flow.  The schedules attached to this earnings release reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are forward-looking statements.  These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "shall," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "forecast," "goal," "target," "would" and "outlook," or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although Vistra Energy believes that in making any such forward-looking statement, Vistra Energy's expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such forward-looking statement involves uncertainties and risks, including the following important factors, among others, that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in or implied by such forward-looking statements:

general industry trends; 
economic conditions, including the impact of an economic downturn; 
weather conditions, including drought and limitations on access to water, and other natural phenomena, and acts of sabotage, wars or terrorist or cybersecurity threats or activities; 
the actions and decisions of regulatory authorities and credit rating agencies; 
our ability to collect trade receivables from our customers; 
our ability to attract, retain and profitably serve customers; 
restrictions on competitive retail pricing; 
changes in wholesale electricity prices or energy commodity prices or changes in market heat rates in the ERCOT electricity market; 
changes in prices of transportation of natural gas, coal, fuel and other refined products; 
our ability to effectively hedge against unfavorable commodity prices, including the price of natural gas and market heat rates; 
population growth or decline, or changes in market supply or demand and demographic patterns, particularly in ERCOT; 
access to adequate transmission facilities to meet changing demands; 
changes in interest rates, commodity prices, rates of inflation or foreign exchange rates; 
changes in operating expenses, liquidity needs and capital expenditures; 
commercial bank market and capital market conditions and the potential impact of disruptions in United States and international credit markets; 
access to capital, the attractiveness of the cost and other terms of such capital and the success of financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the capital markets; 
competition for new energy development and other business opportunities; 
changes in technology (including large scale electricity storage) used by and services offered by us; 
changes in electricity transmission that allow additional power generation to compete with our generation assets; 
limitations on our ability to utilize previously incurred federal net operating losses or alternative minimum tax credits; and 
hazards customary to the industry and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses resulting from such hazards
Any forward-looking statement speaks only at the date on which it is made, and except as may be required by law, Vistra Energy undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them; nor can Vistra Energy assess the impact of each such factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Amanda B.
California





has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus! 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

I like the taste ! but bI don't drink energy drunk too often. That's why I'm not going to purchase the product.  But I do recommend people to try and  then they can decide for themselves.
Would you purchase again? -  No

Erick L.

This product was tasting and refreshing. It helped provide energy. I'm not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

kiven c.

The good things I like about this energy drink is very low in calorie and it is organic which I really love because I don't really see any energy drink that is organic. 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Vianey G.

Unfortunately I did not receive the coupon for this in the mail. However, I did try it when I saw it at Sprouts. I liked the flavor but I am not so sure if it helped with my levels of energy. 
Would you purchase again? -  No

Soila G.

The taste is good but the price to get it is so expensive, and is hard to get this product isnt easy to find it in the stores and when you find it dont have to many flavors
Would you purchase again? -  No
original review



  


jeremy G.
California





I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review






Erob J.
California





Great Taste and quite a Boost. Perfect for tired driving or late night Study! Have quite a few friends that love GURU also and it's Organic.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review



  


Tiffany M.
California





Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review

it gave me a great boost to start my day for it was very energizing and what really caught my eye was that it was only ten calories! TEN!    #try natural

I liked the taste and the fact there was no after taste. Seems like a healthier alternative to the rock star drinks I usually drink. The ingredients make it for a less guilty feeling when drinking an energy drink.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

The product that I used was guru.  I love this product because it's organic all-natural and has no aftertaste or side effects. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and I will purchase it.

Delicious with minimal to no crash! I did not feel jittery like I did with other energy drinks! Will definitely purchase again, especially for the 3PM slow...

I thought the taste was wonderful. It is nice to see an organic energy drink that burst of flavor.  And is lightly carbonated this is definitely a great drink when you need that extra pep.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review



  


Talia H.

The energy drink is great to drink in the morning to get rid of the grogginess after a late night. I doesn't bring you up as high as caffeine, but it settles in with your current mood as a stabilizer.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review






Linda K.

Good tasting for an energy drink.  It didn't give me a big rush nor a big crash at the end either. Just a nice drink.  I'd drink it again. Thanks.

CHARLES B.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Eva T.

Purchased at Vons. Metallic taste and didn't notice an energy boost at all. A bit overpriced and more of a niche product, than a nutritional function type beverage.
Would you purchase again? -  No

Great taste! I love organic energy drinks. 
Very low calories and vegan. Also gluten free so whoever needs the gluten free energy drinks, it's here.
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!
original review






Deborah R.
California





I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Melissa E.

It had a taste like nothing I've tasted before. For being organic, and I'm not a big health nut or would remotely grab anything off a shelf that said organic on it, but it wasn't half bad. I'd purchase again if I needed a pick me upper and health drink in one:0

Honestly, I much rather drink this organic energy drink rather then regular energy drinks any day! However, I do not normally drink energy drinks.

I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.  This drink did not give my an amped up feeling or jitters, which I always appreciate. It honestly is a drink I would purchase again. I hope this can pops up on more stores' shelves.

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation.

I was happy to find the product provided being sold at Sprouts.

I really enjoyed drinking this energy drink, i love how it has only 10 calories! Everyone should try this organic, vegan and non-gmo drink. Why isn't this the new thing ?

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce. Guru engery drinks did the job for when I needed an extra boost. As far as taste go I find it similar to the other drinks I had before. If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

I really enjoyed the Guru organic energy drink. I didn't feel any crash and the taste was really good. I liked that it is only 5 calories for the Lite so I didn't feel guilty drinking an energy drink. It helped me stay energized enough to get through the work day after a long night. I would definitely buy this and recommend to a friend.

I was somewhat skeptical about this product, being a consumer of the energy drink that gives you "wings".  But I was very surprised when I took that first sip.  Yummy!  And unlike that shaky, jittery feeling I get from that other product I just felt alert. I tried the original GURU, and I loved the taste and I will definitely be buying GURU in the future!  Yummy!  #trynatural

Wow, this is definitely one of the best tasting energy drinks out on the market.  It has a really nice, sweet flavor to it, and has zero aftertaste.  You can definitely taste the white grape juice, but it's not overpowering   I definitely felt it starting to work immediately, which I also enjoy with energy drinks, as I like to sip them over the course of my afternoon.  I would definitely buy this one again as it was in the same price point as my other usual energy drinks.  I would also recommend it to a friend if they wanted a sweet, pick-me-up to keep them going,

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I don't usually drink energy drinks because of all the artificial ingredients but I liked Guru because it's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains healthy  ingredients like Guarana and Green Tea.

Guru Energy Drink is one of a kind. This drink smells great. The taste is a little on the bitter side. This is my personal opinion. It does have echinacea flower extract, in which I do like. I feel an organic energy and no jitters at all. I like this drink. It is an acquired taste though.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.
When I need an energy drink again, I will definitely buy this one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming. It gave me energy like a normal energy drink would. It is a good-sized drink and has a total of 143 milligrams of caffeine which is only 20 milligrams less than the Monsters that I usually drink. I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things. At first, it sort of reminded me of Coca-Cola. Then, the second half sort of reminded me of a 7-11 slurpee. Despite those connotations, it did not taste thick and sugary. It was pretty light and I felt great after drinking it.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Midday and I just ate too much for lunch and all I wanted to do was take a nap. It was a perfect time to give Guru a try.

Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

I purchased the Lite Guru instead or the regular because it only has 3g of sugar compared to the 37g in the regular one. I really enjoyed this energy drink. It has a great taste and it didn't make me jittery. It gave me just enough energy and I would purchase it again.

A good drink if you are able to find the lite version. The regular version is basically all sugar, which I do not like. The lite version is much better but harder to find. Taste is good, on par with other energy drinks. Not sure if being organic is worth the extra retail cost though.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it! Thanks for the opportunity to taste.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option.

A great pick me up...... recommend this as a before workout drink so you can quickly burn the sugar.  I wish they used organic sugar vice corn syrup which is more in keeping with organic ingredients.  The Lite version uses Stevia which is much better.
I like the product and will continue to use as a pre-run supplement, but in the Lite version only.

I would like to point out first that it seems that only the "original" flavor is organic (if that is something that is important to you). It did have a slight Red Bull like taste but overall it is one of the better tasting energy drinks. It didn't make me super jittery but it did give me a lil extra pep to make it through a late night.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor. I do feel energized, but I don't feel ill like some energy drinks can make you feel. Guru is refreshing and reading the ingredients the first thing I see is sparkling water. There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day. I would give a higher score, but whoo that aftertaste was something else; however it's nothing unbearable, just a slight bitterness. The drink itself is sweet though, the bitterness only comes after. My husband will probably stick to his normal energy drink, but I like this one myself.

For a natural energy drink, Guru was great. I liked that I knew what I was putting in my body and that the lite version of this drink only has 5 calories. However, I don't feel like it amped me up as much as a "regular" energy drink. It was a great substitute for my morning coffee, but I wouldn't rely on it for an all-nighter.

I work hard and I play hard, so sometimes I need a pick-me-up.

As a monster fanatic and a diabetic I am always happy to try new energy drinks that will give me the energy I need without the sugar that I don't need. Guru is a great substitute for the sugary/no sugar energy drinks.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor.

I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

One of the best energy drinks I ever tried.  Didnt leave me feeling jittery.  The taste was not as sweet as other energy drinks. I like that it is organic, vegan and gluten free.  I would definately buy this again.  It was easy to find at the grocery store.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash. That being said if you have been up for two days you will not reap the full benefits of any energy drink, get some sleep.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I appreciated the chance to try this drink. It's great to have a healthier organic alternative without the additives & artificial flavours that are part of many energy drinks.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.
