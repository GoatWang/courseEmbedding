Match Group, Inc. Key Developments

Match Group Launches New Dating Brand for Singles 50 and over in Europe
Jun 19 17
Match Group announced the launch of a new dating brand across Europe, focused solely on singles over 50. Designed and developed by Match Group's European business Meetic, the brand operates under DisonsDemain in France and Ourtime in the UK, and leverages Match Group's experience with a similar business also called Ourtime, which it launched in the U.S. in 2011. The European version of the service allows singles to meet through online connections, but also at real world events specifically organized for them. It is supported by a full offline and digital plan and will benefit from the same expertise in terms of dating, technological innovation, advanced algorithms, data protection, and strong customer service that has made Match Group the world's leading dating service provider.
