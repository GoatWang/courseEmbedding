Satish Hemachandran Named Carestream Dental’s New General Manager of Practice Management Software
Published on June 22, 2017 by Orthodontic Practice

ATLANTA—Carestream Dental is pleased to announce that Satish Hemachandran has accepted the position of general manager of its practice management software business. In this role, he will be responsible for the overall strategy, resource allocation, operational execution and customer experience for dental practice management solutions (DPMS).
“Satish brings a wealth of cloud and software industry experience that will be critical to Carestream Dental’s success as we drive further growth and investment in our practice management business,” Lisa Ashby, global president, Carestream Dental, said. “His expertise will be invaluable in delivering the software solutions customers need to manage and grow their businesses, and his passion around the customers experience will enable us to continue to sharpen our focus and deliver the service our customers expect.”
Hemachandran joins Carestream Dental from Internap, where he served most recently as senior vice president and general manager of its Cloud and Hosting Services business unit. During his time at Internap, Hemachandran successfully integrated several of the company’s hosting acquisitions and completed its strategic product transformation towards cloud and managed services, which became a significant part of the company’s revenue.
Prior to Internap, Hemachandran held leadership roles at Cbeyond and SunGard, and he began his career as a support engineer at Netscape, followed by Sun Microsystems. Hemachandran holds an MBA from Emory University, a master’s degree from University of Toledo and a bachelor’s degree from Anna University, India.
As part of Carestream Dental’s initiatives this year, Hemachandran will lead the software business as it delivers meaningful enhancements and resources for users with quicker turnaround time. The recently launched EMR Elite module for CS WinOMS v 9.0 is an example of one such enhancement, with more to come throughout the year.
“Carestream Dental is uniquely positioned to help dental practitioners of all sizes and specialties adapt and thrive in the era of mobile, social and cloud computing, and the company has already made tremendous progress in helping customers manage their practices with enterprise-class control and security,” Hemachandran said. “I am excited to join the team at this critical time in the industry to help accelerate our momentum in practice management software.”
