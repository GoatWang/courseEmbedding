 Better Angels CD music Product Description

Better Angels album for sale by John Mclean was released Sep 18, 2007 on the Origin label. Guitarist John McLean's Better Angels is certainly difficult to classify. Better Angels songs Some pieces, such as "Ready for the War," come across as modern pop.  Others are closer to the music of the Pat Metheny Group, while a few tunes are modernized swing standards including one of the strangest versions of "Airmail Special" one will ever hear. Better Angels album for sale While there are some individual spots, the emphasis during most of the selections is on the haunting ensemble sound which features McLean's regular group plus guest violinist Karl Montzka and occasionally the mostly wordless voice of Grazyna Auguscik. Better Angels CD music The intriguing results are worth several listens; although unsettling at times, the music is fresh and new. Better Angels buy CD music ~ Scott YanowPersonnel: John McLean (guitar); John McLean (guitars); Larry Kohut (bass guitar); Grazyna Auguscik (vocals); Zach Brock (violin); Jim Gailloreto (saxophone); Karl Montzka (organ); Eric Montzka (drums). Recording information: 08/24/2004/08/25/2004. Photographer: Todd Bishop. .

JazzTimes (pp.114-115) - "McLean tackles swing standards, gloomy pop songs and three speedy, pulse-quickening original tunes."

 Easy Go CD music Product Description

Easy Go album for sale by John Mclean was released Mar 12, 2013 on the Premonition label. Many listeners have been anticipating the release of Chicago, IL-based jazz guitarist John McLean's debut as a leader, thanks to his sterling performances and recordings with modern jazz diva Patricia Barber. Easy Go buy CD music An educator and much in demand session ace who has also worked with trumpeter Randy Brecker, saxophonist Arthur Blythe, and others of note, the guitarist's fluid right-hand leads, effective use of volume control techniques, and impressive agility come to fruition on this 2001 effort. Easy Go songs With the piece titled "Fat Chance," the artist and Hammond B-3 specialist Karl Montzka project a soulful vibe via alternating swing vamps and punchy choruses. Easy Go album for sale Saxophonist Jim Gailloretto's edgy lines and soulful phraseology provide the knockout punch to this well-balanced program. Easy Go CD music The band executes a somewhat organic, yet altogether climactic, rendition of the late bassist Jaco Pastorius' lovely "Three Views of a Secret." Easy Go buy CD music Otherwise, session drummer of choice Adam Nussbaum helps drive this quintet through a series of swiftly moving post-bop numbers and four-bar blues motifs, not to mention the turbocharged spin on the late Woody Shaw's composition "Blues for Wood." Easy Go songs Overall, McLean exhibits the characteristics of a well-studied jazz musician amid his effortless control, flair for the dynamic, and multifarious approach to compositional form. Recommended. ~ Glenn AstaritaPersonnel: John McLean (guitar); Jim Gailloretto (saxophone); Karl Montzka (piano, Hammond B-3 organ); Larry Kohut (bass); Adam Nussbaum (drums). Liner Note Author: Michael Friedman. Personnel: John McLean (guitar); Jim Gailloreto (saxophone); Larry Kohut (acoustic bass); Adam Nussbaum (drums). Audio Mixers: Jim Anderson ; John McLean.

Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of John McLean can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month

About an ordinary mandoing extraordinary things


Personal ChangeYou can count on one hand those who've had what it takes to both swim the Channel and complete the Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon, one of the world's most demanding tests of endurance. John has completed the Hawaii Ironman three times, and was the first wheelchair athlete to swim the English Channel. He has represented his country at Olympic and Paralympic games, winner of a Silver medal rowing in Beijing in 2008. John has competed in over 20 of the worlds most challenging sporting events, in his 25 years as a wheelchair athlete. He has competed in overseven different sporting disciplines including triathlon, long distance swimming, rowing, paddling, wheelchair racing, hand-cycling and basketball.John's extraordinary spirit and stamina continues to inspire us as we celebrate him completing his first triathlon as a conventional athlete. After an accident 26 years ago left John an incomplete paraplegic facing life in a wheelchair, John Maclean left his wheels behind on the 26th of October 2014 and completed the Nepean Triathlon as a conventional athlete.
