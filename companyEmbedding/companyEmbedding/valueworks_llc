LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

ValueWorks LLC : Top Money Managers  








ValueWorks






































































Quality Assets at Compelling Valuations











 We are value investors.Our name means a lot to us.  We believe that value investing works because controlling quality assets at a discount to what they are worth earns attractive returns over time.  This principle is the core of each investment decision we make. Every security is a financial instrument that represents some type of claim against assets.  It is the work of every value investor to understand what those assets are, what they are worth, and what price they are paying to control them when they buy a security.We are value investors because we have conviction in the underlying logic of the approach.  We have also had the benefit of testing this discipline through some extraordinary – and extraordinarily different – market periods. Value investing is not always easy, and is not always in fashion.  It is a straightforward proposition but it requires both a high level of expertise and steadfast discipline to use it adeptly in all sorts of economic and market climates.    At ValueWorks we have deployed this approach through periods of huge investor enthusiasm and euphoria, through periods of financial crisis and panic, and even through some moments of calm and investor ennui.  Through it all, we have stayed with this discipline, and draw the simple conclusion that is in our name.   



This fund was ranked based on the data in Barclay Hedge's hedge fund database 
  















How We Think











 PhilosophyAt ValueWorks we define value investing as buying the best-quality assets at the best possible prices. We like to think of ourselves as bargain hunters: it is our goal to pay only $0.50 to $0.75 for $1.00 worth of assets. We evaluate the component parts of a company, assigning each of its assets a dollar value that, when added together, comprises the underlying value of the company; if this is higher than the company’s stock price, we consider it an investment opportunity.These principles are straightforward, but converting them into practice requires a sophisticated and consistent process. It entails extensive independent research, a high level of expertise—in appraising both assets and claims—and the discipline not to be led by emotions when market conditions are volatile.RiskRisk is best controlled in our process through knowledgeable security selection, reasonable diversification and steadfast discipline.  Careful and diligent security selection can lower the chances that we simply make a mistake and mis-appraise the assets or liabilities; and it can limit the likelihood that something changes in a unexpected way to fundamentally alter the math.  Diversification can limit the impact of a single mistake; it can also limit the impact of a company, sector or group going more out of favor and trading at a larger discount to the underlying value. In periods where investor enthusiasm or despair drive overall valuation to particularly large premiums or discounts to underlying value, ValueWorks has found the best risk control to be discipline.  Our experience has been that those larger disconnects, whether in a sector or the overall market, run their course remarkably quickly; often during these events the emotional temptation is to move in a certain direction and it is discipline that keeps the portfolio on track for long term results. 















Our Investment Process











 On any given day, security prices reflect and react to many factors beyond the underlying value of a business.  Such disparities between a security’s price and a business’s value are what we as value investors seek out.  At ValueWorks once we identify this type of situation we then look for opportunities where the value of the underlying assets is growing, and where the disparity in valuation is expected to narrow. We do this by using a well-planned series of steps.  1. IdentificationWe often find investment opportunities where quality securities have fallen out of favor with the market. Whether or not we identify a security through this contrarian approach, we will always determine if a security is a promising prospect by submitting it to an abbreviated version of our process. If the security passes this initial test, we will then take an in-depth look at the company.2. AssessmentWhen we value a company, we determine its ‘underlying value’ by identifying, analyzing and pricing its assets. We also determine whether the asset base is likely to increase in value over time. We will decide to invest in a company only if its assets are currently undervalued and appreciating.3. AppraisalOnce we determine that a security trades for less than the value of its assets, we identify the key factors that could eliminate this valuation gap and increase the security’s price. We then identify and value all the claims against the company’s assets. Only then can we evaluate the price required to control a particular instrument—and make either a positive or negative investment decision.4. Re-evaluationWe monitor our portfolios to ensure that companies continue to exhibit the traits that originally made them good investments. We are also watchful so that changes in market conditions do not unexpectedly alter the merits of particular investments. 5. ExitWe sell securities when they have realized our estimate of their assets’ value, or when new developments lead us to believe that part of our original conclusion to buy them is no longer valid. 















Portfolio Structures











 We translate our value discipline into a number of different portfolio architectures designed to meet specific investor objectives.  We manage individual portfolios that are each grouped into a composite of similar portfolios that employ a set of portfolio rules.In every composite we seek to create diversification by building exposure to a large number of industries and sectors rather than by simply including a large number of individual companies.  By our measure, there is more diversification in 25 securities spread among fifteen industries than 100 securities spread across five industries.   Then, for each group of accounts, we use different rules to build portfolios that fulfill particular investor objectives.  These composite rules guide the mix of asset classes (equities, high yield, investment grade debt), as well as market capitalization, position size, use of leverage, and short exposure.Generally, we offer independent investment management in a Separately Managed Account (SMA) format.  This structure provides transparency, flexibility, and the opportunity for customization.  Other account formats are available for particular portfolio architectures—feel free to ask us about what is available and what is appropriate. 















The Team











Charles Lemonides, Founder







Charles founded ValueWorks with the goal to broaden availability of his conceptual value investing discipline in the retail and institutional investor communities.  Charles leads investment research and portfolio management at ValueWorks and has final authority for all investment decisions.  Charles’ philosophy of value investing was born at the regional brokerage Gruntal & Co.  During his tenure in Gruntal’s Research Department beginning in 1986, Charles honed skills covering risk arbitrage, the banking industry, and special situations.  He notably spearheaded the addition of high yield bonds and distressed securities to the department’s coverage.  In 1994, Charles joined Sterling Advisors, an investment advisory unit of Gruntal & Co.; he became Chief Investment Officer of Sterling the following year.  In 1999 Charles merged this internal investment practice into the independent advisory firm M&R Capital.  As  Chief Investment Officer of M&R Charles began branding the composites he brought over from Sterling under a ValueWorks banner, laying the ground for establishing ValueWorks as a fully independent firm in October of 2001. Charles received his Bachelor’s degree in History from Vassar College and pursued graduate studies in Economics at New York University.  He received his CFA designation in 1989 and is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts. Charles has been featured in prominent print and broadcast financial media throughout his career.  Charles is a lifelong New Yorker and an avid traveler.  The only place he finds more engaging than NYC is the place on the map he is visiting next.Steve Zell, Chief Operating Officer

Steve received Bachelor’s degrees in Philosophy and the History of Mathematics from St John’s College, Santa Fe, NM.  Steve lives in Brooklyn NY with his wife and two children, but he can often be found exploring the area around Bozeman MT.Eric Lilly, Director of Research and Trading

 PAST PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  ValueWorks is a Registered Investment Adviser.  ValueWorks has prepared and presented this information in compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).  The firm maintains a complete list and description of composites, which is available upon request. Results are based on fully discretionary accounts under management, including those accounts no longer with the firm.  The Capital Appreciation Composite contains all accounts with a Capital Appreciation mandate; for comparison purposes this composite is measured against the S&P 500 Index.  The Balanced Composite contains all accounts with a Balanced mandate; for comparison purposes this composite is measured against a 50/50 blend of S&P 500 and Merrill Lynch Master Bond Indices.  The Long-Biased Composite contains all accounts with a Long-Biased mandate; for comparison purposes this composite is measured against the S&P 500. The above benchmark indices are unmanaged indices.  Beta was calculated using the S&P 500 as the market proxy for the Capital Appreciation and Long Biased Composites; the 50/50 Blended Index was used as the market proxy for the Balanced Composite.  Index performance numbers reflect the reinvestment of dividends and interest, but do not reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses. ValueWorks’ value investing style is not limited to the securities in any of the above indices and utilizes specific investment techniques which are not utilized in the above indices and which may increase volatility.  All composite returns include all dividends, interest, accrued interest and other cash flows received as they may result from the implementation of a particular investment strategy. Trade Date Accounting has been used.  Results for the full period are time weighted.  Accounts are included in composite at the start of the first full month under management. Exiting accounts are included through the last full month under management.The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance.  Returns are presented gross and net of management fees and include the reinvestment of all income.  The annual composite dispersion presented is an asset-weighted standard deviation calculated for the accounts in the composite the entire year.  Additional information regarding the policies for calculating and reporting returns is available upon request. The investment management fee schedule is as follows: Management Fee, 1.5%; Performance Allocation, 20% (Long-Biased Composite ONLY).  Individual accounts can negotiate.  Actual investment advisory fees incurred by clients will vary.In the Long-Biased Composite leverage/derivatives may make up a material part of the composite strategy.  The strategy used in this composite uses leverage that can total 150% of capital and short positions that can total 50% of capital.  These techniques can increase volatility.  The Capital Appreciation Composite and Balanced Composite were created December 31, 1995.  The Long-Biased Composite was created September 30, 1999. Performance presented prior to October 1, 2001 occurred while the Portfolio Manager was affiliated with two prior firms and he was the only individual responsible for selecting the securities to buy and sell. ValueWorks was examined in 2007 by an external performance auditor and found to be in compliance with GIPS reporting standards for the period October 1, 2001 through December 31, 2007; the same methods continue to be used in performance presentation.This document does not offer to sell or solicit any offer to buy any securities.  Investments in all of these strategies may lose value. This material is approved for client use.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
