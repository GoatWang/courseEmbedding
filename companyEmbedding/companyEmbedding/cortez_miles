DENVER, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE:    AIV) Chief Administrative Officer Miles Cortez has received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Project Sanctuary for his role in creating a meaningful partnership between the nonprofit and Aimco to strengthen hundreds of military families.  Cortez was honored alongside his Aimco teammates at a recent Project Sanctuary gala which raised funds to provide therapeutic retreats for military families who are reconnecting after their loved ones return from overseas duty.
"As a Vietnam veteran, Miles understands the sacrifices our families experience," said Project Sanctuary Founder and Chief Executive Officer Heather Ehle. "He and the Aimco team have gone far beyond the call of duty to ensure our heroes and their loved ones receive the care they need.  We appreciate Aimco's support and consider the team part of our Project Sanctuary family."
Cortez identified Project Sanctuary as a worthy beneficiary of the annual Aimco Cares Charity Golf Classic five years ago and since that time Aimco's business partners and tournament sponsors nationwide have raised $620,000 to help military families in transition.  In 2016 the tournament's Diamond Sponsors, contributing $30,000 or more, were Affordable Housing Advisors, a division of Marcus & Millichap, and RentPath.  Platinum Sponsors, contributing $20,000 or more, were Apartments.com, ARA Newmark, Realpage, and the law firm of Harris Winick Harris.  Project Sanctuary, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors and college-bound students living in affordable housing will benefit from this year's tournament on August 10 at Sanctuary golf course in Sedalia, CO. 
In addition to helping military families reunite through therapeutic retreats in Colorado's Rocky Mountains and locations across the country, Project Sanctuary assists returning service men and women with housing, job placement and veterans' benefits and tracks participating families for several years.  
"The recognition from Project Sanctuary belongs to all of my Aimco teammates who embrace military causes and step forward to support our soldiers and their families," said Cortez.  "We've had the privilege of meeting so many remarkable men and women who have worn the uniform in service to our country.  We believe strongly in the mission of Project Sanctuary and we are happy to support such a fine organization through financial donations and volunteerism."
Aimco Cares is Aimco's philanthropic program that gives each team member 15 paid hours annually to apply toward a local volunteer activity.  This fall, Aimco Cares will promote efforts across the country to help veterans and their families. 
Aimco is a real estate investment trust that is focused on the ownership and management of quality apartment communities located in the largest markets in the United States. Aimco is one of the country's largest owners and operators of apartments, with 188 communities in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Aimco common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIV, and are included in the S&P 500.
