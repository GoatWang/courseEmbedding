Creation
Expansion
Later Stage




CreationImprivata
From prior to our founding through our IPO, Polaris has been by our side. Every step of the way. Through thick and thin and everything in-between. Their commitment has been crucial to our ability to make difficult, smart, crisp decisions which have enabled us to build critical business value for our customers, important leadership within our industry, a truly-special place for our workforce, and a  valuable company for our shareholders. In our early days, Polaris helped us attract world-class talent at every level of our team, as well as to our Board. They worked their networks and opened up doors to vital business and technology relationships. They understood what it meant to be partners, mentors, constructive critics and central contributors to our strategies to serve a rapidly-transforming healthcare market. Polaris believed in us from the very beginning, applied their operating expertise to our business, and helped us navigate an uncharted course in our journey. They’ve been true partners in every sense of the word.
– Omar Hussain, CEO, Imprivata


 ExpansionCliQr
Choosing Polaris as an investment partner was an easy decision for me and CliQr. The Polaris team is a highly seasoned partnership with tremendous operational background and experience in technology companies and startups. Working with such a team that is known to back strong technology plays and knows what it takes to win in the long term as an entrepreneur was a key factor in our motivation to work with Polaris. Within a short period of time, we have already seen the fruits of this, beyond just the initial investment. Polaris has been instrumental in opening up their network and introducing us to key prospective hires, partners and customers. Above all, the mentoring and coaching I have received to help scale a very rapidly growing company in a very exciting space – cloud –  has been personally invaluable to me.
– Gaurav Manglik, CEO, CliQr

 Later StageStrata Health
We chose Polaris as Strata Health’s partner because they invested in our relationship long before any funding took place.  The two-way dialogue that evolved over the course of three years, coupled with their proven expertise in SaaS healthcare solutions fostered a strong sense of trust, integrity and mutual respect, which is often hard to find in this business. Since the Polaris investment, many new doors have opened for Strata in terms of markets, clients and industry dialogue. The have helped us in many ways including recruiting strong new board members, introducing us to customer prospects, and helping us build out our development team. The Board has become more strategic in driving our business towards key milestones, and the culture of collaboration is accelerating the realization of Strata’s global vision.  Our decision to partner with Polaris was the absolute right one, and the organization and investors will be more successful because of it.
– Don Schick, CEO, Strata Health Solutions

Partnership Stories
We invest throughout the company life cycle – from the earliest creation through profitability – working closely with our teams to help reach their goals.

Creation

Later Stage




CreationVisterra
Polaris has been a visionary partner in the founding and building of Visterra, working with our scientific team on the initial concept in the MIT Labs, forming the company, in-licensing the IP, hiring our first employees and serving as interim leadership in those early days.  The firm has not only been our largest shareholder, but also a great champion, supporting a bold vision, leading our Board of Directors as we achieved each milestone and addressed every opportunity in building a platform that redefines the targeting of infectious disease.  As a result of our partnership, Visterra has a strong investor syndicate that understands our science and our business and a management team that works exceptionally well together in breaking new ground.  At each point where the company was ready to move to the next phase of development, the Polaris team has been there as an anchor, and will continue to be as we seek to help millions of patients worldwide.
– Brian Pereira, CEO, Visterra


 ExpansionReceptos
After raising a successful Series A investment in 2009, we worked closely with Polaris to galvanize our Series B round in 2010-2011, which was a challenging fundraising environment globally. During this time, Polaris came to the table, recognizing the opportunity from both a scientific and business perspective and throwing support behind our team. It was a critical inflection point in our evolution and Polaris was there for us when others were not.   Once on board, as an investor, Polaris was a “thought partner”, subscribing to our collective belief that the essence of strategy is choice.  Together, throughout our growth, we explored many divergent paths before converging on the right one.  This relationship allowed us to assess different options at the board level while supporting the team emotionally, spiritually and strategically.  The result:  Receptos was able to hit or exceed our milestones, and go public at a crucial time while developing important therapies to treat patients with debilitating diseases. Polaris played an important role in this success.
– Faheem Hasnain, President & CEO, Receptos 2010-2015

 Later StageAscend
We were was a single, 104-bed psychiatric hospital looking for an investment partner who believed in our model to deliver specialty behavioral health programs to patients in under-served markets.  Polaris quickly recognized Ascend’s opportunity in the $22 billion mental health arena where demand was outstripping supply.  I chose to partner with them because of their commitment to our innovative services business model.  It was a smart move.  Polaris stepped up quickly at a time when our business was accelerating but the capital markets were challenged.  Our behavioral health platform became validated with recognition of our programs for women, youth, active military affected by combat, and patients with co-occurring disorders. With Polaris as our largest investor, we expanded Ascend’s hospital chain to 5 states; our patient bed count went up more than 8 times; and we generated $200 million in annual revenue and $60 million in profits — all in 4 years.  At the time of our sale to Universal Health Services, Ascend was the largest private psychiatric hospital provider in the country.  Within months of the transaction, I chose Polaris as my lead investor in US Healthvest where we continue to do important work on behalf of psychiatric patients.
– Dr. Richard Kresch, CEO, Ascend & US Healthvest

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
