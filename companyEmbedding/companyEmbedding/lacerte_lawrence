Larry Lacerte loves to buy lottery tickets. Two years ago, in fact, he won $10,000, barely missing out on a big jackpot.Fun but insignificant to a guy who says he’s won much more important lotteries of life — the most valuable being his wife, Joyce, and their seven children. Not to mention that Lacerte, who took only a few college courses, is worth several hundred million dollars.He struck it rich in 1998 when he sold a software company he’d started in his home 20 years before. Intuit Inc. paid $400 million in cash for Lacerte Software Corp. Lacerte’s share was $200 million after taxes.“I was very happy with my tax return that year, and so was the government,” he quips.More recently, Lacerte is beating the odds with one of the worst forms of leukemia, which he’s been battling since February 2010.“Larry is the ultimate optimist,” Joyce says. “He says, ‘If there’s one person with AML [acute myeloid leukemia] who’s going to beat it, it might as well be me.’”Some of you may be wondering why you’ve never heard of him.“This is my first interview ever,” Lacerte says, shifting a bit uncomfortably on a living room couch at his home in Highland Park. “I’ve never wanted to be in the spotlight.”Perhaps you’ve been to the Lacerte Family Children’s Zoo at the Dallas Zoo or read about the sale of the Lacertes’ Park Lane estate, which fetched $30 million two summers ago — the largest price ever paid for a pre-owned Dallas home.But you haven’t read much about Lacerte the businessman.The sale of Lacerte Software in 1998 ran as a one-sentence brief in The Dallas Morning News because Lacerte didn’t release any details.He could have bragged that he negotiated a purchase price that was four times the company’s gross annual sales or pointed out that he and his brother, Phil Lacerte, gave employees $40 million in thank-you bonuses.Recent skirmishes with death have made the 59-year-old reflective. And his latest enterprise has him fired up about the future.“I’m so passionate and excited about what we’re doing at Exponent Technologies,” he says.The company developed a Web-based product that offers interconnected payroll, legal and HR services for small and medium-size businesses. More than 400 companies have signed up for ExponentHR, which Lacerte expects to bring in more than $11 million in sales this year.“I’d really like to see 50 to 100 percent growth year over year for the next several years,” he says. “Anything above that could be too quick. I may be an optimist, but now that we’ve proven ourselves, there’s a snowball effect without doing a lot of marketing and sales presentations.”Lacerte says he’ll be happy when the company is covering 1 million employees and bringing in $150 million to $200 million. “I’m betting that lightning will strike twice.”Larry asked Joyce and her brother, Fidel Baca, Exponent’s chief marketing officer, to sit in on our conversation, fearing chemo brain might cause him to trip up on names and dates.During our three-hour interview, Lacerte nails all the details.KeypunchLawrence John Joseph Lacerte was born the youngest of six kids in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1952. His father moved the family to Florida and started an accounting service bureau. Larry got his first taste of what computers could do as a 12-year-old doing keypunch for his dad.In 1977, Lacerte, who was living in Long Beach, Calif., bought two computers and taught himself programming. Then he created the first desktop application for tax preparation.“I remember Benjamin Franklin saying the only two things you can count on were death and taxes, and I didn’t want to be a mortician,” Lacerte says. “What I loved about the tax business was that it screamed for automation and it had built-in obsolescence.”Lacerte sold the product himself, telling accounting firms that they could buy a computer and software from him, hire someone to operate the system and save thousands of dollars being paid to their service bureaus.“Their first question was: ‘What’s a computer?’” Lacerte laughs.In 1978, Lacerte landed his first customers, Mike Serna and his son, Roger. “They said, ‘Larry, this is incredible. Who else is using it?’ I said, ‘Well, you’d be the first one,’ trying to sound as enthusiastic as I could.”Roger and his dad signed on as guinea pigs because it seemed like the smart thing to do. “Larry was always on the ball and reputable, and it just made sense,” says Roger Serna, who still uses Lacerte products as a tax consultant in Yorba Linda, Calif.Lacerte Tax Software revolutionized the accounting industry. Thirteen years after Intuit bought the business, an estimated one in four professional tax preparers in America still uses Lacerte-branded products.In the midst of building his company, Larry met Joyce.Lacerte usually tells people he didn’t go to college.“When people ask, ‘What university did you go to?’ I could say, ‘I got like 12 credits at Long Beach State.’ But that doesn’t count for much. What does count is I met Joyce, the love of my life, there in 1982.”He was 29; she was 20. They married the next year.By 1989, Larry had 110 employees and decided to move. He found the state’s taxes oppressive and didn’t want to raise his family in Southern California. Joyce was pregnant with baby No. 5.Texas had no corporate or personal income taxes. Dallas was a housing haven with reduced-priced houses for sale everywhere.“Moving us to Dallas converted us from a ‘California’ company to an ‘American’ company that could serve both coasts,” Larry says. “New Yorkers think Californians are nuts. And Californians think New Yorkers are full of themselves. So being in Dallas was a great thing for the company. We tripled the number of employees and produced five times the sales in the next eight years.”Always thinkingLarry went into semi-retirement after the sale to Intuit but still managed his own portfolio.“I made some good investments. I made some bad investments,” he says. “The good news is we’re worth lots of money. The bad news is we’re not worth a lot more.”“Managing all this money can be a full-time job,” Joyce says. “And everybody has a proposal. At his 30th high school class reunion, someone’s sticking a proposal in the car for him to read. But Larry likes to create, and he missed the camaraderie of having a company.”In 2000, Lacerte started thinking about what business needed automation most. “The Internet is this terrific ocean of freedom,” he says. “It doesn’t care whether you log on with an Apple or a Dell or a smartphone. Technology that was out of reach of small and middle-sized businesses is now within reach.”He settled on payroll and human resources because every business has those functions, yet the price of software can be prohibitive. “A lot of small and midsized businesses don’t have the gravy to have a whole HR department and a whole legal department and a whole payroll department,” Lacerte says. “This is turnkey, from timekeeping to taxpaying.”The system is sold as a platform of services on a per-employee basis, Baca says. A business with 50 employees would typically pay about $12,000 a year, while the cost for a company with 500 employees would range from $80,000 to $100,000 annually.Albert Black, chief executive of On-Target Supplies & Logistics in Oak Cliff, which has 158 fulltime employees, signed up as the first customer in 2003.“There hasn’t been one day since we implemented ExponentHR that we haven’t found another jewel that has made us a better company,” says Black, who is also one of Lacerte’s closest friends.“It gives us assurance,” Black says. “If want you to kill a small business in a hurry, just allow it to be out of alignment with the regulatory community — not filing the right taxes in the proper way when you need to file them.”It’s also helped “automate” On-Target’s family culture as it expands into other markets. It allows a free flow of communication and employee surveying at the drop of a hat.“Larry didn’t have to sell us. We had to sell him,” Black says.Lacerte has plenty of money to work with. “I started the first company on a shoestring with me as the employee. With the second company, the sky’s the limit. In some ways, that’s a handicap. The urgency diminishes, as does the need to keep it lean and mean.”The people working for Lacerte are mostly folks from his first company. “A lot of people took cuts in pay to come to be part of what Larry is trying to create with ExponentHR,” says Joyce, an equal partner in the company.Given his weakened immune system, Larry has been running the business mostly from his various homes around the country. “Larry gives people the job and then doesn’t look over their shoulders,” Baca says. “If they have a great idea, they can go to Larry. They don’t have to go through all these layers. It’s very hands-on.“Yet Larry is very much the visionary. You know what he’s trying to accomplish. How it gets done and the details he doesn’t really care about as long as we’re all marching in the same direction.”As Black puts it: “Larry is the kind of man who will climb Mount Everest twice. Most of the time when people climb such a high peak, they don’t do it again. Once is enough. It’s not for Larry.”BACKGROUND: Larry LacerteAge: 59Title: President and chief executive, Exponent Technologies Corp.Born: Vancouver, British Columbia; naturalized U.S. citizen with a penchant for American historyEducation: High school diplomaBusiness background: Started Lacerte Software Corp. in his home in 1978; developed Lacerte Tax Software, the first desktop application for general ledger and tax preparation.

forward- looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such
forward-looking statements could differ materially as a result of, among
other things, the following: timing and delays related to distribution
of an information statement based on the SEC review process,
implementation of internet strategies, integration of technology,
transition of selling and distribution methods, the availability of
capital on terms acceptable to the Company, general economic conditions,
competition, the market for the network software products, software
development costs and possible future litigation, as well as the risks
and uncertainties discussed in the Company's public reports and
filings and public statements.
