  "I have had the pleasure of knowing Ivan for some time, so I am excited        that he will join a very strong 3M leadership team" 



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3M today announced that Ivan Fong will join the company as Senior Vice 
      President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel, effective Oct. 15, 2012. 
      Fong, 51, comes to 3M after serving as General Counsel of the U.S. 
      Department of Homeland Security, where he has been responsible for 
      advising DHS’s senior leadership on all significant legal, policy, and 
      operational issues and leading over 1,800 lawyers.
    

      “I have had the pleasure of knowing Ivan for some time, so I am excited 
      that he will join a very strong 3M leadership team,” said Inge Thulin, 
      3M chairman, president and chief executive officer. “His diverse 
      experience, unmatched qualifications and proven success, along with his 
      winning personal style, make him an ideal addition to 3M.”
    

      Prior to joining DHS in 2009, Fong was the chief legal officer and 
      secretary of Cardinal Health, Inc., a $91 billion global healthcare 
      company, where he was named one of the “Most Influential General 
      Counsel” by the National Law Journal. He was previously senior 
      vice president and general counsel of GE Vendor Financial Services and 
      prior to that was GE’s first chief privacy leader and senior counsel, 
      information technology. Fong has also served as deputy associate 
      attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice; a partner with 
      Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C.; and an adjunct professor at the 
      Georgetown University Law Center. He was a law clerk to Judge Abner J. 
      Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Justice 
      Sandra Day O’Connor of the Supreme Court of the U.S.
    

      Ivan holds a B.C.L. with first-class honors from Oxford University, 
      where he was a Fulbright Scholar. He received his J.D. (with 
      distinction) from Stanford Law School, where he was president of the Stanford 
      Law Review, and an S.B. in chemical engineering and an S.M. in 
      chemical engineering practice from MIT. He is a registered patent 
      attorney.
