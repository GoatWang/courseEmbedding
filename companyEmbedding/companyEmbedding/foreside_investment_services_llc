Lovell Minnick Partners LLC has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Foreside Financial Group LLC. No financial terms were disclosed.

PRESS RELEASE
RADNOR, Pennsylvania – February 7, 2017 – Lovell Minnick Partners, LLC, a private equity firm specializing in financial and related business services companies, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in Foreside Financial Group, LLC (“Foreside”). Foreside provides a variety of regulatory compliance and distribution solutions to clients in the investment management industry. Financial terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.
Established in 2005 and based in Portland, Maine, Foreside has quickly grown to become a U.S. market leader in its space, and enjoys an excellent reputation as a best-in-class service provider across its mix of services. The company is led by Chief Executive Officer Richard Berthy and President Dave Whitaker, who will remain shareholders and continue in their current management roles.
Foreside delivers outsourced services to investment advisers and broker dealers, including the financial products they manage or distribute. Servicing over $800 billion of fund products, Foreside offers outsourced solutions for legal underwriting, FINRA licensing, compliance consulting, fund officer services and trust governance. Demand for Foreside’s services is likely to continue to grow as a result of increasing and costly fund compliance requirements, growing risk management needs, new fund launches, AUM growth and greater cross-border investment activity. 





“Our relationship with Lovell Minnick goes back many years, and we share a strategic vision to achieve greater scale in our core distribution and compliance services for investment managers and their funds, both in the U.S. and offshore markets,” said Berthy. “Lovell Minnick has an excellent track record of partnering with financial services firms in the investment management industry, and their capital and strategic insight will help us grow our client base and offerings while ensuring that we continue to deliver first class service.”
Lovell Minnick believes the market opportunity for outsourced fund and compliance services is compelling. The firm holds ownership stakes in several of Foreside’s existing clients, including 361 Capital, Chartwell Investment Partners, and Matthews International Capital Management.
“As one of the most respected outsourced service providers in the asset management industry, Foreside is uniquely positioned to help clients navigate the changing financial and regulatory landscape,” said Spencer Hoffman, a Partner at Lovell Minnick. “We look forward to working closely with Rich, Dave and the rest of Foreside’s strong management team as they execute their strategy to grow the business and to further broaden the scope of services they provide.”
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory reviews and approvals. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP served as legal counsel to Lovell Minnick Partners.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
