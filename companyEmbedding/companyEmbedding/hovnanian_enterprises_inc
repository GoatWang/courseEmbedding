Such risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, (1) changes in general and local economic, industry and business conditions and impacts of the sustained homebuilding downturn; (2) adverse weather and other environmental conditions and natural disasters; (3) levels of indebtedness and restrictions on the Company’s operations and activities imposed by the agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness; (4) the Company's sources of liquidity; (5) changes in credit ratings; (6) changes in market conditions and seasonality of the Company’s business; (7) the availability and cost of suitable land and improved lots; (8) shortages in, and price fluctuations of, raw materials and labor; (9) regional and local economic factors, including dependency on certain sectors of the economy, and employment levels affecting home prices and sales activity in the markets where the Company builds homes; (10) fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing; (11) changes in tax laws affecting the after-tax costs of owning a home; (12) operations through joint ventures with third parties; (13) government regulation, including regulations concerning development of land, the home building, sales and customer financing processes, tax laws and the environment; (14) product liability litigation, warranty claims and claims made by mortgage investors; (15) levels of competition; (16) availability and terms of financing to the Company; (17) successful identification and integration of acquisitions; (18) significant influence of the Company’s controlling stockholders; (19) availability of net operating loss carryforwards; (20) utility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations; (21) geopolitical risks, terrorist acts and other acts of war; (22) increases in cancellations of agreements of sale; (23) loss of key management personnel or failure to attract qualified personnel; (24) information technology failures and data security breaches; (25) legal claims brought against us and not resolved in our favor; and (26) certain risks, uncertainties and other factors described in detail in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.

Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. is a United States real estate company which is involved in every aspect of marketing homes, including design, construction and sales. The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services, and recently entered the Fortune 500.
Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, as of September 2009.[2]

Company operations[edit]
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. has delivered in excess of 312,000 houses since incorporation including 5,934 homes in fiscal 2014,[1] with base prices ranging from $46,000 to $2,350,000 and averaging about $280,000. It operates in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington DC, and West Virginia.[3] Members of the Hovnanian family, including Ara K. Hovnanian, have voting control over approximately 56% of the votes as of October 31, 2014 equivalent to a stake worth $178 million in 2015.[1]
The company relocated its corporate headquarters to a new building on the banks of the Navesink River in Red Bank, New Jersey, in 2006.[2]
History[edit]
In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers - Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovananian - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey.[4]
Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families.[4] A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers.[4] In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization."[4]
In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.[5] Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.[4]
Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.[4] An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities.[4] It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.[2]
Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian.[4] He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian.[4] However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009.[4]
Ara Hovnanian is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and led the company through 19 acquisitions of smaller builders from 1999 through the early stages of the housing crisis. The company relied heavily on debt to fund the acquisitions. However, falling property prices has forced the company to write off more than $2.6 billion of its value since 2006. As of October 2015, the company's debt load is $2.1 billion and interest payments amount to $35 million to $40 million per quarter.[6]
Quality[edit]
Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored.[7]
K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
K. Hovnanian Homes has also been the subject of praise from homeowners citing the builders reputation and solid history.[8] Hovnanian has also received numerous awards based on the quality of their construction and high level customer support.[9][10]

Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. is a United States real estate company which is involved in every aspect of marketing homes, including design, construction and sales. The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services, and recently entered the Fortune 500.
Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, as of September 2009.[2]

Company operations[edit]
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. has delivered in excess of 312,000 houses since incorporation including 5,934 homes in fiscal 2014,[1] with base prices ranging from $46,000 to $2,350,000 and averaging about $280,000. It operates in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington DC, and West Virginia.[3] Members of the Hovnanian family, including Ara K. Hovnanian, have voting control over approximately 56% of the votes as of October 31, 2014 equivalent to a stake worth $178 million in 2015.[1]
The company relocated its corporate headquarters to a new building on the banks of the Navesink River in Red Bank, New Jersey, in 2006.[2]
History[edit]
In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers - Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovananian - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey.[4]
Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families.[4] A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers.[4] In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization."[4]
In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.[5] Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.[4]
Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.[4] An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities.[4] It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.[2]
Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian.[4] He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian.[4] However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009.[4]
Ara Hovnanian is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and led the company through 19 acquisitions of smaller builders from 1999 through the early stages of the housing crisis. The company relied heavily on debt to fund the acquisitions. However, falling property prices has forced the company to write off more than $2.6 billion of its value since 2006. As of October 2015, the company's debt load is $2.1 billion and interest payments amount to $35 million to $40 million per quarter.[6]
Quality[edit]
Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored.[7]
K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company.

K. Hovnanian Homes has also been the subject of praise from homeowners citing the builders reputation and solid history.[8] Hovnanian has also received numerous awards based on the quality of their construction and high level customer support.[9][10]

Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. is a United States real estate company which is involved in every aspect of marketing homes, including design, construction and sales. The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services, and recently entered the Fortune 500.
Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, as of September 2009.[2]

Company operations[edit]
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. has delivered in excess of 312,000 houses since incorporation including 5,934 homes in fiscal 2014,[1] with base prices ranging from $46,000 to $2,350,000 and averaging about $280,000. It operates in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington DC, and West Virginia.[3] Members of the Hovnanian family, including Ara K. Hovnanian, have voting control over approximately 56% of the votes as of October 31, 2014 equivalent to a stake worth $178 million in 2015.[1]
The company relocated its corporate headquarters to a new building on the banks of the Navesink River in Red Bank, New Jersey, in 2006.[2]
History[edit]
In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers - Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovananian - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey.[4]
Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families.[4] A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers.[4] In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization."[4]
In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.[5] Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.[4]
Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.[4] An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities.[4] It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.[2]
Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian.[4] He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian.[4] However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009.[4]
Ara Hovnanian is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and led the company through 19 acquisitions of smaller builders from 1999 through the early stages of the housing crisis. The company relied heavily on debt to fund the acquisitions. However, falling property prices has forced the company to write off more than $2.6 billion of its value since 2006. As of October 2015, the company's debt load is $2.1 billion and interest payments amount to $35 million to $40 million per quarter.[6]
Quality[edit]
Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored.[7]
K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
K. Hovnanian Homes has also been the subject of praise from homeowners citing the builders reputation and solid history.[8] Hovnanian has also received numerous awards based on the quality of their construction and high level customer support.[9][10]

Although we were greatly saddened by his passing in 2009, his dream inspires us every day, and his integrity and legacy continue to guide us as we come together to build homes and communities for each and every family who puts their trust in us. It is a privilege to share our story with you.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Homes Crafted With A
Legacy of Quality


The Name Behind the Dream®

In 1959 our Founder, Kevork S. Hovnanian (pictured with his son, Ara), came to a new land with a dream: to build a home for his family, and for all families seeking a better life. Although we were greatly saddened by his passing in 2009, his dream inspires us every day, and his integrity and legacy continue to guide us as we come together to build homes and communities for each and every family who puts their trust in us. It is a privilege to share our story with you.

A Message
From our CEO

I'm Ara Hovnanian, CEO and Chairman of Hovnanian Enterprises®, Inc. Thank you for your interest in our new homes and communities. I am delighted you are considering K. Hovnanian® Homes to be the builder of your new home. Having grown up in the business my father started back in 1959, I spent my summers in our communities, sweeping out houses and learning about construction, land development and other fascinating aspects of the business.  I guess you could say that homebuilding is "in my blood." The strength of a home is its foundation. The strength of our Company is our people. It would be my Company's honor to build your new home for you.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  26.69 (07/28/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.09      Market Cap $339.70 M     Shares Outstanding 132.12 M     Public Float 118.20 M     Yield HOV has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.50      Net Money Flow ($)  -333,201    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. is a United States real estate company which is involved in every aspect of marketing homes, including design, construction and sales. The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services, and recently entered the Fortune 500.
Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, as of September 2009.[2]

In 1959, Kevork Hovnanian, an ethnic Armenian originally from Iraq, and his three brothers - Hirair Hovnanian, Jirair Hovnanian and Vahak Hovananian - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed, to found Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. in a trailer in Toms River, New Jersey.[4]
Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost condos and townhouses, many to first time young homeowners and families.[4] A typical two-bedroom, two bathroom Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated amenities such as communal swimming pools, which other builders used to attract potential buyers.[4] In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited recreation facilities going in because people have little time for socialization."[4]
In 1964 Jirair Hovnanian split off from his brothers' company and founded his own construction business, J.S. Hovnanian & Sons, of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey.[5] Hirair and Vahak also left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.[4]
Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.[4] An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include luxury homes, mid-priced homes and retirement communities.[4] It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.[2]
Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, Ara K. Hovnanian.[4] He remained chief executive until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian.[4] However, he remained the chairman of the company's board of directors until his death in 2009.[4]
Ara Hovnanian is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School and led the company through 19 acquisitions of smaller builders from 1999 through the early stages of the housing crisis. The company relied heavily on debt to fund the acquisitions. However, falling property prices has forced the company to write off more than $2.6 billion of its value since 2006. As of October 2015, the company's debt load is $2.1 billion and interest payments amount to $35 million to $40 million per quarter.[6]
Quality[edit]
Hovnanian has been the subject of customer complaints. In a few cases, there have been legitimate construction problems in some Hovnanian houses. For example, in 2005, Hovnanian acknowledged problems in a development in New Jersey after nearly three dozen disgruntled homeowners turned to elected officials when their complaints were ignored.[7]
K. Hovnanian the home builder and the mortgage company are no strangers to controversy. In 2008, the home builder was involved in a class action lawsuit where the plaintiffs alleged their subdivision was built near an old bombing range. The company settled the lawsuit in 2011 for a reported $1.2 million. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
The mortgage company was involved in a class action lawsuit filed in 2007 alleging violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) for removing incentives from home buyers if they opted to use another title insurance provider rather than the Hovnanian-affiliated title insurance company. (source: http://themortgageinsider.net/mortgage-reviews/k-hovnanian-american-mortgage-review.html).
K. Hovnanian Homes has also been the subject of praise from homeowners citing the builders reputation and solid history.[8] Hovnanian has also received numerous awards based on the quality of their construction and high level customer support.[9][10]

Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. is a United States real estate company which is involved in every aspect of marketing homes, including design, construction and sales. The company works with individual detached housing as well as higher-occupancy dwellings, including townhouses, condominiums and retirement homes. In most cases, the company acquires and develops the land on which these developments are built, but in some geographic regions, Hovnanian offers to build their proprietary house designs on private land. The company consists of two operating groups, homebuilding and financial services, and recently entered the Fortune 500.
Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008–2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in New Jersey, as of September 2009.[2]
