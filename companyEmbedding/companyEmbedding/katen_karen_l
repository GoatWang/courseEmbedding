      ■ Karen L. Katen was executive vice president of Pfizer as well as
      president of Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals, the company's principal
      operating division, and held a seat on the company's board of
      directors. After joining Pfizer in 1974, Katen was involved in the
      marketing of virtually every major drug launched by the company. Her group
      produced eight of the world's top 25 pharmaceutical products,
      including the world's top seller Lipitor, with annual sales
      approaching $10 billion. Described as one of Pfizer's most
      respected leaders, Katen was known for disseminating knowledge throughout
      the organization, building strong cross-functional teams, and championing
      collaboration.
    

      COLLEGE AND EARLY PROFESSIONAL DIRECTION
    

      A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Karen Katen attended the University of
      Chicago, where she graduated in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in
      political science. Katen landed a job in

      sales at an office supply company shortly after graduation. After one year
      on the job, she returned to the University of Chicago and earned her MBA
      in 1974.
    


        A FOCUSED CAREER
      


      Katen joined Pfizer in 1974 as a marketing associate in the Roerig
      Division. From the beginning she found a perfect fit for herself in
      marketing and management, eventually holding several management posts
      within the U.S. Pharmaceutical Division, including vice president of
      marketing in 1983, vice president and director of operations in 1986, and
      vice president and general manager in 1991. She was named executive vice
      president of the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group in 1993. By 1995 she was
      promoted again, to president of Pfizer U.S. Pharmaceuticals. In 2001 Katen
      assumed responsibility for
       global business in more than 90 countries as president of Pfizer Global
      Pharmaceuticals. Katen's roles entailed direct management of
      worldwide medical and regulatory activities and the worldwide development
      of pharmaceutical products. She was also a member of the prestigious
      Pfizer Leadership Team.
    

      A SOLID RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT
    

      Throughout her career at Pfizer, Katen developed and implemented several
      core strategies that, though considered givens by today's
      management thinkers, were nevertheless in their time quite innovative.
      While most industry executives maintained that their companies'
      products were prescription medicines, Katen reframed the conceptual model
      in asserting that pharmaceuticals was essentially a knowledge business
      grounded in intellectual capital. Fundamentally, she told Molly Rose Teuke
      of 
      
        Chief Executive
      
      , "what we do is transfer scientific knowledge to physicians, and
      increasingly to patients, their families, and their communities"
      (July 2001).
    

      This distinction became central in her drive to distribute knowledge
      throughout Pfizer's many internal functions—functions which
      were often encapsulated by silo mentalities at other companies. Indeed, as
      noted by Teuke, Katen was known to have a paperweight on her desk with the
      inscription, "Who else needs to know?" (July 2001)—a
      question alluding to the ongoing need to share information. Katen
      asserted, "Knowledge is a company asset, not the property of any
      individual, and that's our greatest strength" (July 2001).
      At a time when many senior executives saw the dissemination of knowledge
      as a threat to their corporate fiefdoms, Katen applied the principle of
      knowledge dissemination relentlessly, thus propelling Pfizer to become a
      marketing powerhouse.
    

      Her philosophy was evident in Pfizer's "Share Fairs."
      At Pfizer meetings employees displayed "good practice"
      posters, enabling colleagues to learn about the latest best practices.
      Whoever wanted to implement a new concept could borrow the poster in
      question on the condition that they share a "good practice"
      of their own. All of a meeting's participants could take two
      posters and display two posters of their own, ensuring the dynamic
      dissemination of knowledge.
    

      Katen noticed that the delivery of pharmaceuticals, as part of the
      delivery of health care in general, was an inherently local enterprise. As
      such global companies like Pfizer needed to adapt their messages to
      consumers in ways that suited local cultural and demographic conditions.
      Here too Katen fostered an environment of local empowerment. By the
      mid-1990s, breaking a long-standing tradition of launching products one
      market at a time over the course of a decade, under Katen's
      leadership Pfizer localized product launches so that any given product was
      distributed throughout 75 markets within 24 months.
    

      During her tenure at Pfizer, Katen's achievements fell into three
      general categories: blockbusters, partnerships, and the sales force. In
      terms of blockbusters, during the 1990s Katen helped launch 10 innovative
      pharmaceuticals produced by Pfizer's research and development
      program, including Viagra, for erectile dysfunction; Lipitor, to lower
      cholesterol; Zyrtec, an allergy medicine; Zoloft, for depression;
      Celebrex, for arthritis pain; Norvasc, for hypertension; and the leading
      antibiotic Zithromax. With respect to partnerships, before Pfizer's
      2000 acquisition of the company, in 1997 Katen engineered a lucrative
      co-marketing deal with Warner-Lambert to help market its
      cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor, which became the number-one
      lipid-lowering agent in the United States by 2004. Finally, Katen oversaw
      the addition of 750 representatives to Pfizer's sales force, which
      was one of the most respected in the industry.
    

      With two key acquisitions in the early 2000s—Warner-Lambert in 2000
      and Pharmacia in 2003—Katen managed the largest integrations in the
      history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. As a result of both internal
      growth and these acquisitions, revenues for the Global Pharmaceuticals
      group reached $45 billion in 2003—nine times greater than 1993
      revenues.
    

      MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND LEADERSHIP STYLE
    

      Katen's management style was the very antithesis of the classic
      top-down, authoritarian approach; she was well known for her ability to
      build cohesive teams within a highly competitive company. She assembled
      cross-functional groups to launch products, a strategy that proved very
      successful as team members worked together for the full
      period—often 10 to 12 years—during which a product was
      undergoing clinical trial and awaiting regulatory approval. She encouraged
      open communication among individuals from various functions, including
      scientists, physicians, salespeople, and marketers, both before and after
      Food and Drug Administration product approval. The resulting sense for the
      need to communicate openly filtered down throughout the organization,
      permitting cross-functional team members to address issues quickly.
    

      Katen was known for fully developing the people working under her. Peter
      Brandt, the senior vice president for finance, planning, and business
      development at the Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group, told John Slania of the
      University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, "Karen truly
      believes in and cares about her people. She realizes the importance of
      developing people and she does that by pushing them—keeping their
      feet to the fire—and also by providing them with the resources and
      support to get the job done" (March 2004).
    

      Dr. Joseph Feczko, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Group's senior vice
      president for medical and regulatory operations, offered Slania this
      perspective: "She relies very heavily on the experience and
      technical knowledge of the physicians in her group, but she's not
      intimidated. While she's a bottom-line type of
       person, she brings a human face to the business. She's interested
      in doing the right thing, even if it's not supportive of the bottom
      line" (March 2004). This attitude was evident when Katen supported
      the Pfizer CEO Dr. Henry A. McKinnell's initiative to provide
      Pfizer's antifungal drug Diflucan to AIDS patients in Africa free
      of charge.
    

      A SOARING REPUTATION
    

      Katen was one of the most highly respected women in the pharmaceutical
      industry, managing a larger business unit than any other female manager in
      the industry. Her stature was evident from her membership in the
      industry's leading organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and
      Manufacturers Association of America, as well as a member of the boards of
      directors for General Motors, the Harris Corporation, and the RAND
      Corporation and was a trustee of the University of Chicago and a council
      member of its Graduate School of Business. She served on the boards of
      directors of several health and community organizations.
