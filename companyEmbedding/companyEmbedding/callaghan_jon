Jon Callaghan 





 



Jon is an early stage venture capitalist and a founder of True Ventures. Jon has founded three of his own companies and has been in the venture capital business since 1991. Jon founded his first company, Mountain Bike Outfitters, Inc in 1986. He started his venture career as an associate at Summit Partners and then joined AOL’s Greenhouse, the venture capital/incubator for AOL. Jon joined the internet market early by joining CMGi’s @Ventures group in 1996. Before founding True, Jon was a Managing Director at Globespan Capital.
First as founder and now as investor, Jon’s direct startup experience means that he has seen the world through an entrepreneur’s eyes, making him a confidant and therefore priceless resource for the startups in which he invests. Jon received a BA in Government from Dartmouth College and an MBA, with distinction, from Harvard Business School.  When he is not empowering the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, you can probably find him talking about airplanes or playing with his children.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Consumer electronics company Jawbone had more than enough money to take on Fitbit (FIT) and other health-tracking devices in the "wearables" market. That may have ended up being its biggest problem.
