Performance Additives





Diesel		
								We offer both On & Off-Road Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel.


Developed to allow the use of improved pollution control devices that reduce diesel emissions more effectively but can be damaged by sulfur, ULSD is a cleaner burning diesel fuel that contains 97% less sulfur than low-sulfur diesel. Companies with 2007 or later model year diesel vehicles should only fuel them with ULSD. ULSD has a maximum sulfur content of 15 parts per million (ppm).


For detailed info & specs, download the following: 									
ULSD On Road
ULSD Off Road

Gasoline		
								We offer Reformulated Unleaded Gasoline in 87, 89, and 93 octane, reformulated to maintain specified engine performance. Reformulated Gasoline contains an advanced, multi-functional additive system at a concentration higher than the legal requirement. All Warren Oil gasolines meet or exceed ASTM D 4814 Standard Specification for gasoline and all applicable Federal and State regulations.


For detailed info & specs, download the following: 									
Regular Unleaded (87)
Premium Unleaded (93)

ORDER NOW!



E-85 / Flex Fuel		
								Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) are designed to run on gasoline or a blend of up to 85% ethanol (E85). Except for a few engine and fuel system modifications, they are identical to gasoline-only models. FFVs experience no loss in performance when operating on E85. However, since ethanol contains less energy per volume than gasoline, FFVs typically get about 25-30% fewer miles per gallon when fueled with E85.

*Check with your fuel system and fuel container manufacturers for compatibility with ethanol and E85 blends.


For detailed info & specs, download the following: 									
E-85



 

ORDER NOW!



Biodiesel		
								Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant greases. It is safe, biodegradable, and produces less air pollutants than petroleum-based diesel. Biodiesel can be used in its pure form (B100) or blended with petroleum diesel. Al Warren Oil Company offers all available blends.

For students who expect to become involved in programs that are concerned with the development, management and protection of water resources.
The Fifth Edition of Introduction to Hydrology has been redesigned to better acquaint future water engineers, scientists and managers with the basic elements of the hydrologic cycle. Its focus is on presenting the principles of hydrology in the context of their application to real-world problems. The book identifies data sources, introduces statistical analyses in the context of hydrologic problem-solving, covers the components of the hydrologic budget, discusses hydrograph analysis and routing, and introduces groundwater hydrology, urban hydrology, hydrologic models and hydrologic design. Many solved examples and problems serve to amplify the concepts presented in the text. Computer applications are discussed and appropriate Web addresses are provided.
