Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

OverviewProductsProduct DeliveryStakeholder Updates

Overview

Overview
U.S. Silica's Berkeley Springs plant has been mining the Oriskany deposit along the Warm Springs Ridge for over 100 years. The sand here is a 99.9% pure, buff-white sandstone that is low in iron, making it perfect for flat glass, specialty glass, building products, ceramics, paint, fillers, extenders, pool filtration and recreational use.
History
Mining at this location has been a part of the local landscape for over a century. The Pennsylvania Glass Sand Company, from Lewistown, PA, came into the area in the late 1800s and acquired much of the land − originally mined by many small family owned companies − and began what was then known as Berkeley Works. U.S. Silica, as it is known today, has undergone many developments over the years and has been a thriving part of the community, employing multiple generations of families from Berkeley Springs and the surrounding area.
Community
Many of the Berkeley Springs employees strive to be good neighbors and dedicate their free time to local fire and rescue organizations, youth leadership positions such as coaching and scouts, and to community needs like food drives. The plant also participates in an annual "adoption" of a needy family at Christmas and donates sand products for local recreational use. Recently the Berkeley Springs facility was honored with the 2009 Mountaineer Guardian Award for the effectiveness of the company's safety program.

U.S. Silica's facilities, strategically located in 13 states and globally in China, are situated on or near the best available mineral resources for that geographical region.  Each plant has been equipped with the right processing equipment, quality systems and shipping capabilities necessary to supply our valued customers and innovative thinking.
Employees at these locations work hard to integrate the environmental stewardship, social responsibility and economic prosperity that are necessary to ensure the long-term supply of quality minerals to our customers. For example:

Berkeley Springs facility was honored with the 2009 Mountaineer Guardian Award for the effectiveness of the company’s safety program
Columbia received the National Association of State Land Reclamationists (NASLR) National Mined Land Reclamation Award
Mapleton’s charitable group, known as the Sandbaggers, organized a "Relay for Life" team that has achieved Gold Level for being a top-producing fundraising team in the fight against cancer
Ottawa has contracted with "Pheasants Forever," a nonprofit conservation organization, in an effort to perpetuate the preservation of the upland wildlife on the facility’s property

These are just a few of the accomplishments that go above and beyond the call of duty – in every location, employees volunteer in the community, makes charitable donations, and works actively to preserve environmental resources.
