Forward Looking Statements Disclosure 
 
This Form C-AR and any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this Form C-AR are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Company´s current reasonable expectations and projections relating to its financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intended,” “believe,” “may,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” and any other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.
 
The forward-looking statements contained in this Form C-AR and any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein are based on reasonable assumptions the Company has made in light of its industry experience, perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this Form C-AR, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (many of which are beyond the Company´s control) and assumptions. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect its actual operating and financial performance and cause its performance to differ materially from the performance anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove incorrect or change, the Company´s actual operating and financial performance may vary in material respects from the performance projected in these forward-looking statements.
 
Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this Form C-AR or any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein speaks only as of the date of this Form C-AR. Factors or events that could cause our actual operating and financial performance to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Business Description
 
The Company is a software company developing a smartphone application for creating realistic avatars of people for virtual reality and games. The Company believes the future of VR/AR and gaming goes beyond individual experiences, making VR/AR the most social computing platform yet. To make virtual experiences truly social, every person needs a unique 3D avatar that represents him or her in virtual worlds. The Company seeks to engage people in games and VR by building a smartphone-based avatar creation app that anyone can use. The Company’s solution enables a person to 3D scan his or her face by using a smartphone frontal camera. The application creates detailed face geometry and texture based on a 20 second scan, where a person has to hold the phone stationary in front of his/her face while turning his/her head to right and left as per instructions given during capture. The Company is working with industry recognized game studios, training simulation studios, virtual reality arcades and independent developers in the virtual reality and gaming market. In addition, the Company is offering solutions to businesses who seek to offer extra value to their customers through personalized experience.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold valid European design patents on apparatus for recording 3D images.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There are no pending legal proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition and, to our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened.
 
Previous Offerings of Securities
 
On October 3, 2016, the Company commenced side-by-side offerings of an aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes (the Crowd Notes) of $1,000,000 pursuant to Regulation CF and an aggregate principal amount of Crowd Notes of $500,000 pursuant to Regulation D. In 2017, in a series of closing, the last of which occurred on April 6, 2017, the Company raised gross proceeds of $604,640 and issued an aggregate principal amount of Crowd Notes of $164,700 to investors pursuant to the Regulation CF offering, an aggregate principal amount of Crowd Notes of $439,940 to investors pursuant to the Regulation D offering and an aggregate principal amount of Crowd Notes of $29,857 to SI Securities LLC, as non-cash compensation for acting as exclusive placement agent and intermediary in connection with the Company’s Regulation CF offering and Regulation D offering. The Company also paid SI Securities LLC a cash placement fee in the aggregate amount of $30,344.50. The Crowd Notes issued pursuant to the Regulation CF offering and the Regulation D offering are substantially similar. However, the Crowd Notes issued pursuant to the Regulation D offering and to SI Securities LLC accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, while the Crowd Notes issued pursuant to the Regulation CF offering accrue no interest. In the case of the Crowd Notes issued pursuant to Regulation CF, upon the closing of a qualified equity financing, which is defined as the first sale by the Company of preferred stock in which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than $1 million, such Crowd Notes will convert into shares of the Company’s preferred stock at the earlier of (i) the Company’s election or (ii) the occurrence of a corporate transaction. In the case of the Crowd Notes issued pursuant to Regulation D, upon the occurrence of a qualified equity financing, the Crowd Notes, together with accrued interest thereon, will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s preferred stock.
  
The price at which the Crowd Notes issued by the Company pursuant to Regulation CF and Regulation D will convert into shares of preferred stock upon the occurrence of a qualified equity financing equals the lesser of: A) 20% less than the price per share paid by the investors purchasing preferred stock in the qualified equity financing and B) a price per share equal to $4,500,000 divided by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. In the event of a corporate transaction, if it occurs prior to a qualified equity financing or if the value of the converted shares that the investor would receive is less than twice the amount the investor invested, the investor will receive a payment equal to twice the amount of its initial investment in lieu of the converted shares.

The net proceeds received by the Company from the offerings pursuant to Regulation CF and Regulation D were $564,588.40. Such net proceeds are being used primarily to fund development of the Company’s technology.
 
Although the Company does not currently have any specific plans to offer additional securities, the Company anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of securities in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2017.
 
Related Party Transactions 
 
As of December 31, 2016, Wolfprint 3D OÜ was obligated to pay AS Estonian Business School, a stockholder of the Company, the principal amount of $129,790 plus interest under the terms of a loan agreement dated May 23, 2014 between Wolfprint 3D OÜ and AS Estonian Business School. Such loan accrues interest at an annual rate of 12%, is secured by the fixed assets of Wolfprint 3D OÜ and is required to be repaid before repayment of any other loans made to Wolfprint 3D OÜ. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of interest outstanding under the loan was $23,120. The loan was used to finance past and current development and research projects. Pursuant to an amendment to the loan, the maturity date of the loan was extended to December 31, 2017. AS Estonian Business School Group has the right to convert, at a discounted rate, $54,000 of the outstanding loan amount into certain financings undertaken by Wolfprint 3D OÜ, provided that the gross proceeds from any such financing equal at least $217,428. 
 
On December 29, 2016, Wolfprint 3D OÜ entered into a 3-week loan agreement with Healthcare Solutions OÜ, a stockholder of the Company, pursuant to which Healthcare Solutions OÜ loaned Wolfprint 3D OÜ the principal amount of $18,466. The loan bears interest at a rate of 2% per annum. This loan was one of a series of loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016. All of the other loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016 were repaid or rolled into the loan made on December 29, 2016. The December 29, 2016 loan is secured by the accounts receivable of Wolfprint 3D OÜ. As of December 31, 2016, total outstanding interest on the December 29, 2016 loan was $222. On January 20, 2017, Wolfprint 3D OÜ repaid the principal amount of the December 29, 2016 loan together with accrued interest thereon of $245.62.
 
Stockholders of the Company have advanced funds to the Company or Wolfprint 3D OÜ in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2016, the balance due to the stockholders under this arrangement was $295. These advances bear no interest and are considered payable on demand.
 
RISK FACTORS
 
We have no history in the United States and have not generated any revenues
 
We have relocated from Estonia and have not yet commenced our planned principal operations in the United States nor generated any revenue. Our activities in the United States since the Company’s incorporation in Delaware in August 2016 have consisted of formation activities and the raising of capital through the issuance of the Crowd Notes. Once we commence our planned principal operations in the United States we will incur significant additional expenses. We are dependent upon additional capital resources for the commencement of our planned principal operations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure funding to operationalize our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business.

The company’s financial statements include a “going concern” note.
 
Even if we are able to successfully begin operations in the United States, we may not have enough funds to sustain the business until it becomes profitable. We may not accurately anticipate how quickly we may use funds available and if such funds are sufficient to make any profits at all.
 
We operate in a new market in which we are trying to establish and respond to demand that does not yet exist.
 
While the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) markets have a lot of promise, there is no guarantee that consumer adoption of VR and AR products and services will be as swift and large scale as predicted. If we are not able to create a big enough market for our products and services, we may not be able to keep the Company afloat. Slow consumer adoption of tools and services similar to ours may negatively impact our business.
 
Does anyone want our product and will they pay enough for it?
 
We will only succeed if we establish a stable client base including collaborations with large companies active in our markets. Slow adoption by partners would mean that we would not be able to generate enough revenue from collaborating with them. We do not currently know if and when private individuals will be willing to pay for our services.
 
We may not be able to develop and protect technology in accordance with our plans.
 
Our plans to further develop our virtual and augmented reality technologies may not be as successful as we hope. We may spend a lot of time and money designing the technology only to find out it does not work. Even if we successfully develop any technology we may not be able to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for it, which would make it less valuable.
 
We may not be able to get patent and other intellectual property protection for our technology in the United States.
 
While we currently hold valid European design patents on apparatus for recording 3D images, there is no guarantee that the US Patent Office will approve any patent application we may file in a timely manner. This could reduce the value of our products and services.
 
We are not going to make any profits for at least three years.
 
We have never had any significant revenues and no profits are projected for the next three years at the very least. There is no guarantee we will have any profits after three years or ever.
 


 

5


 

 
 
We have a small management team with no US market experience.
 
We depend on the skills and experience of a small management team. Our management team consists of non-US individuals who have no previous experience with US markets. The Company needs to hire additional employees and personnel to successfully scale up. In particular, we will need to hire people with sales and marketing expertise in the United States. Our ability to raise sufficient capital may have an impact on our ability to attract and hire the right talent.
 
We may not be able to obtain appropriate immigration status for members of our management team or employees or other personnel going forward.
 
The process of moving our main operations to the United States may not go as smoothly as we hope if we encounter immigration law related issues. Our management team and future employees who are non-US citizens will need appropriate authorization from the United States federal government to work in the United States if formally employed and paid by the Company. There is no guarantee this will happen as quickly as we hope and in accordance with our needs.
 
We will need more people to join our Company.
 
We will need to engage additional engineers and people with the skills necessary to ensure we create and sell a premium product. The people we bring on should come with specialized skills that will bring value to the Company. There are no guarantees that we will be able to find the right people for the job.
 
The Company is going to need more money.
 
We will probably need to raise more funds in the future and if we do not raise them we will fail. Even if we do raise additional capital in the future, the terms of the issuance of such securities might result in previous investments in the Company being worthless because later investors might receive more favorable terms.
 
We depend on the success of various ongoing discussions with companies able to successfully integrate our products and pay for them.
 
In order to be successful, we have to sign cooperation sales and licensing agreements with various large companies operating in the gaming and VR/AR space. These are the companies that have the resources to pay for our products and services on a scale to make our business viable. While we have received substantial interest from many of these companies, there is no guarantee that we will be able to finalize enough of these agreements in time to keep the Company going.
 
We have a number of competitors more established than we are.
 
There are other companies providing services similar to ours. Some of these companies are large established companies with resources far superior to ours. Accordingly, they may be able to develop technologies better than ours and may succeed in convincing clients to adopt them faster.

Although dependent on certain key personnel, the Company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people.
 
The Company is dependent on Timmu Tõke in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan. However, the Company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to him in the event of his death or disability. Therefore, if Timmu Tõke dies or becomes disabled, the Company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person´s absence. The loss of such person could negatively affect the Company and its operations.
 
We are not subject to Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required of public companies.
 
We do not have the internal infrastructure necessary, and are not required, to complete an attestation about our financial controls that would be required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There can be no assurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls. We expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management´s time if and when it becomes necessary to perform the system and process evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements.
 
We have not prepared any audited financial statements.
 
Therefore, you have no audited financial information regarding the Company´s capitalization or assets or liabilities.
 
The Company´s success depends on the experience and skill of the sole member of its board of directors, its executive officers and key employees.
 
The Company is dependent on Timmu Tõke, Haver Järveoja, Kaspar Tiri and Rainer Selvet. The loss of them could harm the Company´s business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations.
 
REGULATORY INFORMATION
 
The company has not previously failed to comply with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding.

The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary significantly, and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of progress of our development efforts, actual needs with respect to product testing, research and development, market conditions, and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies, as well as any legal or regulatory changes which may ensue. 
 
If management is unable to implement our proposed business plan or employ alternative financing strategies, it does not presently have any alternative proposals. We cannot assure you that our technology will be accepted in the marketplace, that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations or that we will ever be profitable. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.

WOLFPRINT 3D INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
As of December 31, 2016 and for the period then ended
 
NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS
 
Wolfprint 3D Inc. (“Company”) is a corporation formed on August 18, 2016 under the laws of Delaware. The Company provides products and services related to 3D modeling and 3D scanning.
 
On September 16, 2016, the stockholders owning 100% of the capital stock of Wolfprint 3D OÜ, an Estonian limited company (the “Subsidiary”), entered into an agreement with the Company pursuant to which such stockholders exchanged all of their shares of capital stock of Wolfprint 3D OÜ for an aggregate of 10,870 shares of the common stock of the Company. As a result of this exchange, Wolfprint 3D OÜ became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Company prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each entity and are presented on a consolidated basis. All transactions and balances between the Company and Subsidiary have been eliminated in consolidating the accounts for consolidated financial statement preparation. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, transactions between entities under common control are retroactively applied, and accordingly, the Company’s and the Subsidiary’s financial activity has been included as of December 31, 2016 and for the period from the Company’s inception date to December 31, 2016.
 
The Company adopted the calendar year as its basis of reporting.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Risks and Uncertainties
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has not commenced full scale planned principal operations nor generated significant operating revenue. The Company’s activities since inception have consisted of formation activities, development, and capital raising activities. Once the Company commences its planned principal operations, it will incur significant additional expenses. The Company is dependent upon additional capital resources for the commencement of its planned principal operations and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties; including failing to secure funding to operationalize the Company’s planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business.
 
No assurance is provided

WOLFPRINT 3D INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
As of December 31, 2016 and for the period then ended
  
Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid securities with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with clients and other factors. Provisions for losses on accounts receivable are determined on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance, and current economic conditions. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $6,096 of accounts receivable and no allowances.
 
Property and Equipment
 
The Company has a policy to capitalize expenditures with useful lives in excess of one year and costs exceeding $1,000 as property and equipment and depreciates such assets on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which are currently estimated at 4 years.
 
As of December 31, 2016, property and equipment consisted of the following:
 




Property and equipment, at cost

 
$
30,125

 


Accumulated depreciation

 

 
(16,873
)


Property and equipment, net

 
$
13,252

 
 
Depreciation expense totaled $163 for the period from August 18, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
 
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.
 
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active).
 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

WOLFPRINT 3D INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
As of December 31, 2016 and for the period then ended
 
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets approximate their fair value.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured.
 
The Company received $42,208 from an incubator during the period ended December 31, 2016. The Company does not expect to receive future grant revenue.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, with such expenses totaling $37,615 for the period ended December 31, 2016.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will be realized.
 
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. In accordance with ASC 740-10, for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements. The Company has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions.
 
The Company accounts for income taxes with the recognition of estimated income taxes payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current period and for the estimated future tax effect attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Measurement of deferred income items is based on enacted tax laws including tax rates, with the measurement of deferred income tax assets being reduced by available tax benefits not expected to be realized in the immediate future. The Company had no activity in the United States as of and for the period ended December 31, 2016. As such there has been no deferred tax assets or liabilities recorded.
 
The Subsidiary is not presently subject to any income tax in any taxing jurisdiction.
 
No assurance is provided

WOLFPRINT 3D INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
As of December 31, 2016 and for the period then ended
 
The Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns. The 2016 tax returns have been filed as of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. All tax periods since inception remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
 
Foreign Currency
 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States Dollars (“USD”), which is the reporting currency and the functional currency of the Company’s U.S. operations. The functional currency for the Subsidiary is its local currency. In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated to their USD equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Revenue and expenses were translated at the prevailing rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Related translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit, whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. At December 31, 2016, the foreign currency translation was immaterial and therefore not reflected in these consolidated financial statements.
 
NOTE 3: GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of $48,383 for the period ended December 31, 2016 and has produced insignificant revenues to date. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date of these consolidated financial statements is dependent upon its ability to obtain capital financing from investors sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such capital to produce profitable operating results. Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to seek additional capital from outside investors to satisfy its capital needs.
 
No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 4: STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
 
The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 20,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of December 31, 2016, 10,870 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. As previously mentioned in Note 1, on September 16, 2016, the stockholders owning 100% of the capital stock of Wolfprint 3D OÜ entered into an agreement with the Company pursuant to which such stockholders exchanged all of their shares of capital stock of Wolfprint 3D OÜ for an aggregate of 10,870 shares of the common stock of the Company. As a result of this exchange, Wolfprint 3D OÜ became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company has included the cumulative results of the Subsidiary’s operations prior to the Company’s August 18, 2016 inception date as transferred effective as of the Company’s date of formation.

NOTE 6: LOANS PAYABLE
 
On May 23, 2014, the Subsidiary entered into a loan agreement with a stockholder. On May 23, 2015, such loan was amended to increase the principal amount thereunder to $129,790. Such loan bears interest at an annual rate of 12%, has a maturity date of December 31, 2017 and is secured by the fixed assets of the Subsidiary. Interest expense for this loan totaled $14,481 for the one-year period ending December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of principal and interest outstanding under the loan were $129,790 and $23,120, respectively. The lender has the right to convert, at a discounted rate, $54,000 of the outstanding loan amount into certain financings undertaken by Wolfprint 3D OÜ, provided that the gross proceeds from any such financing equal at least $217,428. 
 
The loan bears interest at a rate of 2% per annum. This loan was one of a series of loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016. All of the other loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016 were repaid or rolled into the loan made on December 29, 2016. The December 29, 2016 loan is secured by the accounts receivable of Wolfprint 3D OÜ. As of December 31, 2016, total outstanding interest on the December 29, 2016 loan was $2.09. On January 20, 2017, Wolfprint 3D OÜ repaid the principal amount of the December 29, 2016 loan together with accrued interest thereon of $225.13.

This loan was one of a series of loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016. All of the other loans made by Healthcare Solutions OÜ to Wolfprint 3D OÜ during 2016 were repaid or rolled into the loan made on December 29, 2016. The December 29, 2016 loan is secured by the accounts receivable of Wolfprint 3D OÜ.

The Company also paid SI Securities LLC a cash placement fee in the aggregate amount of $30,344.50. The convertible promissory notes issued pursuant to the Regulation CF offering and the Regulation D offering are substantially similar. However, the convertible promissory notes issued pursuant to the Regulation D offering and to SI Securities LLC accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, while the convertible promissory notes issued pursuant to the Regulation CF offering accrue no interest. In the case of the convertible promissory notes issued pursuant to Regulation CF, upon the closing of a qualified equity financing, which is defined as the first sale by the Company of preferred stock in which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than $1 million, such convertible promissory notes will convert into shares of the Company’s preferred stock at the earlier of (i) the Company’s election or (ii) the occurrence of a corporate transaction. In the case of the convertible promissory notes issued pursuant to Regulation D, upon the occurrence of a qualified equity financing, such convertible promissory notes, together with accrued interest thereon, will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s preferred stock.
 
The price at which the convertible promissory notes issued by the Company pursuant to Regulation CF and Regulation D will convert into shares of preferred stock upon the occurrence of a qualified equity financing equals the lesser of: A) 20% less than the price per share paid by the investors purchasing preferred stock in the qualified equity financing and B) a price per share equal to $4,500,000 divided by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. In the event of a corporate transaction, if it occurs prior to a qualified equity financing or if the value of the converted shares that the investor would receive is less than twice the amount the investor invested, the investor will receive a payment equal to twice the amount of its initial investment in lieu of the converted shares.
 
The net proceeds received by the Company from the offerings pursuant to Regulation CF and Regulation D were $564,588.40.

We are Wolfprint 3D with a mission to bring humanity into VR. Our 3D scanning technology enables us to create realistic avatars of people for gaming and/or VR experiences.
Quick note
We are currently trending on https://www.producthunt.com/ You can find us on the homepage (Wolfprint 3D), where you can check out the product design and also our equity crowdfunding campaign.
Why is this important?
In order to make social interactions in VR more natural, believable and immersive we believe that every person needs a realistic avatar to represent themselves.
We are eager to hear from virtual reality communities how they see our product fitting into their games and VR projects.
Interested in using our scan data for your projects?
If you decide to check out the Product Hunt page or visit our site http://lunascanner.com/?ref=producthunt you can download a sample pack of scan data that can be implemented into games or VR. Additionally we can provide you with full head models ready for animation and additional support.

17 commentssharereportall 17 commentssorted by: besttopnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta)[–]OrangePeel_ 2 points3 points4 points 8 months ago (8 children)Photogrammetry/ 3d scanning apps are quickly improving in quality and a lot of them are extremely cost efficient and/or free. How do you plan to seperate yourself from the app competition aside from a slightly higher quality (that scanning apps are almost sure to close the gap with). Also, what price point are you planning on selling to consumers? 

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (7 children)Thanks for the comment!
Sure, mobile scanning is the future. Currently however there are no mobile apps out there that can capture a scan that has enough quality that it can be further implemented into games/vr. There are of course many photogrammetry based scanning apps out there but they are mostly meant for scanning static subjects. To scan a human you really need a synchronized capture from multiple angles as even the slightest movement can ruin the result.  
Now that being said, we are also in parallel working on a mobile solution to scale the scan acquisition further. ;)
As far as the price point goes, we are not completely sure yet. We might give people access to the core functionality of importing your scan into a game/VR experience and charge extra for additional features through a monthly subscription. Those extra features could for instance be customising your avatar with cosmetic upgrades.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]OrangePeel_ 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago (6 children)Interesting. Are yall planning on opening your database up for outside scan submissions such as the unity asset store and highfidelity.io are currently doing or are you planning on only storing data collected from your booths? 
Final question - I saw some animated characters in your video. I assume that those are done in post animation. Do you see any opportunity for capturing movement within the booth? 

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (2 children)We will enable developers to integrate our scan data into games/vr experiences through an API. Currently the data gets to the database from our booths and in the future, probably from our 3D scanning mobile app. As we would be the connector for scans and games then it is a good possibility that we will enable other scan providers, which could be apps or different types of booths to submit to the overall pool of scans. Considering that the final output from our side is always a standardised avatar ready to be implemented to games etc.
Yes, the animations are currently added in post. We have developed a workflow that allows us to take the "raw data" and turn it into a standardised head model very easily without compromising on scan quality. Onto that you can apply any animation or asset (hats, glasses, hair styles etc) with a press of a button. It would definitely be possible to capture facial animation in the booth and apply that onto the model afterwards (Christmas greetings, anyone?) if we decide to do so.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]OrangePeel_ 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago* (1 child)Thanks for the info! 

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (0 children)You are very welcome, thanks for joining in

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]OrangePeel_ 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago (2 children)Sorry, one more. Ive seen multiple scanning booths but none with payment options built in. Do you see any opportunity to work with retailers either through licensing or some sort of payment plan to feature the booths in a retail space selling vr/gaming devices? 

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (1 child)Yes! In one of our scanners located in Heureka science museum in Finland we sell digital characters that are connected to the location. The characters are then customised with the facial scan data. And we include mobile VR headsets with every purchase so that people can check out their characters in VR.
Ensuring that proper licensing deals are in place, you could imagine a scenario of taking your scan in the booth and buying a game key right there aswell which means when you go home and install the new GTA let's say, your character is already waiting. :)

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]OrangePeel_ 2 points3 points4 points 8 months ago (0 children)This would be the most exciting application for me when thinking about a return on investment. Especially if you are able to work within samsung or microsoft or one of the brands selling headsets. The hard part in my opinion would be convincing the consumer purchase an avatar without having a streamlined process of immediately inserting the character into a digital environment. If yall can develop that, I would be very impressed. 

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]remosito 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago* (1 child)Like the sound of a future where we such 3D scan boothes accessible. And can import the scans into major social VR experiences. Or fun facial editors. How 
Would definitely visit and have a scan made!
Good luck!

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago (0 children)Yes, thank you! That's one of our future goals. To extend the usability of our scan data and bring "real people" into VR apps, games, chats and so on. We think that having a personal avatar is a big leap from generic avatars you can see in demos right now.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]NeonNina 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (1 child)That's a really cool business idea. I've read the idea in the books Snow Crash and Ready Player One, surprised I didn't think of it as applicable to modern VR.

That's a really cool business idea. I've read the idea in the books Snow Crash and Ready Player One, surprised I didn't think of it as applicable to modern VR.

Yes, imagine a large number of people conversing in VR and they would actually be recognizable. One thing is communicating with people you see every day like your family or co-workers. Another thing is meeting face-to-face with people you might never meet in real life. Imagine a well known coach giving a lecture in VR to thousands of people at the same time while everyone gets a personal session.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]AnotherVRDev 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (1 child)Congrats on your progress so far! 
It seems pretty daunting to build a platform like this around an open file format.  Do you plan to retain your file format in OBJ or are you developing a proprietary means for accessing the models?

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (0 children)In order to connect as many people with VR apps or games as possible we need to make sure that the final output from us is something that's as straight forward to use for developers as it can be. We are currently growing our database and making first tests integrating our scans into social VR environments so the file format requirement really isn't ironed out yet. What I can say however, as even the first tests we have run now have animated faces, we most likely won't output just OBJ files. The decision to use OBJ as the current format is just to make sure that we can get the data onto the hands of many devs. That might not be the case when we start giving access to rigged and animation-ready full head models based on customer scan data. Hope that clarifies ;)

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]Moonracer2000 1 point2 points3 points 8 months ago (1 child)It is good to see people stepping up to the challenge. It is only a matter of time before this becomes marketable.
A few issues I see are:
There needs to be a widely used avatar format for this to work, which is a big problem. Having a hi-def 3D scan of my face/body is only as useful as the % of software on the market I can use it in.
Preparing for the moment when someone steals another users avatar for scamming/griefing. Steal a user's account and face and walk into an online corporate meeting.

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]tiivikWolfprint 3D[S] 0 points1 point2 points 8 months ago (0 children)Standardisation must be nailed indeed. Fortunately we have already created a workflow which can turn our highres scans into standard heads. Now we need solid middleware that will speak to the game/engine.
And you are absolutely correct about security. Those are the issues that must be addressed carefully.

Startup Wolfprint 3D Tests Approach for Creating 'Personal' Avatars | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantKevork Djansezian—Getty ImagesGamingThis Startup Wants to Help You Create a Personal AvatarReutersNov 15, 2016For gamers fed up with being just another avatar when playing with their friends, an Estonian firm has come up with a photo booth that creates a 3D image of your face.At Wolfprint 3D's white egg-shaped pod in a suburban shopping mall in Estonia's capital city Tallinn, six cameras and a touch screen allow people to create a high-resolution 3D face and enter the increasingly personalized world of virtual reality.By 2017, Wolfprint aims to make getting a personalized avatar into games as quick and easy as changing clothes or equipment in existing games and interactive VR platforms.But unlike other 3D scanning technologies, which usually involves a full body scan and require a trip to a studio at a cost of some $500, the Luna Scanner can be installed almost anywhere.For now, the scans in the Tallinn booth are offered for free as the company tests the unit and collects biometric data.Minutes after the photo is taken, a link to the 3D image is sent to the user's nominated email account and can be viewed on a VR viewer app on a mobile phone.And at a science museum in Helsinki, a Luna Scanner allows people to almost instantly put their faces on a virtual astronaut and start exploring VR space.Wolfprint 3D plans to mass produce its distinctive booths and expand beyond existing sites in New York, Finland and Estonia to theme parks and exhibitions on the U.S. East Coast."Every person needs a unique 3D avatar of themselves for VR to truly become social," Wolfprint 3D's co-founder Kaspar Tiri told Reuters.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured 9 months agoWolfprint 3DA 3D scanner to create realistic avatars of people for VROculus RiftPlayStation VRHTC Vive+ 4get it603 ShareFeatured commentTimmu Tõke@timmutoke · CEO at Wolf3DHey Product Hunters!

This is Timmu from Wolfprint 3D. Our goal is to bring humanity into VR. We use high-quality 3D scanning technology to create realistic avatars of people for VR and games. 

Our first product is a 3D scanning booth that does studio quality scans automatically at almost a 0 cost. 

Why is it relevant?
We believe social VR will be an important part of how we communicate online in the future. To make social interactions seamless and authentic, every person needs a realistic avatar to represent themselves in VR. 

FYI: We are currently running an equity crowdfunding campaign, which you can check out here:

For developers: Here’s a sample pack with some 3D scans and avatars you can use in your projects:

Once another startup does this for cheap and have their api open for VR applications, it will be like OpenID for VR applications. 

Cool idea but i think make it open source so you can become bigger or you will die quickly, VR is the future. 7Share·9 months agoTimmu TõkeMaker@timmutoke · CEO at Wolf3D@kingrockie Thank you for your thoughts, it would be interesting to discuss. 1Share·9 months agoView more comments👋 Welcome to Product HuntGet the best new products in your inbox, daily.SubscribeRelated ProductsBlenderOpen source 3D.
