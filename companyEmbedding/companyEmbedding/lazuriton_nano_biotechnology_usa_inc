Note:

(1) This amount does not include the registration fee of $20.14.

The foregoing purposes represent our best estimate of the allocation of the
gross proceeds from this offering based upon the current state of our business
operations, current plans, and the current economic and industry conditions. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our development efforts, sales and marketing activities,
the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, our competition and the
other factors.

We planned our progress based on raising $200,000 from this offering. We have
taken careful consideration to determine that $200,000 is the amount we need to
sustain our operations for the next 12 months. In the event that we do not
realize the full proceeds from this offering, we will be forced to scale back
our efforts to accommodate for a reduced amount of funds. In this event, we will
be required to consider the then available options to determine how to fund the
shortfall. Those options include the private placement of our securities and
loans by Chih-Yuan Hsiao, our president and a member of our board of directors. 
In that regard, on November 19, 2015, Mr. Hsiao provided us with a written
funding commitment for 24 months in the amount $400,000, which accrues no
interest. All amounts funded by Mr. Hsiao pursuant to that funding commitment
are due and payable by us on demand by Mr. Hsiao. There is no particular notice
required to be given by Mr. Hsiao regarding that demand; provided, however, such
demand will not be made sooner than November 19, 2016. During that time that
Mr. Hsiao is our president or a member of our board of directors, we believe
that any such demand will not be upon any unreasonable terms. We can provide no
guarantee or assurance that in the event of that demand, we can pay the amount
demanded, or any other amount, on the date for which payment is demanded. A
copy of that funding commitment is attached as Exhibit 10.3 to that registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part. As of March 31, 2016, we owed Mr.
Hsiao $80,207 pursuant to that funding commitment. Any interruption in our
business will greatly reduce our chances for success.
 
We reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of the need
for more working capital. We may determine that we need more working capital in
order to implement the growth strategy and operations set forth herein. The
reallocation of any funds may necessitate an additional sale of our equity
securities. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional
capital from any institution or individual investors.


The fertilizer business is characterized by vigorous competition throughout the
world. Brand recognition, price, service, quality and availability are some of
the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. 
Advertising, promotion, merchandising and the pace of new product introductions
have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. We compete against a
number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we
do.

Our principal competitors are Hsin Fang Nano Technology Ltd. and Unicat Nano
Advanced Materials & Devices Technology Ltd. We also face competition from a
number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed
their own brands.

Our products have relatively low manufacturing costs, which allow us to offer
competitive pricing to our customers. Additionally, we believe that by
providing outstanding customer service we can build customer loyalty to our
brand.


Company Description
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 2, 2015. We are a 
development stage company with a principal business of marketing, distributing 
and selling Nano fertilizer products in Asia, with the exception of Taiwan. The
Nano fertilizer products are manufactured by Lazuriton Nano


 Biotechnology Co., 
Ltd., a Taiwanese corporation, headquartered in Taiwan (the “Manufacturer”).

Effective December 1, 2015, we entered into a Marketing and Distribution 
Agreement with the Manufacturer, whereby the Manufacturer authorizes the Company
to market, sell and distribute those Nano fertilizer products manufactured by 
the Manufacturer. The Marketing Agreement grants the Company a non-exclusive 
right to market, sell and distribute the Nano Fertilizer Products in Asia, with
the exception of Taiwan. The Marketing Agreement is effective December 1, 2015,
and continues for one year thereafter and may renew automatically for periods of
one year each, unless one party gives notice to the other party at least 30 days
prior to the expiration of that agreement of its intention not to renew. 

We anticipate that we will receive revenue from the distribution and sale of the
Nano Fertilizer Products. We plan to market and sell the Nano Fertilizer 
Products to resellers of fertilizers who are aware of the needs of the their 
customers. Additionally, we may target individual farmers and households.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
