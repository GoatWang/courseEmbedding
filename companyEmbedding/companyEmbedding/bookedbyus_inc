There are many providers of rich media marketing software. The market for rich 
media marketing software is still in its infancy stage it is ripe to develop 
in the next 18 months due to changes in technology that greatly affect 
advertisement, such as the release of Apples iPad, and the growing number smart
phones entering the market.  The need for push technology over the web /through
email or through mobile device applications is rapidly growing. 

Competition in the markets is likely to remain intense but is expected to 
increasingly center on integrated rather than stand-alone applications. 
Software providers are continuously looking for third party resellers to add 
value to their products and increase their market share. 

As a provider of wireless solutions, Bookedbyus has assessed its potential 
competitors based primarily on their functionality of wireless product, the 
security and scalability of their architecture, and industry focus. Due to our 
strong emphasis in the application software sector we have also compared 
ourselves to software providers focused solely in the software design sector. 

FOCUSED PROVIDERS: These are companies that have built a wireless set of tools 
that attempt to address the needs of a specific vertical market. Currently most
of the competition in this sector derive their revenue from infra-structure and
ongoing professional services and build to a specific device type 
(i.e.Blackberry, Palm, and Pocket/PC).   For these companies to adapt their 
offering to next generation devices would mean re-architecting the way they 
conduct business and losing the infra-structure and professional services 
components of their business. They have, to date, focused on financial 
institutions or carriers for penetration.  These include Aligo, Infowave, 
Aether, 724, and iAnywhere. Our difference should come from our ability to 
support over 1,000 device types allowing us to go after the consumer 
application also. 

Application SPECIFIC PROVIDERS: There are a number of SMS and mobile phone 
download application providers in today's market, including Cellectivity, 
Mfuse, and Airborne Entertainment. These companies sell their applications and 
content and therefore are competing with the existing software providers. 

Our difference should be that we never produce content. Whether it is an eDrive
or iDrive solution we provide the frame work application. We focus exclusively 
on delivering content on behalf of our clients or partners. Therefore we should
never compete against the companies that have an established client base in 
the Internet market.  They become our partners and introduce us to that client 
base. 

SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS: Custom solutions should still consume some of the wireless
market share as large organizations continually try to build ground-up 
solutions for each client, under the assumption that wireless is easy and can 
be built without the aid of tools and wireless platforms. These companies 
include IBM, EDS, Accenture, Bearing Point, and BEA Systems. However, these 
companies may also be potential clients and Value Added Resellers of Bookedbyus
suite of products. 

With any growing and expanding market, Bookedbyus also expects new competitors 
to emerge. The wireless market is not expected to be any different, 
particularly with the prevalence of open standards. Although various 
competitors have emerged, the mobile application market is still in its 
infancy. There are no dominant players that address our target market with 
these types of capabilities.


Company Description
Bookedbyus Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company
on December 27, 2007 and established a fiscal year end of August 31. Bookedbyus
Inc. is a development stage company and we have commenced only limited
operations, primarily focused on organizational matters in


 connection with this
offering. We have been in existence since December 27, 2007, and entered into a
licensing agreement with Digital Programma, Inc. on January 1, 2011. Due to a
lack of funding, we have not implemented our Plan of Operations. The Company is 
not engaged in continued business and has minimal operations. 

We are a licensed distributor for Digital Programa Inc. We intend to further
develop and market two software applications licensed from Digital Program Inc.:
“eDrive” and “iDrive”.  eDrive is a web and email based rich media application
that allows clients to push rich media marketing material to its customers with
a fully integrated back end including business analytics.  eDrive, allows
companies to market their message or product directly to their customers. iDrive
is a software development tool  that can easily build iPhone, iPad and smart
phone applications designed to access and view rich media managed by eDrive. The
Company has not yet implemented its business model.

November 30, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The
Company has a loss of $10,237 for the three months period ended
November 30, 2016 and has a working capital deficit of $223,895 at
November 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

Management
cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve
profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise
additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that the
Company’s capital resources should be adequate to continue
operating and maintaining its business strategy during the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2017. However, if the Company is unable to
raise additional capital in the near future, due to the
Company’s liquidity problems, management expects that the
Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek
additional capital on less favorable terms and/or pursue other
remedial measures. These unaudited interim financial statements do
not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

 

As at
November 30, 2016, the Company was not engaged in continued
business, and had significant operating expenses. Although
management is currently attempting to implement its business plan
and is seeking additional sources of financing, there is no
assurance the activity will be successful. Accordingly, the Company
must rely on its president to perform essential functions without
compensation until a business operation can be commenced. The
unaudited interim financial statements do not include any
adjustments that may result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

Basis of
Presentation




 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Bookedbyus
Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements
for the year ended August 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on Form
10-K. In the opinion of the management, all normal recurring
adjustments which are necessary for a fair presentation of
financial statements of the results for the interim period ended
November 30, 2016, have been included. The results of operations
for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial
statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent
fiscal period ended August 31, 2016, as reported in the Form 10-K,
have been omitted.

Contracts
Under Commitment




 

 

The
Company has leased an office in Los Angeles California for a period
of twelve months commencing January 1, 2014. The office is located
at Suite 101, 619 S. Ridgley Los Angeles CA 90036 ($2,000 per
month) due on the first calendar day of each month. This twelve
month term automatically renews if no written notice of termination
is given 30 days prior to the end on each term. The landlord agrees
to accept either cash or shares as settlement for each months'
rent.

 

The
landlord will defer rent in lieu of shares at 0.10 a share as per
the Registration Statement or cash. As a concession for this
deferment, the landlord will charge an additional 20% per month for
each month deferred. (ie. $400 or 4,000 shares at $0.10 per
share.)

 

The
California lease agreement was terminated effective August 31, 2016
and the Company has the option to settle the outstanding rent
liability through the issuance of 768,000 common shares.

 

Both
parties agree to the deferment schedule being at the end of the
term. All deferred rent subject to the 20% per month will be
collectable only at the end of the term.

 

The
Company has entered into a consulting agreement with Brad Kersch
for marketing and business consulting. The term of the agreement is
one year beginning January 1, 2014. Consideration for such
consulting services is $2,000 per month payable in cash or common
shares, at

	RIC


	) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the


	Code


	) and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC in the future. AICs principal place of business is 9 West 57



	th



	Street, New York, NY 10019. In connection with its initial public
	offering, AIC filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-153879) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the


	Securities Act


	). AIC completed its initial public offering of its common stock, par value $0.001 on
	April 8, 2004, and has raised additional capital through subsequent offerings from time to time.




	AICs investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity
	investments. AIC invests primarily in middle market companies, where it believes the supply of primary capital is limited and investment opportunities are most attractive. AICs primary investment mandate (as more fully described in AICs
	disclosure documents, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time) is to focus on senior secured loans and subordinated and mezzanine investments and/or equity in private middle market companies, which may include an equity component such as
	warrants. AIC may also invest in the securities of

	public companies. In addition, AIC and its Affiliates together have the ability to provide one stop financing with the ability to hold larger investments than many of AICs
	competitors. The ability to hold larger investments benefits AICs stockholders by: (i) increasing flexibility, (ii) broadening market relationships and access to deal flow, (iii) allowing AIC to optimize its portfolio
	composition, (iv) allowing AIC to provide capital to middle market companies, which AIC believes currently have limited access to capital from traditional lending sources, and (v) potentially increasing the availability of more favorable
	investment terms and protections.




	AICs business and affairs are managed under the direction of a board

	ORDER REQUESTED 








	The Applicants respectfully request an Order of the Commission under Sections 17(d) and 57(i) and Rule 17d-1 thereunder to permit, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Application
	(the


	Conditions


	), any of the AIC Funds, the Closed-End Funds (each of the AIC Funds and the Closed-End Funds an


	Investor


	,


	


	and collectively the


	Investors


	)
	and/or one or more Affiliated Funds to enter into Co-Investment Transactions with each other.




	The Investors
	and the Affiliated Funds seek relief to invest in Co-Investment Transactions because such Co-Investment Transactions would otherwise be prohibited by either or both of Rule 17d-1 and Section 57(a)(4). This Application seeks relief in order to
	(i) enable the Investors and Affiliated Funds to avoid, among other things, the practical commercial and/or economic difficulties of trying to structure,




	 




	9







	negotiate and persuade counterparties to enter into transactions while awaiting the granting of the relief requested in individual applications with respect to each Co-Investment Transaction that
	arises in the future and (ii) enable the Investors and the Affiliated Funds to avoid the significant legal and other expenses that would be incurred in preparing such individual applications.



	 





	 





	A.






	OVERVIEW







	Potential Co-Investment Transactions arise as a result of certain processes in place across the breadth of the Apollo
	platform. These processes are described below.




	The Advisers manage numerous private equity, credit-oriented
	capital markets and real estate funds and separate accounts with aggregate assets of $86 billion as of March 31, 2012. In order to manage the assets of those funds and separate accounts, Apollo Global Management, LLC, and its affiliated
	companies employed over 200 investment professionals as of March 31, 2012. Apollo Global Management, LLC and its affiliated companies other than the Affiliated Funds, the Closed-End Funds, the AIC Funds and any portfolio companies thereof, are
	referred to collectively as 


	Apollo Global Management


	. The Apollo funds are presented with thousands of investment opportunities each year.




	The Apollo platform, through the AIC Funds, the Closed-End Funds and the Affiliated Funds, offers a number of financing
	solutions (


	Products



	





	) to prospective issuers of debt and/or equity. Apollo currently maintains a separate investment committee with respect to each major Product area. For example, there are currently 15
	investment committees for capital markets Products, which is the group responsible for the AIC funds and Closed-End Funds. Each investment committee generally meets at least weekly to discuss the pipeline for that Product area and considers
	investment opportunities for the funds and other accounts the members of that committee oversee.




	 




	10







	In general, when an investment opportunity arises, the opportunity receives
	an initial screen by the investment team assigned to the opportunity and, if the opportunity survives the initial screen, is subject to diligence and analysis. If the opportunity has merit, the investment team prepares and distributes an
	investment memorandum for review. All of the portfolio managers in the Apollo platform whose funds are eligible to participate in the investment opportunity are simultaneously notified of the investment opportunity and have access to the materials
	relating to the opportunity. The appropriate investment committee or committees reviews and discusses the opportunity at the investment committee meeting following distribution of the investment memorandum. Investment committee meetings are
	generally held on a weekly basis. All portfolio managers across the Apollo platform may participate in any investment committee meeting to discuss an opportunity.




	After discussion at the investment committee meeting, the investment committee may take one or more actions in considering
	the investment opportunity, which may include rejecting the opportunity outright, requesting more information, after which the opportunity is brought back to the investment committee for review again at a later date, or approving the investment.




	After approval of an investment opportunity, portfolio managers interested in the opportunity for their
	clients submit allocation requests and traders coordinate consolidated orders across the platform.




	 




	11







	In connection with secondary market opportunities, portfolio managers,
	analysts and traders may also communicate such opportunities through email and a dedicated on-line chat room.




	If a portfolio manager challenges an allocation amount or eligibility, an allocation committee reviews the circumstances and other relevant factors and makes a final decision. As a check on
	the process, portfolio managers receive trade blotters at the end of each trading day to ensure coordination on buys and sells across the platform. In addition, the capital markets group holds weekly meetings, which include capital markets
	management, portfolio managers and business leaders, to discuss opportunities and strategies. Investment updates are circulated to portfolio managers and investment ideas are discussed in various meetings as well as generally on the trading floor.




	Allocations are, to the extent possible, based on order size from the particular manager. Numerous factors
	enter into both a portfolio managers determination of the order size he or she desires and the investment committees and allocation committees allocations in the event the opportunity is of insufficient size to satisfy all
	requests. These factors have been established by those governing bodies, which have determined that the factors should be taken into account when determining allocations. The current factors include: (i) the relative exposure of any particular
	fund to the type of investment opportunity in terms of its existing investment portfolio; (ii) relative exposure of the fund to market trends; (iii) the investment objective of the fund; (iv) permitted leverage and available financing
	for the investment opportunity (including, without limitation, taking into account the levels/rates that would be required to obtain appropriate return); (v) likelihood of current income; (vi) size, liquidity and duration of the investment
	opportunity; (vii) seniority of loan and other capital structure criteria; (viii) with respect




	 




	12







	to an investment opportunity originated by a third party, the relationships of a particular fund (or the portfolio manager) to such third party; (ix) tax planning; (x) regulatory
	concerns; (xi) supply or demand for an investment opportunity at a given price level; (xii) a funds risk or investment concentration parameters (including, without limitation, parameters such as geography, industry, issuer,
	volatility, leverage and other similar risk metrics); (xiii) whether the investment opportunity is a Follow-On Transaction (as defined below); and (xiv) such other criteria as are reasonably related to reasonable allocation of a particular
	investment opportunity to one or more clients as determined by the portfolio managers, investment committees and allocations committees (

	e.g.

	, in the case of a fund ramp-up period or when establishing a particular investment strategy or
	product). In addition, the Advisers allocation committees review each Investors allocation policies and procedures from time to time. The Advisers compliance team reviews all allocation decisions retroactively and each appropriate
	allocation committee reviews all primary allocations and a sampling of secondary allocation decisions on a quarterly basis.




	In the case of the AIC Funds, the Chief Executive Officer of AIC or his designee is invited to attend all of the investment committees of all Product areas for capital markets. The Chief Executive Officer
	of AIC and the Chief Investment Officer of AIM, or their designees (collectively referred to as, the


	Executive Officers


	) are included in the investment committee processes. Applicants note that the Executive Officers
	receive all relevant investment-related memoranda and material investment updates submitted to each applicable investment committee. An Executive Officer also attends the weekly meetings that are held with the portfolio managers in the capital
	markets group where market information and specific investment ideas are discussed. In addition, one or both




	 




	13







	Executive Officers have access to chat rooms and other forums to review discussions on potential transactions. At the end of each trading day, the Executive Officers receive trade blotters
	summarizing the relevant trade activity. These investment, information access, approval and allocation processes are referred to collectively as the






	Procedures


	.


	










	The President or Chief Investment Officer of any Closed-End Fund is involved in the investment committee processes in the
	same manner and takes part in all of the Procedures, as set forth above with respect to the AIC Funds.




	Applicants believe that the Procedures that are used to notify the Executive Officers of each AIC Fund and their
	counterparts at any Closed-End Fund of Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within the then-current Objectives and Strategies



	8



	of each AIC Fund and each Closed-End Fund are reasonably designed to ensure that an Executive Officer is notified of
	all Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within the then current Objectives and Strategies of any AIC Fund or Closed-End Fund that are considered by any investment committee of the Advisers.




	In connection with the allocation process, the applicable adviser to each Investor (each, an


	Investor
	Adviser


	) will then follow the Conditions with respect to considering and, if applicable, investing in, the Potential Co-Investment Transaction. AIC or a Closed-End Fund will only participate in Potential Co-Investment Transaction if
	the Board, after appropriate consideration under the Conditions, approves it.



	9






	 








	8

	 






	Objectives and Strategies means (i) with respect to each BDC and Closed-End Fund, its investment objectives and significant strategies, as described in
	its registration statement on Form N-2, other filings it has made with the Commission under the Securities Act, or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and its reports to stockholders, and (ii) with respect to the AIC
	Downstream Funds, as described in the applicable disclosure documents and/or operating agreements because such fund do not make public filings with the Commission, and for purposes of the Order, each as further defined by the Board, including a
	Required Majority of the Board, or the Independent Party, respectively, from time to time using objective criteria to focus the investment objective.











	9

	 






	For purposes of this Application, approval by AICs and the Closed-End Funds Boards may be effected by a majority approval of the Co-Investment Approval
	Committee, which will consist of a required majority as defined in Section 57(o) (a




	Required Majority


	






	) of the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that Co-Investment Transaction under
	Section 57(o) (the




	Eligible Directors


	






	). For purposes of the Order, the Closed-End Funds will follow Section 57(o).






	 




	14







	With respect to the AIC Downstream Funds, their respective investment
	managers will independently analyze and evaluate each investment opportunity available to them. To the extent required under the Conditions, each AIC Downstream Fund will have a transaction committee or an advisory committee consisting either of
	AICs Board or of at least one member who is not affiliated with any AIC Fund, Closed-End Fund or Affiliated Fund or who is an individual (otherwise unaffiliated with the AIC Downstream Fund, any Closed-End Fund or Apollo Global Management (as
	defined below) generally) engaged by the AIC Downstream Fund solely for the purpose of providing an independent role (AICs Board or such individual, the


	Independent Party


	) with veto power over investments with
	affiliated entities. All Co-Investment Transactions between an AIC Downstream Fund and a Closed-End Fund and an AIC Downstream Fund and an Affiliated Fund must be approved by the AIC Downstream Funds Independent Party. Thus, in a Co-Investment
	Transaction, if the applicable investment manager determines that the opportunity is suitable for an AIC Downstream Fund and an Affiliated Fund and/or a Closed-End Fund has confirmed its desire to also participate, the investment manager will
	forward the opportunity to the AIC Downstream Funds Independent Party for consideration.



	10






	 








	10

	 






	With respect to any co-investment transaction among the AIC Funds, no relief is required because the AIC Funds affiliation with each other results solely from
	AICs control of the AIC Downstream Funds. As a result, co-investment transactions among the AIC Funds would be exempt from the affiliated transaction prohibitions of Section 57(a)(4) pursuant to Rule 57b-1.






	 




	15







	Co-Investment Transactions will be effected under the Conditions of the
	Order; however, from time to time the Advisers in consultation with the Board of each Investor, the chief compliance officers of each Investor and the Advisers, and counsel, may modify the allocation policies and procedures of the Apollo platform
	based on changes in Apollos business or the regulatory framework in which Apollo operates. Such changes will be designed to be consistent with the principle that senior advisory personnel of the Investors (including their controlled funds)
	will be aware of all relevant potential Co-Investment Transactions considered by Advisers across the Apollo platform and be able to take appropriate action with respect to such opportunities.




	Aside from typical Co-Investment Transactions, there may also be instances where one or more Investors and one or more
	Affiliated Funds find themselves holding securities of the same class that were acquired through Non-Negotiated Transactions in the same portfolio company,



	11



	but where the respective acquisitions of those investments did not implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of
	Rule 17d-1 or Section 57(a)(4), as applicable. It is possible that one or more AIC Funds or one or more Closed-End Funds and one or more Affiliated Funds may exit the investment or complete an additional investment in that portfolio company,
	consisting of a debt or equity investment or warrants, or the exercise of conversion privileges, rights offerings, call options or any other rights to acquire additional securities of or interests in the issuer in a manner where such additional
	transaction would otherwise be prohibited by either or both of Rule 17d-1 and Section 57(a)(4), as applicable, as modified by the exemptive rules adopted by the Commission



	 








	11

	 







	For this purpose, a Non-Negotiated Transaction is a transaction in which no Investor or Affiliated Fund participating in the transaction negotiates any
	of the terms of the security other than price and price-related terms such as interest rate or exercise price, including but not limited to those transactions that qualify under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, secondary purchases of investments and
	syndicated investments.







	 




	16







	under the Act (any such exchange, follow-on, disposition or additional investment, whether following a Co-Investment Transaction or a Non-Negotiated Transaction, a 


	Follow-On
	Transaction


	)



	12



	. Such Follow-On Transactions
	must be completed pursuant to the Conditions.




	Determinations regarding when the Investors and the Existing
	Affiliated Funds will enter into a Co-Investment Transaction or complete a Follow-On Transaction are made by the specific funds investment adviser or manager (or investment committee thereof) (

	e.g

	., the Affiliated Advisers make
	determinations for the Existing Affiliated Funds and the Investor Advisers make determinations for the Investors), and then approved by the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, as required under the Conditions.

	APPLICABLE LAW






	 





	 




	1.





	Section 17(d), Rule 17d-1 and Section 57(a)(4)







	Rule 17d-1 generally prohibits an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)), or an affiliated person of such affiliated person, of a registered closed-end investment company acting as
	principal, from effecting any transaction in which the registered closed-end investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant, in contravention of such rules as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing
	participation by the registered closed-end investment company on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such first or second tier affiliate. Rule 17d-1 generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an



	 








	12

	 







	In this Application, references to Co-Investment Transaction include Follow-On Transactions.







	 




	17







	affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any
	joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan, as defined in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application.




	Similarly, with regard to BDCs, Section 57(a)(4) prohibits certain persons specified in Section 57(b) from
	participating in a joint transaction with the BDC, or a company controlled by the BDC, in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. In particular, as modified by Rule 57b-1, Section 57(a)(4) applies to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Any director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is an affiliated person of the
	forgoing pursuant to section 2(a)(3)(C); or






	 





	 




	




	 





	Any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either controlling, controlled
	by, or under common control with, a BDC (except the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC, would not be directly or indirectly under the control of a person who controls the BDC);



	13



	 or any person who is an affiliated person of any of the
	forgoing within the meaning of section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D).







	Section 2(a)(3)(C) defines an
	affiliated person of another person to include any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(3)(D) defines any officer, director, partner,
	copartner, or employee of an affiliated person as an affiliated person. Section 2(a)(9) defines control as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the
	result of an official position with that company. Under Section 2(a)(9) a



	 








	13

	 







	Also excluded from this category by Rule 57b-1, is any person who would otherwise be included (a) solely because that person is directly or indirectly
	controlled by a business development company, or (b) solely because that person is, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D), an affiliated person of a person described in (a) above.







	 




	18







	person who beneficially owns, either directly or through one or more controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control such company. The
	Commission and its staff have indicated on a number of occasions their belief that an investment adviser that provides discretionary investment management services to a fund and that sponsored, selected the initial directors, and provides
	administrative or other non-advisory services to the fund, controls such fund, absent compelling evidence to the
	contrary.



	14






	 





	 




	2.





	Rule 17d-1







	Rule 17d-1 generally prohibits participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in
	Section 2(a)(3)) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan, as defined
	in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission by order upon application.




	Rule 17d-1 was promulgated by
	the Commission pursuant to Section 17(d) and made applicable to persons subject to Sections 57(a) and (d) by Section 57(i). Section 57(i) provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under Sections 57(a) and (d), the
	Commissions rules under Section 17(d) applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply to persons subject to the prohibitions of Section 57(a) or (d). Because the Commission has not adopted any rules
	under Section 57(a) or (d), Rule 17d-1 applies to persons subject to the prohibitions of Section 57(a) or (d).

	Applicants seek relief pursuant to Rule 17d-1 and Section 57(c), which
	permit the Commission to authorize joint transactions upon application. In passing upon applications filed pursuant to Rule 17d-1, the Commission is directed by Rule 17d-1(b) to consider whether the participation of a registered investment company
	or controlled company thereof in the joint enterprise or joint arrangement under scrutiny is consistent with provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less
	advantageous than that of other participants.




	The Commission has stated that Section 17(d), upon which
	Rule 17d-1 is based, and upon which Section 57(a)(4) was modeled, was designed to protect investment companies from self-dealing and overreaching by insiders. The Commission has also taken notice that there may be transactions subject to these

	The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has enunciated a like rationale for the purpose behind Section 17(d): The objective of [Section] 17(d) . . . is to prevent . . .
	injuring the interest of stockholders of registered investment companies by causing the company to participate on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participants.



	16



	 Furthermore, Congress acknowledged that the protective system
	established by the enactment of Section 57 is similar to that applicable to registered investment companies under section 17, and rules thereunder, but is modified to address concerns relating to unique characteristics presented by
	business development companies.

	NEED FOR RELIEF







	Co-Investment Transactions are prohibited by either or both of Rule 17d-1 and Section 57(a)(4) without a prior exemptive order of the Commission to the extent that the Affiliated Funds and the Investors
	fall within the category of persons described by Rule 17d-1 and/or Section 57(b), as modified by Rule 57b-1 thereunder, as applicable, vis-à-vis each Investor.




	The AIC Funds, each of the Closed-End Funds and each of the Affiliated Funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons
	vis-à-vis each other within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) by reason of common control because (i) controlled Affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC manage each of the Affiliated Funds and ASFRF and may be deemed to control any
	future Closed-End Fund, (ii) Apollo Global Management, LLC controls AIM, which manages AIC pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, and (iii) AIC Downstream Funds, are, and, in the future will be, deemed to be controlled by AIM, AIC
	or certain of AICs subsidiaries. Thus, each of the Affiliated Funds could be deemed to be a person related to the AIC Funds in a manner described by Section 57(b) and related to the Closed-End Funds in a manner described by Rule 17d-1;
	and therefore the prohibitions of Section 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d-1 would apply respectively to prohibit

	the Affiliated Funds from participating in Co-Investment Transactions with the AIC Funds and the Closed-End Funds.

	REQUESTED RELIEF







	Accordingly, Applicants respectfully request an Order of the Commission, subject to the terms set forth in the Application, pursuant to Sections 17(d) and 57(i) and Rule 17d-l to permit any of the AIC
	Funds, the Closed-End Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds to enter into Co-Investment Transactions with each other.

	differ in detail as a result of circumstances and structures being different for each applicant, Applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions for the relief
	requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders. We note, in particular, that the co-investment protocol to be followed by the Applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by
	Medley Capital Corporation and its affiliates, for which an order was granted on March 26, 2012 (the


	Medley Order


	);



	19



	to the extent the requested relief varies from the Medley Order, the variations reflect the specific business
	necessities of Apollo Global Management, the AIC Funds and the Affiliated Funds, as well as the greater complexity of their organization in general.



	20



	Applicants believe, however, that the relief requested herein is consistent with the policy underlying the Medley
	Order as well as co-investment relief granted by the Commission to other BDCs and to registered closed-end funds.



	 






	III.







	STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF RELIEF REQUESTED








	In accordance with Rule 17d-1 (made applicable to persons subject to Sections 57(c) and (d), as modified by Rule 57b-1, by Section 57(i)), the Commission may grant the requested relief as to any
	particular joint transaction if it finds that the participation of the Investors (or any person they control) in the joint transaction is consistent with the



	 








	19

	 







	See

	note 18,

	supra

	.











	20

	 







	The Medley Platform includes two affiliated advisers of the BDCs adviser and four existing funds that are prohibited from completing joint
	transactions with the BDC, whereas in the Apollo platform there are over 30 Affiliated Advisers and over 50 Existing Affiliated Funds.







	 




	23







	provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. Applicants submit that allowing the Co-investment
	Transactions described by this Application is justified on the basis of (i) the potential benefits to the Investors and the shareholders thereof and (ii) the protections found in the Conditions.




	As required by Rule 17d-1(b), the Conditions ensure that the terms on which Co-Investment Transactions may be made will be
	consistent with the participation of the Investors being on a basis that it is neither different from nor less advantageous than other participants, thus protecting the equity holders of any participant from being disadvantaged. The Conditions will
	ensure that all Co-Investment Transactions are reasonable and fair to the Investors and their shareholders and do not involve overreaching by any person concerned, including the Investor Advisers.



	 





	 





	A.






	POTENTIAL BENEFITS







	In the absence of the relief sought hereby, in many circumstances the Investors would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Section 17(d),
	Section 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d-1 should not prevent BDCs and registered closed-end investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders.




	Each Investor and its shareholders will benefit from the ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions. The Board,
	including the Independent Directors, or Independent Party, as applicable, of each Investor has determined that it is in the best interests of the Investor to participate in Co-Investment Transactions because, among other matters, (i) the
	Investor should be able to participate in a larger number and greater variety of transactions; (ii) the Investor should be able to participate in larger




	 




	24







	transactions; (iii) the Investor should be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a Required Majority or otherwise permissible under the Order rather than risk underperformance
	through rotational allocation of opportunities among the Investors; (iv) the Investor and any other Investors participating in the proposed investment should have greater bargaining power, more control over the investment and less need to bring
	in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different needs of external investors; (v) the Investor should be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment bankers and others who act as sources of
	investments; and (vi) the Conditions are fair to the Investors and their shareholders.



	 





	 







	B.






	PROTECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS







	The Conditions ensure that the proposed Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Investors shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of
	the Act. Specifically, the Conditions incorporate the following critical protections: (i) in each Co-Investment Transaction, all Investors participating in the Co-Investment Transactions will invest at the same time (except that the settlement
	date for an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur up to 15 business days after the settlement date for the Investor, and vice versa) for the same price and with the same terms, conditions, class, registration rights and any other
	rights, so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other; (ii) a Required Majority, or the Independent Party, as applicable, of each Investor must approve various investment decisions with respect to such Investor in accordance
	with the Conditions; and (iii) the Investors are required to retain and maintain certain records.




	 




	25







	Other than pro rata Follow-On Transactions as provided in conditions 8 and
	9, and after making the determinations required in conditions 2 and 3(a), the Investor Advisers will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, and the
	Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Investor. With respect to the pro rata Follow-On Transactions provided in conditions 8 and 9, an Investor
	may participate in a pro rata Follow-On Transaction without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, if, among other things: (i) the proposed participation of each Investor and any Affiliated Fund
	in such Follow-On Transaction is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the securities that are the subject of the Follow-On Transaction immediately preceding the Follow-On Transaction; and (ii) the Board or Independent Party, as
	applicable, of the Investor has approved that Investors participation in pro rata Follow-On Transactions generally as being in the best interests of the Investor. If the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, does not approve such pro rata
	participation, any such Follow-On Transaction will be submitted for consideration to the Investors Eligible Directors. The Board of any Investor may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata Follow-On Transactions with
	the result that all Follow-On Transactions by that Investor must be submitted to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable.




	Applicants believe that participation by the Investors in pro rata Follow-On Transactions, as provided in conditions 8 and 9, is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and will
	not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata Follow-On Transactions, eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation




	 




	26







	determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness. Applicants note that the Commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of
	Rule 23c-2, which relates to the redemption by a closed-end investment company of less than all of a class of its securities, indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides.




	In sum, the Applicants believe that the Conditions would ensure that each Investor that participates in a Co-Investment
	Transaction does not participate on a basis different from (except that the settlement date for an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur up to 15 business days after the settlement date for the Investor, and vice versa), or less
	advantageous than, that of such other participants. As a result, Applicants believe that the participation of the Investors in Co-Investment Transactions done in accordance with the Conditions would be consistent with the provisions, policies,
	and purposes of the Act, and would be done in a manner that was not different from, or less advantageous than, the other participants.



	 






	IV.







	CONDITIONS








	Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:



	21







	1. The Advisers will maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that each Investor Adviser is notified of all Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within the then-current
	Objectives and Strategies of any Investor the Investor Adviser manages and that are considered by any investment committee of the Advisers.



	 








	21

	 






	The Conditions do not apply to AIC Funds vis-à-vis other AIC Funds because such funds can enter into Co-Investment Transactions with each other without violating
	Section 57(a)(4) pursuant to Rule 57b-1.






	 




	27







	2. When an Investor Adviser is notified of a Potential Co-Investment Transaction that falls
	within an Investors then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Investor Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the Investor in light of the Investors then-current circumstances.



	 





	 




	3.      (a)




	If the Investor Adviser deems an Investors participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Investor, it will then determine an
	appropriate level of investment for the Investor.





	 





	 




	(b)




	If the aggregate amount recommended by the Investor Adviser to be invested in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction by the participating Investors and any
	participating Affiliated Fund(s), collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the amount of the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on the amount that each such party would
	have invested if the amount of the investment opportunity was sufficient to satisfy each partys proposed investment.





	 





	 




	(c)




	After making the determinations required in conditions 2 and 3(a) above, the Investor Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each Investor and each participating Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors or the Independent Party, as applicable, of each participating Investor for their consideration. An Investor
	will co-invest with one or more other Investors or Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Investors participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction a Required Majority, or the Independent Party, as applicable, concludes that:





	 





	 




	(i)




	the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Investor and its equity holders and do not involve overreaching in
	respect of the Investor or its equity holders on the part of any person concerned;






	 




	28









	 




	(ii)




	the transaction is consistent with:





	 





	 




	(A)




	the interests of the Investors equity holders; and





	 





	 




	(B)




	the Investors then-current Objectives and Strategies;





	 





	 




	(iii)




	the investment by any other Investor(s) or Affiliated Fund(s) would not disadvantage the Investor, and participation by the Investor would not be on a basis different
	from (except that the settlement date for another Investor or an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur subsequent to the settlement date for the Investor, and vice versa, although it will occur as soon as practicable and in no
	event more than 15 business days thereafter) or less advantageous than that of any other Investor(s) or Affiliated Fund(s);

	provided

	, that if any other Investor or Affiliated Fund, but not the Investor itself, gains the right to nominate a
	director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors, the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event will not be interpreted to prohibit
	the Required Majority, or the Independent Party, as applicable, from reaching the conclusions required by this condition 3(c)(iii), if:





	 





	 




	(A)




	the Eligible Directors, or the Independent Party, as applicable, will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any,






	 




	29









	 




	(B)




	the Investor Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Investors Board, or the Independent Party, as applicable, with respect to the actions of
	such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and





	 





	 




	(C)




	any fees or other compensation that any other Investor or Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any other Investor or Affiliated Fund receives in connection with
	the right of another Investor or an Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among any participating
	Affiliated Funds (who may, in turn, share their portion with their affiliated persons) and the participating Investor(s) in accordance with the amount of each such partys investment; and





	 





	 




	(iv)





	the proposed investment by the Investor will not involve compensation or remuneration to any Adviser (other than one controlled by an Investor) or any
	Affiliated Fund or the other Investors or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the







	 




	30









	 




	parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 14, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) or 57(k), as applicable,
	(C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 3(c)(iii)(C).






	4. Each Investor has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount
	proposed.




	5. Each Investor Adviser will present to the Board, or the Independent Party, as applicable, of each Investor, on a
	quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Investors then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made
	available to the Investor, and an explanation of why such investment opportunities were not made available to the Investor. All information presented to Investors Board, or the Independent Party, as applicable, pursuant to this condition will
	be kept for the life of the Investor and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.




	6. Except for Follow-On Transactions made in accordance with condition 9 below, an Investor will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which (i) Apollo Global Management, any other
	Investor or any Affiliated Fund is an existing investor, (ii) any person described in Section 57(b) (other than by reason of the reference in Section 57(b)(2) to Section 2(a)(3)(D) insofar as certain Affiliated Funds are
	structured as partnerships) in relation to such Investor (treating any registered closed-end fund as a BDC for this purpose) that the Investor Adviser knows or reasonably should know is an existing investor, or (iii) any person described in
	Section 57(e) in relation to such Investor that the Investor Adviser knows is an existing investor.




	 




	31







	7. An Investor will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the
	terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date (except that the settlement date for another Investor or an Affiliated Fund in a Co-Investment Transaction may occur subsequent to the settlement date for the Investor,
	and vice versa, although it will occur as soon as practicable thereafter and in no event more than 15 business days after) and registration rights (if any) will be the same for each participating Investor and Affiliated Fund. The grant to another
	Investor or an Affiliated Fund, but not the Investor, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the
	governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 7, if conditions 3(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.



	 





	 




	8.      (a)




	If any Investor or Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a transaction that would be considered a Follow-On Transaction, the
	Investor Adviser will:






	(i) notify each Investor that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction or
	Non-Negotiated Transaction that preceded the proposed Follow-On Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and




	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Investor in the disposition.



	 





	 




	(b)




	Each Investor will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those
	applicable to any participating Affiliated Funds and any other Investor.






	 




	32









	 




	(c)




	An Investor may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority, or Independent Party, as applicable, if: (i) the
	proposed participation of each Investor and Affiliated Fund holding the securities in question in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in such security immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board or
	Independent Party, as applicable, of the Investor has generally approved as being in the best interests of the Investor the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the Application); and
	(iii) the Board or Independent Party, as applicable, of the Investor is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Investor Adviser will provide its written
	recommendation as to the Investors participation to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, and the Investor will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority or Independent Party, as
	applicable, determines that it is in the Investors best interests.





	 





	 




	(d)




	Each Investor and each Affiliated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.





	 





	 




	9.      (a)




	If any Investor or Affiliated Fund desires to complete a transaction that would be considered a Follow-On Transaction, other than dispositions subject to condition 8
	above, the Investor Adviser will:






	(i) notify each Investor that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction
	or Non-Negotiated Transactions that preceded the proposed Follow-On Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and




	 




	33







	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of
	the proposed investment, by the Investor;



	 





	 




	(b)




	An Investor may participate in such Follow-On Transaction without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, if:
	(i) the proposed participation of each Investor and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding holding of the security in question of the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Transaction; and (ii) the
	Board or Independent Party, as applicable, of the Investor has approved as being in the best interests of the Investor the ability to participate in Follow-On Transactions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this Application). In
	all other cases, the Investor Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Investors participation to the Eligible Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, and the Investor will participate in such Follow-On Transaction
	solely to the extent that a Required Majority or Independent Party, as applicable, determines that it is in the Investors best interests.






	 




	34









	 




	(c)




	If, with respect to any Follow-On Transaction:






	(i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Investors and the Affiliated Funds outstanding holdings of the security in question immediately preceding the Follow-On Transaction; and




	(ii) the aggregate amount of participation recommended by the Investor Adviser for each Investor in such
	Follow-On Transaction, together with the amount of participation proposed for any Affiliated Funds in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the Follow-On Transaction opportunity, the amount of the Follow-On Transaction opportunity will be
	allocated among them pro rata based on the amount of participation that each such party would have had if the amount of the opportunity was sufficient to satisfy each partys proposed participation, subject to modification by an allocation
	committee, as discussed in the Application.




	(d) Participation in a Follow-On Transaction as permitted by this condition will
	be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in this application, including conditions 2 and 3.




	10. The Independent Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, of each Investor will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment
	Transactions, including investments made by Affiliated Funds that the Investor considered but declined to participate in, so that the Independent Directors or Independent Party, as applicable, may determine whether all investments made in Potential
	Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the Investor considered but declined to participate in, comply with the Conditions. In addition, the Independent Directors and
	each Independent Party will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Investor of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.




	 




	35







	11. Each Investor will maintain the records required by Section 57(f)(3) as if each of
	the Co-Investment Transactions permitted under the Conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f).




	12. No Independent Director of an Investor will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise be an
	affiliated person (as defined in the Act) of any Affiliated Fund.




	13. The expenses, if any, associated with
	acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not
	payable by Advisers under their respective advisory agreements with the Investors and the Affiliated Funds, be shared by the Investors and the participating Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or being
	acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.




	14. Any transaction fee (including break-up, structuring, monitoring or
	commitment fees but excluding brokers fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k), and agency or similar fees payable to a party acting as agent (or in a similar role) in respect of an investment) received in connection with any
	Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participants on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending
	consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1), and the account will earn a competitive rate




	 




	36







	of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participants based on the amount they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers or any
	affiliated person of the Affiliated Funds or the Investors will receive any additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (i) in the case of the Investors and
	the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 3(c)(iii)(C), (ii) brokers fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k), as applicable, or (iii) in the
	case of the Advisers and their affiliates, investment advisory, administrative



	22



	and ancillary compensation paid in accordance with investment advisory, administrative and similar agreements between the applicable Investor(s) or Affiliated Fund(s) and its Adviser or an affiliated
	person thereof, and agency fees paid in accordance with agency or similar agreements.



	 








	22

	 






	Administrative compensation refers to the administrative and operational services compensation paid pursuant to agreements by and between the applicable
	Investor(s) or Affiliated Fund(s) and its Adviser or an affiliated person thereof for services provided by such adviser or affiliated person.
