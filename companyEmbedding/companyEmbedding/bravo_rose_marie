Rose Marie Bravo (born January 13, 1951 in the Bronx, New York)[1] is an American businesswoman. During her career, she has occupied leadership positions in several major fashion businesses and is now vice chairman at Burberry, of which she was CEO from 1997 to 2005.
Bravo, whose Italian-born father owned a hairdressing business in the New York Bronx, attended the elite public Bronx High School of Science and went on to study English literature at Fordham University.[2] She graduated cum laude and joined Abraham and Straus' department store at Long Island as a buyer in 1971. In 1974, she was recruited by Macy's. When her company bought I. Magnin she continued to work there until the bankrupt of Macy's in 1992. After five more years as President and Chief Merchant of Saks Fifth Avenue, Burberry chose to appoint her as a chief executive.
In her new job she initiated a radical reform of the British classic brand and improvements of the company structure. Her strategy included signing top model Kate Moss and recruiting the young designer Christopher Bailey (fashion designer) in 2001, who was working for Gucci at that time.[3] The Burberry line of products was greatly increased and especially the newly added perfumes contributed to the company's raising profits.
With Bravo as a CEO, Burberry managed to expand greatly on the US market. The company's sales doubled from 470 million to 1 billion USD.[2] The same happened to the profits, e. g. in the six months before September 30, 2003 they increased to a total of 115 million USD.[4]
In recognition of her work, she earned a reputation of being one of the top female business people. For instance, New York's Wall Street Journal listed her in its 2004 top 50 hall of fame,[5] Fortune Magazine ranked her #13 in its 2004 and 2005 lists of "The 50 most Powerful Women in Business" outside the US.[6]
In 2005, Burberry announced Bravo would step down for Angela Ahrendts (formerly Liz Claiborne). After a 6 months transitional period, Bravo retired as a CEO and became vice chairman of Burberry.

Rose Marie Bravo


                    Burberry
                




January 12, 2004, 12:00 AM EST








 
        
         
      
      
                
          
          
          
          
          
      
      
      
              When Rose Marie Bravo traded in one of the most prestigious jobs in retail to head ailing British retailer Burberry Group PLC six years ago, even her parents had doubts about her choice. As president of Saks Inc., owner of Saks Fifth Avenue stores, Bravo ran a flourishing operation from plush Manhattan offices. Burberry's, on the other hand, was then based in a downtrodden part of East London above the company's raincoat factory. The 147-year-old brand, best known for its trademark beige, red, and black plaid-lined trench coats, had lost much of its cachet. "They said, 'You're leaving Fifth Avenue for this?"' recalls Bravo, 52, a native New Yorker.   
       
      
       
          
        
      
      
Bravo quickly changed all that. She hired some of the best creative, financial, and marketing brains in the business. After poaching up-and-coming designer Christopher Bailey from Gucci Group (GUC
      ) PLC, the new team pored over the brand's archives looking for ways  to tap into its rich history. Today, Burberry is achingly hip. Ads featuring supermodel Kate Moss redefined its image. And  four years ago, Burberry came out with plaid bikinis. That quickly turned into a cult item that brought a younger generation to  the label.

Updated versions of Burberry classics such as this season's $1,095 fuchsia trench are must-haves for fashionistas. And Bravo's expansion into higher-margin accessories, fragrances, and baby wear are powering sales. Operating profits doubled to $115 million on revenues of $554 million during the six months ended Sept. 30, 2003. It's no wonder "doing a Burberry" is the aspiration of fading luxury brands worldwide.





Key Accomplishments

-- Successful growth in the U.S. and expansion into higher-margin accessories and baby wear helped double operating profits to  $115 million in six months ended Sept. 30.
-- Launched Burberry Brit perfume line, which should produce $100 million sales in its first year.

Leadership: Retail Legend Shares Her Secrets to Success
July 17th, 2012 in Leadership by Roger O. Crockett


Rose Marie Bravo is the former CEO and Vice Chairman of Burberry Group Plc. Currently, she is a member of the Board of Directors of Tiffany & Co., Estée Lauder Cos. and Williams-Sonoma, which she joined in 2011. Bravo blazed a trail in the retail industry during the 1980s and ‘90s. She held a number of positions at R.H. Macy & Co., culminating as Chairman and CEO of subsidiary I. Magnin from 1987 to 1992. Her success there helped her land the job as President of luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue with responsibility for merchandising, marketing and product development. Then in 1997 she became CEO of Burberry, where she oversaw a bold reform of the British classic brand, expanding the line of products and boosting sales and profits in the process.
Her vast experience and success in retail is precisely the reason Bravo sits on as many boards as she does. We talked about how to excel on a board, about women in leadership, and of course, about retail. After all, (and she’ll bristle at this moniker) Bravo is something like the queen of luxury retail. The nice thing, however, is that she doesn’t act like it. Her commitment to hard work showed during our taping. As much as any executive interviewed for our leadership series, Bravo wanted to get things right, no matter the time it took. It helped that she was camera friendly—with a ready smile, plenty of wits and that good ol’ Bronx-neighborhood charm.
For a glimpse of Rose Marie Bravo’s views on leadership, watch the video interview by clicking the video box, or read the transcript that follows.
An Edited Transcript
CHAPTER 1:  A CEO AND HER BOARD – LEVERAGING THE RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE BETTER LEADERS.
Roger Crockett:  How can the board help the CEO be successful, and how can the board help in the development of high potential management?
Rose Marie Bravo:  Well, a board can be immensely valuable if a CEO and management team know how to use the board.  The board members are there to add value. And on the boards that I have been on and that I have observed, there’s a great deal of expertise around the table on various subjects.  So you have a variety of expertise and it’s up to the CEO and the chairman to be the sort of band leader, and to figure out how to utilize the best of the talents that they have around that table.
Roger Crockett:  Okay.  Well, give me a couple of examples.  I know that on some of your boards you said there had been programs and panels put in place.  Talk a little bit about those.
Rose Marie Bravo:  Most recently, I’ve been involved with Williams-Sonoma’s leadership team and they asked two or three of the board members to meet with them to talk about our successes, and yes, our failures.  We were asked what are some of the things we learned as we were running companies? What are some of the things we wanted to pass on to new leaders, and what we thought was important in a leader?  We have a wonderful program at Estée Lauder called Semper Novus and it means ‘Always New’. Leonard Lauder, our Chairman Emeritus, believes that one executive must always be learning.  Everything has to always be new because the business we’re in is forever changing and is transformational.  So his mantra is, “How do we keep the executive team always learning and exploring the nuances of all the various aspects of the business that one is involved in?”  So he has a program that is run by Phoebe Port, whereby they bring in executives from all around the world, and they invite board members to attend just because they believe so much in leadership.  I think it’s a wonderful program.
CHAPTER 2: “ADDING VALUE AS A DIRECTOR TAKES MORE TIME THAN IT USED TO.”
Roger Crockett:  Now that makes it obvious that the time commitment required from a board member is much different today than it was maybe a few years ago.  Talk a bit about how much time is required, and why it’s changing in corporate America.
Rose Marie Bravo:  I’ve seen the board meetings themselves really evolve, and they’ve stretched in most cases now to almost two full days when you get done with the committees and the executive sessions.  Some of it is due to the good governance practices that we have to deal with. So time is needed to follow up on some of the regulations to make sure that we are doing all the things we are supposed to be doing.  Then you have the actual business of the business.  In a couple of these cases, Estée Lauder and Williams-Sonoma, the companies own multiple brands. So even getting a board to be familiar with all the different brands in terms of presentations, that takes up a lot more time.
At a company like Tiffany that is burgeoning in Asia and other places around the world, you have, all of a sudden, international issues that maybe ten years ago didn’t exist.  Now in almost every board meeting you have a session on China, the importance of China as a market, the importance of the Chinese consumer, the importance of the Chinese consumer who travels into duty free outlets, the importance of Chinese consumers in Europe – whether shopping in Paris, shopping in London, or shopping in Berlin.  This has changed the whole complexity of learning for the board, to keep them up to speed.  Now we’re asking the board to add value on some of the experiences they might have with some of these [international] markets.  Also, technology has changed everything for us.
Roger Crockett:  How so?
Rose Marie Bravo:  So now you have e-commerce, now you have Pinterest, now you have Twitter meetings, Facebook meetings, and you’re talking now about social media as another major topic, which if you go back even five years, didn’t exist.  So I think it’s more complex, it takes more time.  And I find that the (board) materials you get in advance, which maybe years ago came in a smaller books, now come in a big stack, But of course, they are all on the iPad.  You have material that has to be read.  You have to take time.  If you have a question about the material, you have to take the time to inquire about that.  Then you have the board meeting itself.  Then you have the post meeting because the meeting itself raises questions and issues that you might want to think about, you might want to mull over, sleep over, and think, ‘well maybe this was a good idea, maybe it wasn’t, but what do they mean by this?’  ‘I want to call so-and-so to ask about this.’
CHAPTER 3: ON-THE-JOB EDUCATION FOR SITTING CEOS.
Roger Crockett:  Rose Marie, why is it important for CEOs to be on an outside board?
Rose Marie Bravo:  When I first became CEO of Burberry, I was asked to sit on the Tiffany board, and I thought to myself, ‘Oh, I am not going to want to do this, and my board isn’t going to let me do this because I am just going to be too busy just having taken this new role.’  My very foresighted chairman said to me, “You absolutely should do this.  This is a wonderful opportunity. You will learn immensely and it will add value to what you’re doing at Burberry.”  He was so right.  That was in 1997 and it helped me immensely because I was able to almost have a front seat watching a company go international, watching a company develop an e-commerce site from a catalogue business, watching how they developed their licensee arrangements with various categories of product, arrangements with franchise partners in places like the Middle East and Russia that were difficult to do business with on your own at that time.  So it gave me a window into a world as a new CEO.  I felt like I was learning, and probably they were giving me more value than I was giving them at that time.  But it was a wonderful learning experience.
CHAPTER 4: “KNOWING WHEN TO ZIP IT AND WHEN TO WEIGH IN.”
Roger Crockett:  Well, talk about what it takes to be a good director, a good board member.

Rose Marie Bravo:   You have to be interested in the business and in the company that you’re involved with.  And I think in short order you figure out where can you add value.  You try to say, “How is my experience relevant to that particular business, and given who else is there, where can I add value?” And I think being on a board sometimes means knowing when to zip it and also knowing when you can contribute.  You may be the authority on a particular subject versus maybe other subjects where you have a point of view, but you may not be as informed as somebody else.
I mentioned Estée Lauder and their incredible leadership program, and Fabrizio Freda’s  mantra: He calls it ‘Leading from every chair’.  He’s come up with this little cheat sheet. He talks about things like thinking strategically, engaging the team in the vision, embracing change, developing talent, energizing others, building collaborative relationships, demonstrating agility, driving creativity and innovation, striving for excellence and having high touch leadership competencies.  I thought, ‘What a great little bible for a board member’ because all of these are areas that we, as board members, are supposed to care about: talent, strategy, vision, the plan and approving the plan, and of course, following good governance.  But beyond all of that, these are really things that are additive to a company management team if a board member is really engaged in some of these very important points.
CHAPTER 5: TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN.
Roger Crockett:  You mentioned Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder has a person who is the CEO and another person who is the non-executive chairman.  That is becoming more of a trend, splitting those roles.  What is important about splitting or not splitting those roles?
Rose Marie Bravo:  That was a very new concept to me when I became the CEO of Burberry because in the UK it is mandatory to have a chairman and a CEO. They split the roles. All public companies have the split role.  Split roles was unheard of, in my experience, but I found it to be excellent for me.  It worked for me very well.  I had two different chairmen during my nine-year tenure with Burberry, both of whom were very different, who had very different skills. And both of whom were extremely additive to the value equation at the company.  I think it’s like any other thing a good CEO does. You think about how to utilize the resources that are available to you. I always looked at, even though I was reporting to the chairman, I always looked at the chairman as working for me.  How can I use this chairman, this person with so much expertise in fields and areas that I really may not be as knowledgeable about.  In both cases they were male, and I found that I developed this concept of delegating upwards, because there were areas that I felt that, “Gosh, I don’t have time to do some of this other work.”  It could be working with the City.  It could be reviewing investor relations conversations. My second chairman there was an expert, John Peace, in dealing with the City because he had been a CEO of a FTSE 100 company. So he knew the ins and outs of the City.
I figured out that my value added was more in the product and the merchandising and the marketing.  If I could spend my time doing that, and he helped me in an additive way, running the board, doing so many other roles that he was able to do for me, I was going to be more effective.  I think one of the things you hit upon earlier, Roger, is how complex it is today to be a CEO.  There isn’t a day that goes by that there is not another article in the newspaper about a CEO wanting to get out, being thrown out, staying too long, or adding different roles.  Every day, it’s like the big topic.  You ask yourself why it’s become so much more complex than it was, say, five, ten, fifteen years ago.  Having this dual role, I think, is meaningful and especially if the personalities conjive.  You mentioned Estée Lauder: with William Lauder as chairman you had Fabrizio Freda as CEO. Their assets, their strengths very much compensate for one another.  They are able to go on to different subjects.  I am now watching at Williams-Sonoma Adrian Bellamy, who’s the chairman and Laura Alber who is the CEO.  The learnings for her include having a chairman who’s been a CEO of a global company and was a chairman of Gucci group before that. This is a lot of experience and expertise that’s brought to the table.  I think a wise CEO can just take advantage of all that knowledge.
CHAPTER 6: “CEOS IN RETAIL TODAY NEED TO EAT THEIR WHEATIES.”
Roger Crockett:  The environment, for retail especially, has changed so dramatically over the years.  How has that affected the competencies needed for CEOs to manage well?
Rose Marie Bravo:  I think CEOs in retail really have to take their Wheaties because you’re 24/7 now.  The retail landscape is so competitive.  When I think back to when I was beginning my career in retail at Macy’s versus the complexity of what you deal with now—from Amazon.com to Target to Saks Fifth Avenue to designer boutiques—you’re getting competition from every part of the world. I think that has added complexity to the business and to the landscape.  Of course, a part of the whole e-commerce conversation in those companies like Williams-Sonoma and Tiffany was that they had catalogue businesses.  I think it was easier for them to go into e-commerce than maybe somebody like Burberry that didn’t have a catalogue business at that time.  We didn’t even have mail order.  We didn’t even have warehousing for mail order and for catalogue. So people like Estée Lauder that had some catalogue business, they were able then to transform that into e-commerce.  Certainly Williams-Sonoma was a great example of going very easily into e-commerce, and now direct-to-consumer represents a big part of their total business.  I think it added to the complexity of what a role of the CEO is in today’s world.
Roger Crockett:  Does that necessarily mean, though, that the CEO must bring to the table experience in digital media and social media, in technology? Or can they just have fundamental management skills?
Rose Marie Bravo:  I think you need fundamental, good management skills first. And you need good leadership skills that we talked about earlier.  I think that you’re going to want expertise for sure in e-commerce and social media, whether you get from your board, whether it’s from the head of marketing, or you actually bring somebody on board as Williams-Sonoma has just done by bringing the head of marketing from Google onto their board to get that technology know-how.  There’s different ways around it.  I think to think that one CEO, one human being, is going to be able to possess everything that is necessary to be a great retail CEO is a fallacy. I think it’s about building the team and having a strong CFO and COO.  In the case of the dual leadership roles, the chairman and splitting the roles of CEO, I come from the merchant line, I come from the product line, so I think for a retail CEO not to have been immersed in merchandising, product, stores, that’s hard.  I am not saying it’s impossible, but I think today you want somebody that knows your product because after all, nothing happens in retail until a customer buys something. So you need to have some understanding of the product and what it’s about, and how to drive that dream that you’re selling.
CHAPTER 7: REQUIRED EXPERTISE, IN THE BOARD ROOM AND THE C-SUITE.
Roger Crockett:  Well you mention the board – Is there a new profile for a good board or good Director?
Rose Marie Bravo:  I think that a lot of the nominating committees that I sit on really spend a lot of time developing the areas of expertise that one must have on the board.  At Estée Lauder, one of the things they felt passionately about, particularly the nominating committee and Lynn de Rothschild, was that we needed to have Asian representation. She went very far to find Wei Christianson, who came on to the board from China. She was living in Shanghai, and believe it or not, was able to make the commitment of attending the board meetings.  So that’s been invaluable.  But it depends on the board.  I mentioned Williams-Sonoma.  They absolutely wanted to have somebody come on from e-commerce.  They felt they needed social media and more understanding in e-commerce.  So they have the Google person.
Tiffany just brought on Robert Singer who’s coming from many experiences, but he was the COO and CFO of Gucci. That was a case where it was felt that we needed more luxury experience.  I think boards and probably nominating committees are spending a lot of time scrutinizing the backgrounds of what they have, who may be getting close to retirement, who’s going to be going off the board, and then what are the talents that we want to bring into the company.  I think, at the top of everyone’s list, of course, is international experience.  People are craving that.  Not just on boards, but even for executive talent.  Having lived elsewhere, having lived in another part of the country, having lived in another part of the world, this is the big asset.  I would say to young people who are in the process of building their career, that if they get an opportunity to move, to relocate, to live in another part of the world, even another part of the country, I would grab it.  I would grab it because I think having that is a very important asset to have in your bag of tricks.
CHAPTER 8: WOMEN, BOARDS AND GOOD LEADERSHIP.
Roger Crockett:  Estée Lauder has done a tremendous job in terms of having a number of women on its board, but other companies haven’t done as good as job.  How do we get more women in leadership roles in corporate America?
Rose Marie Bravo: I’m so glad you mentioned Estée Lauder. Of course, the company was founded by a woman, and had women such as Carol Phillips, in probably almost half their brands actually running billions of dollars worth of businesses individually as mini CEOs.  I think they were always a company that sort of understood it and from Leonard on down, I think you’ve had this feeling of supporting women. So when it came to the board and when Leonard was taking the company public and creating a board, he made sure this whole idea of balance on the board and diversity was present in every way.  Today, we have more women on the board than we do men.  We employ women in more than 70% of the staff around the world: Women running countries, women in legal counsel, women in HR, women in communications.  I think that the whole world is going this way, and understanding that there is a connection between the products they are selling and who the end consumer is and what the management of the company is and what the board reflects.
I do think that with this next generation we’re going to see a giant leap forward in terms of many women, especially in our country, getting to that CEO corner office.  It means making some sacrifices–and this is for males or females, anybody.  A person has to realize that stepping into that next level, it means they have to make sacrifices.

A Conversation with Rose Marie Bravo & Fabrizio Freda









Rose Marie Bravo & Fabrizio Feda at the 21 Club
Photo credit: E. Bruce Borner



Fashion Group International (http://www.fgi.org/) held  "The Tastemakers" Breakfast & Conversation yesterday morning. The sold out event featured a sit down breakfast at the iconic 21 Club, followed by a conversation with Rose Marie Bravo, CBE Retail Brand Consultant, and Fabrizio Freda, CEO Estee Lauder Companies. Following the delicious breakfast, FGI President Margaret Hayes introduced the dynamic pair (both are legends within business circles for sure), and recited their impressive resumes (not that we needed to be reminded of course).  Rose Marie Bravo is the former CEO and Vice Chairman of Burberry Group Plc. She is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Tiffany & Co., Estée Lauder Cos. and Williams-Sonoma, which she joined in 2011. 

Bravo blazed a trail in the retail industry during the 1980s and 1990s. She held a number of positions at R.H. Macy & Co., culminating as Chairman and CEO of subsidiary I. Magnin from 1987 to 1992. Her success there helped her land the job as President of luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue with responsibility for merchandising, marketing and product development. Then in 1997 she became CEO of Burberry, where she oversaw a bold reform of the British classic brand, expanding the line of products and boosting sales and profits in the process. Mr. Fabrizio Freda has been the Chief Executive Officer of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., since July 1, 2009 and its President since March 2008. Mr. Freda served as the Chief Operating Officer at The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. from March 2008 to July 1, 2009. Mr. Freda served as the President of Global Snacks at Procter & Gamble Company from 2001 to February 2008. 
 While I have met Ms. Bravo in the past (and in fact, she was the subject of one of our Masters of Fashion Interviews, conducted by Grace Mirabella), I have never had the pleasure or meeting Mr. Freda, who showed himself to be wise, witty, and humble (and, THE perfect boss, I might add) during the informative and entertaining several hours.



These are the 
highlights:



Ms. Bravo (RMB): What were 
the challenges when you first started?"Fabrizio Freda (FF): "I didn't expect to find the 
strength that I did. In 2008 it looked like the world was collapsing. There's 
nothing like a big crisis to make you re-think business".



RMB: "How 
did you get everyone integrated and working together"?



FF: 
"Learning to share knowledge was THE challenge. As well as creating a team of 
people, creating a new strategy, and one common vision. We are collaborative; a 
company of very distinctive brands"



 RMB: "How do 
you keep the vision fresh?"



FF: "The 
vision is THE single most important thing in any company. It's all about how you 
form a vision today. You have to know where you want to go and what to do to get 
there. It's all about the compass: the next 10 years. What the picture of 
the future will look like 10 years from now. Reverse engineering is what we have 
to do. It's all about determining the future and then reverse. Reverse 
engineering makes it happen".



 Ms. Bravo 
noted that they both share an Italian heritage, where family is key. She started 
talking about the idea of family values and how important that element is in 
business.



FF: "Yes, my 
Italian experience teaches you to lead, and it has helped in making things 
happen. Italy is very challenging. You know the song "New York, New York" and 
the line, "If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"? Well, I think, 
"If you can make it in Napoli, you can make it anywhere" (this got a lot of 
laughs and having traveled to Naples, where Mr. Freda was born, I understand 
exactly what he means). 

 

Ms. Bravo 
spoke of the famed Lauder Family, and their "amazing values".



FF: "Yes, I 
value that the Lauder Family is a blue-chip family. They are passionate and have 
an obsession with quality".



"Leonard 
(Lauder) always reminds us: "My name is on the door" (this got laughs as 
well).



"Family companies are 
investing in the future and are much more for the long term. There's an 
obsession for the long term''.



 Then Ms. 
Bravo, who is a board member of Estee Lauder, recalls her first encounter with 
Mr. Freda at a board meeting that was held at Vassar College. They shared 
memories and laughs about the cozy, coed dorm - like living 
situation.

 
FF: 
"Meeting the board members in shorts is a challenging moment" he joked. "Can you 
imagine that the first time meeting my board members, it  was early in the 
morning and I was wearing shorts?"



 He recalled 
seeing Vassar's motto which was emblazoned in front of the school, "Semper 
Novis" which means, "always new" and related how that held a lot of symbolism 
for his company. "It's something that must always be kept in the minds of those 
who work in a company. But the wisdom and challenge for the leader of a company, 
is to have the wisdom to decide what to change and what to accept, and that is a 
key point for management."



 

Ms. Bravo 
recalled that challenge when she first took over as CEO of Burberry, quickly 
turning the iconic British company into a global fashion mega 
brand. "At 
Burberry, I was labeled a workaholic. How do you balance your life and encourage 
balance in the workplace?"



FF: "The key secret? 
Take care of your health, get good nutrition, and manage your 
energy".



"At some 
point, we have to take a break from work and take care of our selves". "Take 
your time, organize your day, and take your holidays. I separate work time from 
family and holiday time".



RB: "What 
about the importance of (ethnic and gender) diversity"? 



FF: "Diversity is the 
strength. It's important to create teams that collaborate and to leverage 
strength. We work together and collaborate to create winning teams so we can 
win. Building on strength is important".



RMB: "How do you 
manage creative talent, and how does that lead to innovation?"



FF:  "Creativity is 
the sparkle of everything. Creativity is in everything and it is the key. We 
need to put creativity in the center of everything we do. Inspiring 
creativity is THE most important thing".



You need to identify 
and to know the biggest opportunities, and focus your attention on that. You 
have to create something the consumer doesn't know they want, but subsequently, 
cannot live without." 



 RMB: "A good merchant 
went with their guts in the old days. I didn't have a vision for Burberry until 
I got there. How important is branding and luxury?"



FF: "The 
world of luxury and branding is key. Image building at the top is key. We are 
selling experiences and entertainment, and not just a product". 



RMB: "What is a great 
leader?"



FF: "To be 
a great leader is all about having a vision. Leonard Lauder once said, "If you 
cannot see your future, you will never get here and you will never lead".



""If you don't see it, invent it. 
That's the definition of a good leader. And you have to inspire the others to 
get there. The leaders today have to set the vision and serve the organization 
and inspire leadership."."



RMB: "It's 
not lost on me that the new tagline at Estee Lauder is 'Be an inspiration' 
".



"What is the future of 
beauty? The world has changed!"



FF: "Beauty is the 
MOST exciting market of the future. Women are becoming wealthier and have more 
money to spend. Their three important things are food, fashion, and 
beauty."



RMB: "What is the best 
advice you ever got?"



FF: "The best advise I 
ever got from William (Lauder): Don't give me any solutions right away. Just 
listen, understand, and then create."



RMB: "My biggest 
failure in business is that I couldn't turn around I.Magnin, which I knew had so 
much potential, no what matter what I did. I learned a lot from that 
experience."



FF: "I always tell my 
people, "You have the right to fail". But I always say, "Fail fast and fail 
cheap!" (this got a lot of laughs)



At the end, members of 
the audience were invited to ask questions and someone inquired: "What 
are your goals for Estee Lauder?"

 

FF: "To keep it a high 
growth company. We are and want to continue to be the fastest growing company 
focused on prestige cosmetics". 



1 - "We want to bring 
prestige super high quality products; 2 - offer aspirational brands, and 3 - 
provide high tech services".



When a man 
observed that Proctor & Gamble (Mr. Freda's former company) has not been 
doing that well in the past few years , Mr. Freda quipped: "that's because I'm not there 
anymore".

About Me





Ernest Schmatolla


Lookonline.com is the longest publishing online fashion site in the world. It was launched first as a BBS service in 1993 and has been on the Internet since December 1994. The DFR: Daily Fashion report is also the first fashion blog and was started in early 2002 as the site's main news page. Before launching the site, I was for many years a New York fashion photographer.

Rose Marie Bravo (born January 13, 1951 in the Bronx, New York)[1] is an American businesswoman. During her career, she has occupied leadership positions in several major fashion businesses and is now vice chairman at Burberry, of which she was CEO from 1997 to 2005.
Bravo, whose Italian-born father owned a hairdressing business in the New York Bronx, attended the elite public Bronx High School of Science and went on to study English literature at Fordham University.[2] She graduated cum laude and joined Abraham and Straus' department store at Long Island as a buyer in 1971. In 1974, she was recruited by Macy's. When her company bought I. Magnin she continued to work there until the bankrupt of Macy's in 1992. After five more years as President and Chief Merchant of Saks Fifth Avenue, Burberry chose to appoint her as a chief executive.
In her new job she initiated a radical reform of the British classic brand and improvements of the company structure. Her strategy included signing top model Kate Moss and recruiting the young designer Christopher Bailey (fashion designer) in 2001, who was working for Gucci at that time.[3] The Burberry line of products was greatly increased and especially the newly added perfumes contributed to the company's raising profits.
With Bravo as a CEO, Burberry managed to expand greatly on the US market. The company's sales doubled from 470 million to 1 billion USD.[2] The same happened to the profits, e. g. in the six months before September 30, 2003 they increased to a total of 115 million USD.[4]
In recognition of her work, she earned a reputation of being one of the top female business people. For instance, New York's Wall Street Journal listed her in its 2004 top 50 hall of fame,[5] Fortune Magazine ranked her #13 in its 2004 and 2005 lists of "The 50 most Powerful Women in Business" outside the US.[6]
In 2005, Burberry announced Bravo would step down for Angela Ahrendts (formerly Liz Claiborne). After a 6 months transitional period, Bravo retired as a CEO and became vice chairman of Burberry.

The Power List
1. Rose Marie Bravo
By Kristina ZimbalistMonday, Feb. 09, 2004 




CHRIS SHIPMAN FOR TIME 


Turning Plaid Into Profits
That Rose Marie Bravo recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion  a fact she announces with an impassioned "Oh!" from her sofa on the 30th floor of the New York City offices of Burberry  is fitting. She has engaged in a grand-scale persuasion of her own of late that is widely considered a retail marvel.

Since being named chief executive of the British design house seven years ago, she has convinced the style elite that the dormant, 148-year-old brand  with its placid beige plaid, which had been spotted, if it was noticed at all, lining the raincoats on markdown racks  not only is no longer a fashion anathema but is in fact a status symbol. Her feat has more than doubled the company's sales, turning it from a $470 million-a-year enterprise to a $1 billion behemoth.

"I didn't quite know until I got there what I was going to uncover," says Bravo, 53. "It didn't take long to see that underneath the debris there was this beautiful, quality heritage. Of course, part of it was that the timing was right to restore. People were interested in it." The checks are now vaunted on ball gowns, bikinis and stilettos. There are fragrance and children's lines and sexy ad campaigns featuring chic Brits Kate Moss and Stella Tennant. The iconic trench coat, first designed in 1901 by Thomas Burberry as an army officer's raincoat, today comes in a panoply of styles, colors and prints, including this season's floral.

She dubs the transformation "doing what Gucci did, at Burberry," but Bravo was displaying corporation-altering prescience and chutzpah long before Tom Ford made them fashionable. As president of Saks in the '90s, she brought labels like Gucci, Jil Sander and Prada onto the selling floor, a move that began the store's return to the luxury league of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. As a cosmetics buyer at Macy's in the early '80s, Bravo noted the sudden proliferation of fuchsia in fashion. She called Carol Phillips, co-founder and then head of Clinique. "I said, 'This pink is wildly popular. It's everywhere in the clothing. We don't have a lipstick that color,'" Bravo recalls. Phillips called back to say a new lipstick would be in the line immediately. Bravo says her biggest break came in 1988 when Macy's promoted her from senior vice president of merchandising to chairman and chief executive of its new acquisition, the California-based chain I. Magnin.

If part of her intrepidity comes from growing up the daughter of a hairdresser who owned a salon in New York City's Bronx  Bravo attended the elite public Bronx High School of Science and Fordham University, also in the Bronx  the rest may result from the fact that early in her career, she saw "women in action." Says Bravo: "In cosmetics, which is where I particularly grew up, we had these wonderful role models. Estée Lauder, Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden are all women who created companies." Clinique's Phillips "hired all women," Bravo says. "Her top lieutenants were female. If you've been given this road map and you see that others have gone before you and achieved, you never have in your mind the notion of failure. You have the notion that you can do it too, if you're good enough and smart enough and make the right decisions."
