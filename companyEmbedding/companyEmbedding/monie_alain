Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Ingram Micro is a major tech player with a minor public profile - latimes

Advertisement


YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→BusinessSTOCK SPOTLIGHT Ingram Micro is a major tech player with a minor public profileThe Santa Ana firm is the ultimate middleman in the IT industry, connecting 1,300 manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung with hundreds of thousands of retailers.June 30, 2013|By Paresh Dave


Ingram Micro CEO Alain Monie took over the company in 2012 and has added new… (Gary Friedman, Los Angeles…)Standing between 1,300 product manufacturers and hundreds of thousands of retailers and businesses is Ingram Micro Inc., the world's largest wholesale distributor of computer hardware and software.The 34-year-old Santa Ana company buys technology products from such manufacturers as Microsoft Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Cisco Systems Inc., then sells them to retailers and other middlemen, which in turn sell the gadgets and the applications to consumers and small businesses.As the ultimate middleman in the $3.6-trillion information technology industry, Ingram is the place to go for thousands of U.S. and foreign resellers and retailers that find it much easier to restock their shelves by going to one source instead of 1,300 manufacturers."The value-added resellers rely on us to provide not only the hardware and software but also the logistic solutions," Ingram Micro Chief Executive Alain Monié said. "And the vendors don't have the ability to deal with this many buyers."Ingram Micro's roots go back to 1979, when Geza Csige and his wife, Lorraine Mecca, were hawking educational software. They left the company in the 1980s.A series of mergers and acquisitions propelled the company to global prominence, and it went public in 1996 at the leading edge of the dot-com boom. Since then, Ingram Micro's shares have remained in the $15-to-$20 range.Nearly a third of the products it sells comes from Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple Inc. Most of Ingram's sales are in North America and Europe, and 80% of its worldwide sales come from resellers, middlemen that sell to small businesses.The latestSince taking over in January 2012, Monié has added new services to match changing industry demands.He acquired a wireless device distributor and computing business, boosted the slate of cloud-computing services it offers and pitched Ingram as a mover of more than just tech gadgets. For a fee, the company now fulfills shipments for several major online retailers.In October, Ingram Micro acquired wireless device distributor BrightPoint Inc. for about $840 million.Monié said BrightPoint's appeal was that it did more than shuffle boxes. It also helped cellphone carriers with planning purchases, activating devices and tracking sales. With the acquisition, Ingram Micro should top $40 billion in revenue this year, analysts said.To eke out more profits, the company is expanding its higher-margin and less capital-intensive distribution service.Half of the boxes that pass through Ingram Micro's U.S. warehouses don't contain an IT product. Instead, Ingram is shipping such things as kayaks, teddy bears and pet food for companies that want to get their products out to consumers.AccomplishmentsIngram Micro was the first major IT distributor to reach $1 billion in sales, adopt bar codes on products and use laser-printed shipping labels, according to its website.The company has built a global sales and distribution network in North and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.The company reported a record $10.3 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter, which ended March 30.ChallengesMore manufacturers are cutting into the distribution business by selling directly to consumers and small businesses.But Monié said Ingram still has a leg up on competitors."We can work for manufacturers everywhere around the world, or they can go to 10 of our competitors to have the same distribution," he said.In emerging markets, such as Indonesia and Brazil, local upstarts with lower prices could crimp Ingram's growth. The company operates in 37 countries but sells in 160. Additional capital could help Ingram, and Monié wants to lift what he said is its undervalued stock within three years."Information technology distribution is seen as a business that doesn't have a lot of sex appeal," Monié said. "We're being valued as an industry of middlemen rather than as individual companies."Analyst viewsAnalysts find Monié's strategy encouraging. But they have short-term concerns about souring economic trends, including the slowdown in Asia and the lack of growth in Europe.Raymond Jones analyst Brian Alexander said Ingram has the potential to pivot with the tech industry. Cloud-computing providers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Rackspace US Inc. could eventually turn to Ingram to reach new customers, he said.paresh.dave@latimes.comTwitter: @peard33
