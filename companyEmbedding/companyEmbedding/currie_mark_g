NEW YORK, Dec. 13, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:  SGYPD, SGYPU), a developer of new drugs to treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and diseases, announced today that it has filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court against Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:  IRWD) and its Chief Scientific Officer and Senior VP of R&D, Dr. Mark G. Currie.  
The lawsuit alleges that after European patent 1,379,224 was granted to Synergy but prior to issuance, Ironwood and Dr. Currie opposed the patent before the European Patent Office and presented to the European Patent Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office, data and arguments that were false, contradictory, inaccurate and misleading.  In its complaint, Synergy accuses Ironwood and Dr. Currie of, among other things, unfair competition, fraud and unjust enrichment and seeks $500 million in actual and punitive damages.
About Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Synergy is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new drugs to treat gastrointestinal disorders and diseases. Synergy's proprietary drug candidate plecanatide is a synthetic analog of the human gastrointestinal hormone uroguanylin, and functions by activating the guanylate cyclase C receptor on epithelial cells of the GI tract. Synergy completed a Phase I study of plecanatide in healthy volunteers and a Phase IIa clinical trial in patients to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) patients. In October 2011, Synergy initiated dosing of patients in a major Phase II/III clinical trial of plecanatide in CIC patients. Plecanatide is also being developed to treat constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, with the first trial in IBS-C patients planned for 2012. Synergy's second GC-C agonist SP-333 is currently in pre-clinical development to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. More information is available at http://www.synergypharma.com.

TermDefinition
Drug PatentA drug patent is assigned by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and assigns exclusive legal right to the patent holder to protect the proprietary chemical formulation. The patent assigns exclusive legal right to the inventor or patent holder, and may include entities such as the drug brand name, trademark, product dosage form, ingredient formulation, or manufacturing process A patent usually expires 20 years from the date of filing, but can be variable based on many factors, including development of new formulations of the original chemical, and patent infringement litigation.
Drug ExclusivityExclusivity is the sole marketing rights granted by the FDA to a manufacturer upon the approval of a drug and may run simultaneously with a patent. Exclusivity periods can run from 180 days to seven years depending upon the circumstance of the exclusivity grant.
RLDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) is an approved drug product to which new generic versions are compared to show that they are bioequivalent. A drug company seeking approval to market a generic equivalent must refer to the Reference Listed Drug in its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).  By designating a single reference listed drug as the standard to which all generic versions must be shown to be bioequivalent, FDA hopes to avoid possible significant variations among generic drugs and their brand name counterpart.
