The Domini Funds are not insured and are subject to market risks, such as sector concentration and style risk. Investing internationally involves special risks, such as currency fluctuations, social and economic instability, differing securities regulations and accounting standards, limited public information, possible changes in taxation, and periods of illiquidity. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You may lose money.
The Domini Impact Bond Fund is not insured and is subject to market risks, including interest rate and credit risks. During periods of rising interest rates, bond funds can lose value. The Domini Impact Bond Fund currently holds a large percentage of its portfolio in mortgage-backed securities. During periods of falling interest rates, mortgage-backed securities may prepay the principal due, which may lower the Fund’s return by causing it to reinvest at lower interest rates. Some of the Domini Impact Bond Fund's community development investments may be unrated and carry greater credit risks than its other investments.

Investor Shares Overview
Socially and environmentally concerned investors have social, as well as financial, objectives. The Domini Impact Equity Fund seeks to meet these objectives by offering a diversified stock portfolio for long-term capital appreciation that is consistent with social and environmental priorities. 
Investment Objective
The Fund seeks to provide its shareholders with long-term total return.
Investment Strategy
The Fund invests primarily in stocks of U.S. companies that meet Domini Impact Investments’ social and environmental standards.
Subject to these standards, Wellington Management Company, LLP, the Fund’s subadvisor, seeks to add value using a diversified quantitative stock selection approach, while managing risk through portfolio construction.
Shareholder Activism
The Fund also advances its social and environmental objectives through proxy voting, dialogue with corporations, and the filing of shareholder resolutions
Social and Environmental Standards
Domini evaluates the Fund’s current and potential investments against its social and environmental standards based on the businesses in which they engage, as well as on the quality of their relations with key stakeholders, including communities, customers, ecosystems, employees, investors, and suppliers.
Domini may determine that a security is eligible for investment even if a corporation’s profile reflects a mixture of positive and negative social and environmental characteristics.
Investor Profile
Who Should Invest:
Investors seeking long-term growth of capital.
Investors committed to the Fund's socially responsible investment standards.
Who Should Not Invest:
Investors unwilling or unable to accept moderate to significant fluctuations in share price.



1. Until 11/30/17, Domini Impact Investments LLC has contractually agreed to waive certain fees and/or reimburse certain expenses, including management fees, so that the Fund's expenses will not exceed, on a per annum basis, 1.25% of the daily net assets representing Investor shares, absent an earlier modification by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.
All data as of 6/30/17 unless otherwise noted. 
Note: On 11/30/06, the Fund, formerly an index fund, transitioned to an active management strategy.
 
The Fund's returns, quoted above, represent past performance after all expenses, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return, principal value, and yield will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Each Fund charges a 2.00% redemption fee on sales or exchanges of shares made less than 30 days after the settlement of purchase or acquisition through exchange, with certain exceptions. See the applicable prospectus for further information. Select the Performance Tab for more complete performance information.
 
The performance quoted above does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares. Total return is based on the Fund’s net asset values and assumes all dividends and capital gains were reinvested. An investment in the Domini Impact Equity Fund is subject to market risks such as sector concentration and style risk. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured. You may lose money.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) is an unmanaged index of common stocks. Investors cannot invest directly in the S&P 500. 
Although the Fund's Investor shares are no-load, certain fees and expenses apply to a continued investment and are described in the prospectus. The composition of the Fund's portfolio is subject to change.
The Domini Funds maintain portfolio holdings disclosure policies that govern the timing and circumstances of disclosure to shareholders and third parties of information regarding the portfolio investments held by the Funds.

Definitions:
The Price/Earnings Ratio is a stock’s current price divided by the company’s trailing 12-month earnings per share. The Price/Book Ratio is used to compare a stock's market value to its book value. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share. The P/E and P/B ratio of a fund is the weighted average of the price/earnings and price/book ratios of the underlying stocks in a fund’s portfolio. 
R-squared measures how a fund’s performance correlates with a benchmark index’s performance and shows what portion of it can be explained by the performance of the overall market/index. R-squared ranges from  0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect correlation.
Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to its benchmark index. A beta greater (less) than 1 is more (less) volatile than the index.

Market Overview

U.S. equities continued to rally for the seventh straight quarter, with the S&P 500 returning 3.09%. Plunging oil prices and a more muddied political and economic outlook were not enough to derail market momentum, as the S&P hit a series of new record highs. In a well-telegraphed move, the Federal Reserve Bank hiked rates by another 25 basis points and laid out a plan for balance sheet normalization later this year, provided the economy improves as expected. The economic picture this quarter, though, was somewhat more mixed. The final estimate for first-quarter GDP growth was revised higher, driven by increased spending on health care, financial services and insurance, while the manufacturing index ticked up on new orders, and consumer confidence rose above expectations due to the solid job market and rising stock and home prices. Payroll and housing data reports, however, disappointed, and a tick-down in the unemployment rate was mostly due to a drop in the size of the labor force.
On the political front, controversy surrounding the White House and the ongoing Russia investigation continued to escalate, while Senate Republicans again delayed a vote on their controversial health care reform bill after failing to garner significant support. By the end of the quarter, volatility picked up in the U.S. equity market, as investors rotated out of growth and momentum stocks and back into cyclical and value plays.
 

Fund Performance
The Fund’s Investor shares returned 0.27% for the quarter, underperforming the S&P 500 Index return of 3.09%. Security selection was the largest driver of underperformance, particularly within the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors, as well as industrials and financials. This was slightly offset by a benefit from being underweight to energy, which was one of the worst performing sectors this quarter.

For both the Fund and the Index, Health Care was the best performing sector this quarter, lifted by positive trial data and increased merger and acquisition rumors, as well as speculation that an upcoming executive order on drug pricing could benefit pharmaceutical companies. The largest positive contributor to the Fund’s relative performance was diagnostic information services company Quest Diagnostics, which returned almost 14% for the quarter. Quest reported better-than-expected earnings for the twelfth straight quarter, with solid organic volume growth led by recovery in healthcare utilization. Quest's partnerships with hospitals are showing traction, boosting volumes to the highest level in two years. The company is well positioned to gain share from hospital-based labs in the long-term as it continues to sign new partnerships. Meanwhile, its retail business is also ramping up, with the company set to add more than a hundred new Safeway stores, which will eventually replace Quest’s existing patient service centers and should provide numerous cost-reduction opportunities. Medical equipment company Edwards Lifesciences was another top contributor from the Health Care sector, returning almost 26% for the quarter. Edwards rose to six-month highs after reporting better-than-expected results for the first quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales of transcatheter aortic heart valves, and lifting annual sales guidance.
Another top contributor to relative performance was truck engine manufacturer Cummins, which returned more than 8% for the quarter after reporting first-quarter earnings 26% higher than the first quarter last year, far surpassing expectations. Stronger industrial demand from construction and mining is offsetting weaker demand from truck production in North America, while international sales benefitted from growth in China and Europe. Cummins highlighted an initiative for automated transmissions that will be fully integrated into its engine production and is expected to deliver up to a 7% improvement in fuel economy.
Relative performance was also helped by the Fund not holding General Electric, which is not approved for investment by the Domini Funds due to its involvement with the weapons industry and nuclear power plants, and by having an underweight position in AT&T. Both companies declined more than 8% for the quarter. AT&T reported lower-than-expected first quarter results, driven by weaker consumer net additions for wireless services, but partially offset by stronger broadband results. The stock fell on news of AT&T’s planned acquisition with Time Warner, which would be its second large acquisition in three years. The acquisition would further increase net debt and weaken its credit metrics.
These positive contributions to the Fund’s relative performance were more than offset by a number of significant detractors. The two largest individual detractors this quarter were retailers Foot Locker and Ross Stores, which declined more than 33% and 12%, respectively. Shoe and apparel retailer Foot Locker, after having already lowered its previously issued guidance, reported first-quarter results that came in below diminished expectations. Despite the company’s long history of tight inventory control and spending discipline, it is facing a significant structural challenge due to having a large number of brick-and-mortar stores in a declining mall environment. Discount home and apparel retailer Ross Stores declined along with other retailers this quarter, despite bucking the retail trend by reporting stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter, driven by strong store traffic and average basket size.
The next largest detractors were in the Information Technology sector. Application services software company F5 Networks declined almost 11% for the quarter after reporting quarterly results that missed consensus estimates, driven by weakness in European sales and flat growth in services. F5 is facing short-term headwinds from delayed purchase decisions attributed to a transition from physical to virtual application-delivery controllers, customer hesitance in moving to the cloud, and political uncertainty in Europe. IBM also declined almost 11% after quarterly sales fell short of estimates. This marked its 20th consecutive quarter of revenue declines. IBM is similarly experiencing delays in service contracts and weakness in European markets, while its investments in high-growth areas have yet to generate sufficient sales to offset declines in legacy businesses.
Walgreens Boots Alliance, the holding company for Walgreens pharmacy, was another significant detractor, declining more than 5% for the quarter. Pharmacy stocks fell following a report that Amazon is considering entering the business of selling prescription drugs.

Making a Difference



Domini engages in direct dialogue with corporations in our portfolios and files shareholder proposals on a broad range of social, environmental, and corporate governance issues. Shareholder activism — the practice of active ownership — lies at the heart of what we believe responsible investing is all about. Here are a few ways your investment in the Domini Funds has made a difference. For more stories, click here.
 


A Season of Accountability
If you sit on the board of a publicly traded company, there is only one time of year when you must face your shareholders. For most companies, that time is at the spring annual meeting. Since the 1960’s, shareholders have raised key issues of concern at these meetings, from napalm production to racial discrimination to climate change. On behalf of our fund shareholders, we have submitted more than 250 shareholder proposals over the past 22 years, ensuring that your voice is heard.

Protecting Freedom of Expression and Privacy on the Internet
Internet and telecommunications companies receive thousands of requests per year from governments around the world to censor content or divulge information about their users. Many of these requests violate international human rights principles. For the past ten years, Domini has helped to build the Global Network Initiative (GNI), an organization focused on protecting freedom of expression and privacy from improper government intrusion.

Mandatory Sustainability Reporting
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a historic Concept Release, seeking comments on a wide range of rules that require publicly traded companies to disclose information to their investors. We were very pleased to see the inclusion of a series of questions about sustainability information among the Release’s more than 300 pages.

Positive Change at Four Companies
In addition to using social, environmental and governance standards to select our investments, each year the Domini Social Equity Fund submits shareholder proposals to corporations in its portfolio, addressing a broad range of social and environmental issues.  They send a strong message to corporate management, and can often encourage the company to speak to us about reaching an agreement.

Our Position on Fossil Fuel Owners and Producers
For many years, Domini has incorporated concerns about the environmental risks of companies owning and producing fossil fuels into our investment standards. Over time, we have gradually eliminated an increasing number of these firms from our holdings as our concerns about a variety of environmental and safety issues, including climate change, have increased.

The Starfish Story
Thousands of starfish washed ashore. A little girl began throwing them in the water so they wouldn't die. "Don't bother, dear," her mother said, "it won't make a difference."
The girl stopped for a moment and looked at the starfish in her hand.
        "It will make a difference to this one."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
