NEW YORK, Dec. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Provista Diagnostics, Inc. today announced that Ana Lourenco, M.D. of Rhode Island Medical Imaging, will present data from their second prospective clinical study at the 101st Scientific Assembly & Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago, IL.  Dr. Lourenco will be presenting "Proteomics at Work: Can a Protein-based Blood Assay Help Detect Breast Cancer in Women Aged 25-75 with BI-RADS® 3 or 4 Imaging Findings?" as part of the Breast Imaging (Practice Issues) Education Session. The presentation will take place on Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 3:20 PM in meeting room E451A at the McCormick Place Lakeside Center in Chicago, IL.

Provista's prospective, blinded, randomized, study enrolled over 500 patients from 10 breast cancer centers across the United States and included women ages 25-75 who had a BI-RADS 3 (probably benign) or BI-RADS 4 (suspicious) finding on imaging. The goal of this study was to develop a blood based diagnostic test, consisting of multiple serum protein biomarkers and tumor associated autoantibodies, to aid in the detection of breast cancer. Data from this study demonstrated the ability of Provista's biomarker assay to accurately detect the presence or absence of invasive breast cancer and/or DCIS with a high sensitivity, specificity, negative predicative value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV).  
"Provista's technology is not only groundbreaking as a complimentary diagnostic, but is also backed by strong, prospective clinical trial data," said Dr. Lourenco. "I chose to present their findings because I wanted to ensure my fellow radiologists learned of it."
With this data, Provista has developed Videssa® Breast, a protein-based blood test that can accurately detect the presence or absence of breast cancer. Videssa® Breast detects breast cancer, rather than assessing a patient's risk for developing cancer in the future by identifying early warning signals of breast cancer, called biomarkers. The combination of this proteomic approach with traditional imaging provides concrete biochemical evidence allowing for improved diagnostic accuracy and greater confidence in clinical decision-making. Provista's diagnostic test can help determine when further clinical evaluation is warranted, theoretically decreasing the rate of false positive and false negative results.
"Provista is honored to have Dr. Lourenco present our data at this year's RSNA meeting," said David Reese, Ph. D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Provista Diagnostics. "As a participant of our clinical trials and a well-respected radiologist, Dr. Lourenco provides valuable insight and validity to our data amongst a large group of peers." 
Videssa® Breast is a Laboratory Developed Test, currently approved for sale in 49 states with a projected commercial launch date in 2016.
About Provista Diagnostics, Inc.Provista Diagnostics is a privately held molecular diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing a new generation of proprietary blood-based diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tests designed to address the unmet needs in women's cancer, such as breast and gynecologic cancers. Provista Diagnostics' state-of-the-art, high complexity clinical laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to be compliant with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).

Addressing Diagnostic Dilemmas with Videssa Breast



























For patients with abnormal or difficult-to-interpret mammograms, breast imaging has known limitations. Benign breast disease can mimic the appearance of cancer, increasing false positives and breast density can obscure cancers increasing false negatives. This can lead to uncertainty about whether or not immediate follow-up is needed, patient anxiety and unnecessary downstream procedures contributing to increased healthcare costs.














eBook: Breast Cancer Detection: Not a “One-Size-Fits-All” Approach
There is a critical need for an alternative approach to complement breast imaging when clinical assessment is challenging, particularly in women with abnormal or difficult-to-interpret imaging findings.

 




























The Videssa Breast Solution















In patients with abnormal or difficult-to-interpret mammograms, confidently choosing a “watch and wait” approach versus immediate follow-up can be challenging. With a simple blood draw, Videssa Breast can inform whether further diagnostic procedures may be warranted or provide assurance that a patient likely does not have breast cancer. When combined with imaging, Videssa Breast improves diagnostic accuracy and provides greater confidence and clarity when assessment is challenging.

eBook: Breakthrough Clinical Results:How Videssa Breast is Changing Breast Cancer Detection
Download our free eBook which reveals additional insights into the clinical performance of Videssa Breast and rigorous scientific discovery behind the test.




























Is Videssa Breast Right for Your Patients?
Videssa Breast is recommended for use in women between the ages of 25 and 75 with abnormal or difficult-to-interpret mammographic findings. When considering biopsy or advanced imaging, Videssa Breast can help identify which patients who may or may not warrant immediate follow-up.

Overview









Introduction
Videssa Breast is the first protein-based blood test of its kind to provide early and accurate detection of breast cancer. Videssa Breast may provide clarity for women who receive abnormal mammogram results and/or have dense breasts. With a simple blood draw, Videssa Breast helps determine whether you have breast cancer now, not your future risk of developing the disease. Results are not impacted by breast density, which allows for earlier and more accurate detection and provides you and your healthcare provider more information and clarity with your mammogram results.











Julie’s Journey with Dense Breasts
For women with dense breasts and abnormal mammograms, annual breast cancer imaging can cause stress and anxiety. This stress, worry and anxiety of uncertainty can interfere with every aspect of a woman’s life. Find out how Videssa Breast helps alleviate anxiety for Julie in her video.

Frequently Asked Questions










Does this test replace my regular mammography screening? 

No, you should maintain your regular breast cancer screening as recommended by your healthcare provider. Videssa Breast is recommended for patients with abnormal or unclear mammogram results and/or with dense breasts. 














How can Videssa Breast help my healthcare provider to make decisions about my care? 

Videssa Breast provides information that when combined with imaging results, allow your healthcare provider to make informed decisions on your treatment options. Mammogram results provide a visual interpretation of your breasts while Videssa provides biological evidence of the presence or absence of cancer. By combining imaging with Videssa Breast, your healthcare provider can have a more complete assessment of your breasts thus, improving early and accurate breast cancer detection.

Low Protein Signature (No): likely indicates the absence of breast cancer. Your healthcare provider may use these results along with other available clinical data to determine with confidence if follow-up (additional imaging and/or biopsy) is needed.
High Protein Signature (Yes): may potentially indicate the presence of breast cancer. Your healthcare provider may use these results along with other available clinical data to determine with confidence if immediate follow-up (additional imaging and/or biopsy) is needed.















What can the test tell me? 

Videssa Breast helps determine whether you have breast cancer right now. This test is not like genetic tests, which are designed to determine your future risk of developing the disease. Results are not impacted by breast density, allowing for earlier and more accurate detection of breast cancer.

CLINICIAN'S INSIGHTS: On the SIGNIFICANCE OF VIDESSA BREAST

































Healthcare Providers
Clinical Insights












Clinical Insights
The more you know about an abnormal or difficult-to-interpret imaging finding, the better you can manage it. Videssa Breast evaluates breast abnormalities at a biochemical level thus, serving as an ideal diagnostic complement to imaging, which evaluates anatomical features.  When considering additional imaging and/or biopsy, Videssa Breast can help answer challenging clinical questions and identify patients who may or may not need immediate follow-up.




































 











To Biopsy or Not to Biopsy?

With an NPV greater than 98 percent, a low protein signature test result on Videssa Breast indicates that there is less than two percent probability of breast cancer, independent of imaging, which can help reduce the number of biopsies performed among:

BI-RADS 3 patients insisting on biopsy, Videssa can help guide a patient to forego biopsy and reduce the anxiety of “watchful waiting”
Women assessed in the BI-RADS 3/BI-RADS 4A “gray zone,” where next steps may be unclear, Videssa increases confidence in negative results to identify patients who may not warrant immediate follow-up
Women with abnormal mammograms who are at an elevated risk, Videssa can provide increased confidence in “watchful waiting”

















Is Advanced Imaging Needed?

The Videssa Breast test result can help determine the need for additional imaging among:

Women with dense breasts, where imaging may be difficult to interpret or make a cancer easy to miss/overlook – a high protein signature test result can help identify patients who warrant additional imaging and/or more frequent follow-up
BI-RADS 3 patients considering additional imaging, Videssa Breast helps determine the timing of imaging—immediate versus six-months

Introduction












Introduction
Provista Diagnostics is a privately held molecular diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing a new generation of proprietary blood-based diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tests designed to address the unmet needs in women’s cancers. Our first commercial product, Videssa® Breast, is focused on early breast cancer detection, while additional products in development will focus on gynecologic cancers such as ovarian, endometrial and HPV-associated.  Provista’s state-of-the-art, high-complexity clinical laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).














Opportunity
In the US market, approximately 50 percent of women (15.5 million) undergoing mammography have a dense breast classification. Breast density impacts a physician's ability to identify cancers at an early stage. Over half of the country has enacted legislation requiring healthcare providers to inform patients of breast density at the time of screening.  In addition, 5.2 million women annually have breast imaging results where the presence of malignancy is difficult to determine. In these situations additional imaging and biopsies are typically required. Of the 1.7 million biopsies performed annually, 70 to 90 percent result in a benign diagnosis. For these healthcare providers, an additional diagnostic test, such as Videssa® Breast can provide clarity.  Provista's clinical trials observed that 98 to 99 percent of women with a negative Videssa Breast test result will not have cancer and therefore can forego additional imaging and biopsies. By providing additional information, Videssa Breast can help minimize patient anxiety and reduce overall health costs.


















eBook: Breast Cancer Detection: Not A “One-Size-Fits-All” Approach
There is a critical need for an alternative approach to complement breast imaging technologies when a clinical assessment is challenging, particularly in women with abnormal imaging results and/or dense breasts.








 




























Technology
Provista's proprietary ProteoMark® Technology detects and analyzes multiple tumor protein biomarkers for improved cancer detection. Unlike other blood-based technologies (such as circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA), breast cancer tumor proteins are well understood in the scientific literature and easily identified in blood, which offers a more effective approach for cancer detection.

What is Videssa Breast?
Videssa Breast is the first protein-based blood test of its kind to provide early and accurate detection of breast cancer. Videssa Breast may provide clarity to women who receive ambiguous mammography results and/or have dense breasts. With a simple blood draw, Videssa Breast can help healthcare providers determine with greater confidence, whether further diagnostic procedures are warranted or provide assurance that a patient likely does not have breast cancer.

Videssa Breast Introduction
Videssa Breast is the first protein-based blood test of its kind to provide early and accurate detection of breast cancer. Videssa Breast may provide clarity for women who receive abnormal mammogram results and/or have dense breasts. Videssa detects breast cancer in real-time, not the future risk of developing the disease. Videssa Breast delivers a more accurate "yes," reducing the risk of a missed or delayed cancer diagnosis, or delivers a high-confidence and accurate "no," reducing your chances of having a biopsy or additional imaging that could be avoided if you do not have cancer. For patients, the accuracy and reliability of Videssa Breast provides the comfort that comes with clear, reliable results and reduces the stress and burden that comes with additional testing and frequent follow-up.

Provista Diagnostics Expands Exclusive License Agreement for Biodesign Biomarker Technologies
May 28, 2014









Download Photo




May 28, 2014
 

Provista Diagnostics, Inc., a molecular diagnostics company developing and commercializing proteomic-based diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tests for cancers affecting women, today announced it has expanded its exclusive license agreement for certain biomarker and autoantibody technologies identified by researchers Joshua LaBaer, M.D., Ph.D. and Karen Anderson, M.D., Ph.D. of the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University.  The license provides Provista with access to patents, proprietary technology, materials, processing techniques and protocols necessary for detection of certain autoantibodies and use of certain biomarkers. 
This agreement expands Provista's evaluation license, allowing full use of these technologies for further research and development of diagnostics products for early detection of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and human papillomavirus.  The first agreement, signed in October of 2013, allowed for the initial evaluation of applicability for this purpose. 
"This is an important next step in signifying the potential clinical and market viability of our research and development focus," said Dr. David E. Reese, President and Chief Executive Officer of Provista.  "The technologies were discovered at Harvard University Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and completed at ASU Biodesign Institute in the laboratories of Joshua LaBaer, M.D., Ph.D. and Karen Anderson M.D., Ph.D. These advances are important to Provista's diagnostics strategy. The combination of these biomarkers with our proprietary assays is important in the development of proteomic tests for early cancer detection."
Biomarkers are substances within the body that can indicate the presence of a disease prior to the clinical manifestation of symptoms. They can help detect cancer at an early stage, which has been shown to significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival.  For example, according to the American Cancer Society, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the five-year survival rate is greater than 90 percent.  However, fewer than one in five cases are detected at an early stage, because symptoms are typically minimal and invasive surgery is required for diagnosis.  To date, no screening biomarkers are recommended for the general population in detecting ovarian cancer.
In the case of breast cancer, while there have been advances in detection and treatment, the disease remains a common and devastating health problem that can be difficult to diagnose. According to the American Cancer Society almost one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer, and these are frequently not diagnosed until a late stage.
"The prospect for diagnostic tools to pinpoint biomarkers indicating the presence of cancers that have otherwise been undetectable presents a major opportunity for improved clinical care," said Dr. Joshua LaBaer, director of the Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics at the Biodesign Institute at ASU. "We are pleased Provista sees the value of our research, as we strongly believe that earlier disease detection offers the potential to not only save more patient lives, but to greatly reduce treatment burdens and health system costs."
The licensing agreement was brokered by Arizona Technology Enterprises (AzTE), ASU's technology transfer organization.  ASU, through the activities of AzTE, is annually one of the top-performing U.S. universities in terms of intellectual property inputs (inventions disclosed by ASU researchers) and outputs (licensing deals and start-ups) relative to the size of the university's research enterprise.
About Arizona Technology Enterprises
Established in 2003, Arizona Technology Enterprises (AzTE) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Arizona State University Foundation for A New American University. Over the last ten years Arizona Technology Enterprises has supported the development of more than 70 ASU spinout companies. Comprising industry and university veterans, AzTE brings together ASU's researchers and industry partners to transform discoveries into marketable products and services, taking innovation out of the lab and into the commercial marketplace.

Challenges of Detection
Breast Cancer Detection Dilemmas
Current methods of breast cancer detection do not meet the needs of all patients, particularly in women with abnormal or difficult-to-interpret imaging findings. Clinical examination and imaging technologies are critical elements for detecting and diagnosing breast cancer, yet the high rate of false positives and false negatives resulting from these approaches can significantly impact patient care. There is a clear need for an alternative approach to improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection when clinical assessment is challenging.
