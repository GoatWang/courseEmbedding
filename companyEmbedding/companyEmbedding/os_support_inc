Three tiers of support for Apple OS integration, migration, and advanced server operation.



AppleCare OS Support

Get the IT department-level support you need when deploying macOS, macOS Server, or iOS in your organization. AppleCare OS Support delivers phone and email support for integration, migration, and advanced server operation issues. Whether you have occasional questions or you need assistance on a regular basis, Apple has a plan to fit your requirements. Each plan provides one year of coverage.
What’s covered.
AppleCare OS Support plans provide enterprise-level incident support — defined as support for integration into heterogeneous environments; system components; network configuration and administration; professional software applications; web applications and services; and technical issues requiring the use of the command-line tools for resolution.1
Every AppleCare OS Support plan includes AppleCare Help Desk Support, an annual technical support plan that covers an unlimited number of support incidents for software installation, launch, and use; hardware and software diagnosis and troubleshooting; and issue isolation for Apple-based solutions.
Products covered under AppleCare Help Desk Support include:
