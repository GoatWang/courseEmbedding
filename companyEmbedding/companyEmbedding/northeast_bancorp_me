In addition, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had declared the regular quarterly dividend, which was increased during the past year, at $0.08 per share, payable on February 21, 2003 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2003.




	The Company also announced that earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2002, were $1,818,921 or $0.68 per diluted share compared to $1,960,724 or $0.75 for the same period last year. These results were in line with management's expectations, as the Company recently increased overhead via the opening of a Commercial Banking center in Portland. Yields on earning assets and cost of funds have followed the general decline in interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve cutting short-term interest rates during the past year. The pace of reducing the cost of funds has exceeded the decline in yields improving net interest income and net interest margin. Non-interest income increased from higher gains on the sales of residential real estate loans, investment and insurance commissions, cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance, and gains on the sale of investment securities. Non-interest expense also increased due to additional staff to support higher loan volume and new business initiatives in insurance and commercial loan brokerage; new leased commercial business branch in Portland and the relocation of Northeast Financial Services investment division to new leased office in Falmouth; amortization of intangibles recognized in the acquisition of Kendall Insurance (the Northeast Financial Services insurance division); and increased expenses accrued for the liquidation of acquired assets, and volume related outsourced transaction costs.




	Based upon the continued growth and development of the investment division, the Company has expanded its available space in Falmouth, Maine and added additional staff. The Company indicated that it fully expects that this investment in overhead will result in long term increased revenue, as the Company expands its ability to serve more customers in the development and management of their personal financial plans.




	Last quarter, the Company announced the opening of a Commercial Banking Center in Portland, Maine, the state's largest city. In addition, as part of the expansion into the Portland market, Northeast announced the creation of a new Commercial Mortgage Brokerage Division that will work with the Commercial Loan Division. The brokerage division will allow the Company to access a wide range of national and local lenders, thereby enhancing the Company's ability to successfully secure financing for each commercial relationship.




	The results for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 reflect increased expenses incurred in connection with these efforts, including an increase in net occupancy expenses associated with the development of new offices, additional compensation and benefit expenses for the Commercial Mortgage Brokerage Division staff, and the costs associated with supporting higher commercial and mortgage loan production. The Company continues to maintain an asset sensitive interest rate risk position, which is designed to protect the institution against a rising rate environment. Management is committed to manage interest rate risk and credit quality to ensure long-term stability and maintenance of a high level of balance sheet integrity.




	Jim Delamater, President & CEO commented, "We continue to be pleased with the overall growth and development of our organization and view the recently announced decision to expand within the Greater Portland market area as an important step towards the development of future income and the overall value of our franchise. While this effort has, and we believe will continue to impact our short-term earnings results, we fully expect that our growth plan will add to our overall capacity to increase earnings, particularly through the ability to deliver multiple financial products and services to each and every customer. We are excited about our expansion into the Greater Portland market area because we believe that this expansion will allow us to better serve existing clients within this region and assist us in attracting new business as a result of our high level of product and service diversity. We have opened offices at 77 Middle Street, a prime location in downtown Portland, which has with drive-up facility and easy access. We are optimistic that this investment in the Portland market will be offset by growth in revenue over the long term. We don't expect to see any meaningful impact on earnings until the 4

	th

	quarter since it, typically, takes some lead time to close new loans and to transfer accounts. To date, since the November opening, we are very pleased with the market's response to this new and exciting location and the level of publicity the expansion has brought us. This in turn has increased the visibility of our entire Company."

Item 4.



Description
of Securities.




 Description
of Non-Voting Common Stock

General

Holders of
the Non-Voting Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends if,
as and when declared by the Company’s board of directors out
of any funds legally available for dividends. Holders of the
Non-Voting Common Stock are also entitled, upon the Company’s
liquidation, and after claims of creditors and the preferences of
Series A preferred stock, and any other class or series of
preferred stock outstanding at the time of liquidation, to receive
pro rata the Company’s net assets. The Company pays dividends
on the Non-Voting Common Stock only if it has paid or provided for
all dividends on the outstanding series of preferred stock for the
then current period and, in the case of any cumulative preferred
stock, all prior periods. The Company’s board of directors is
classified, with respect to the term for which they severally hold
office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as reasonably
possible. At each annual meeting of shareholders, directors elected
to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for
a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting
of shareholders after their election.

The
Company’s Series A preferred stock has preference over the
Non-Voting Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends
and the distribution of assets in the event of the Company’s
liquidation or dissolution. The Company’s preferred stock
also has such other preferences as currently, or as may be, fixed
by the Company’s board of directors.

Shares of
the Non-Voting Common Stock have no voting power and are not
entitled to vote on any matter, provided that shares of the
Non-Voting Common Stock are entitled to vote with respect to
matters as to which shares of the Non-Voting Common Stock are
otherwise permitted to vote pursuant to 12 C.F.R. §
225.2(q)(2) and section 1004(1) of the Maine Business Corporation
Act, as in effect from time to time, or any successor provisions
thereto.

Shares of
the Non-Voting Common Stock will remain the Non-Voting Common Stock
in the hands of the holder thereof and shall automatically convert
into shares of the Voting Common Stock solely (i) upon a
transfer of such shares of the Non-Voting Common Stock to a
transferee that is not an affiliate of the transferor for purposes
of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act
or (ii) to the extent necessary to maintain the percentage of
the outstanding Voting Common Stock held by such holder of the
Non-Voting Common Stock as of immediately prior to any transaction,
the effect of which transaction would be to otherwise decrease such
percentage of the Voting Common Stock held by such holder of the
Non-Voting Common Stock by increasing the number of shares of the
Voting Common Stock outstanding.

Shares of
the Non-Voting Common Stock may be transferred solely where such
transfer is made (i) to an affiliate of such transferor of the
Non-Voting Common Stock for purposes of the Bank Holding Company
Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, (ii) in a widespread
public distribution (iii) to a transferee that holds or
controls more than 50% of any class of the Company’s voting
securities, (iv) in one or more transactions in which no
transferee (or group of transferees whose ownership of the
Company’s securities must 

 


 


be
aggregated for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act and the
Change in Bank Control Act) receives ownership or control of such
securities for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act and the
Change in Bank Control Act representing 2% or more of any class of
the Company’s voting securities, (v) in one or more open
market transactions effected on a stock exchange, electronic
communications network, or similar execution system or in the
over-the-counter market where the transferring holder has no prior
knowledge of or control or influence over the identity of the
ultimate transferees, (vi) to the Company with its approval in
its sole discretion, or (vii) as part of a transaction
approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Shares of
the Non-Voting Common Stock are not redeemable, and have no
subscription rights, preemptive rights or sinking fund provisions.
Outstanding shares of the Non-Voting Common Stock are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Except with respect to the
power to vote, shares of the Non-Voting Common Stock have the same
rights, preferences and limitations as shares of the Voting Common
Stock.

Anti-Takeover
Provisions

The
Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws include
certain provisions which may be considered to be
“anti-takeover” in nature because they may have the
effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of
control over the Company by means of a hostile tender offer,
exchange offer, proxy contest or similar transaction. These
provisions are intended to protect the shareholders of the Company
by providing a measure of assurance that the Company’s
shareholders will be treated fairly in the event of an unsolicited
takeover bid and by preventing a successful takeover bidder from
exercising its voting control to the detriment of the other
shareholders. However, the anti-takeover provisions set forth in
the Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, taken as
a whole, may discourage a hostile tender offer, exchange offer,
proxy solicitation or similar transaction relating to the
Non-Voting Common Stock. To the extent that these provisions
actually discourage such a transaction, holders of the Non-Voting
Common Stock may not have an opportunity to dispose of part or all
of their stock at a higher price than that prevailing in the
market. In addition, these provisions make it more difficult to
remove, and thereby may serve to entrench, incumbent directors and
officers of the Company, even if their removal would be regarded by
some shareholders as desirable.

The
provisions in the Company’s articles of incorporation that
may be considered to be “anti-takeover” in nature
include the following:

 




 



•



 



a
provision that does not permit shareholders to cumulate their votes
for the election of directors;




 




 



•



 



a
provision that requires a greater than majority shareholder vote in
order to approve certain business combinations and other
extraordinary corporate transactions;




 




 



•



 



a
provision that establishes criteria to be applied by the board of
directors in evaluating an acquisition proposal;




 




 



•



 



a
provision that requires a greater than majority shareholder vote in
order for the shareholders to remove a director from office without
cause;




 




 



•



 



a
provision that limits the right of the shareholders to amend the
bylaws; and




 




 



•



 



a
provision that requires, under certain circumstances, a greater
than majority shareholder vote in order to amend the articles of
incorporation.




In
addition, a provision in the bylaws that limits the permissible
number of directors may be considered to be anti-takeover in
nature.

Section 1109
of the Maine Business Corporation Act also may have some
anti-takeover effect. Section 1109 of the Maine Business
Corporation Act generally provides that a Maine corporation which
has a class of voting stock registered or traded on a national
securities exchange or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
such as the Company, may not engage in any business combination for
five years following an interested shareholder’s stock
acquisition date unless the business combination is
(1) approved by the corporation’s board of directors
prior to that interested shareholder’s stock acquisition date
or (2) approved, subsequent to that interested
shareholder’s stock acquisition date, by the board of
directors of the Maine corporation and authorized by the holders of
a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation not
beneficially owned by that interested shareholder or any affiliate
or associate thereof or by 

 


 


persons
who are either directors or officers and also employees of the
corporation. An interested shareholder is defined to include any
person, firm or entity that is directly or indirectly the
beneficial owner of 25% or more of the outstanding voting stock of
the corporation, other than by reason of a revocable proxy given in
response to a proxy solicitation conducted in accordance with the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is not then reportable on a
Schedule 13D under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and stock
acquisition date is defined to mean the date that any person, firm
or entity first becomes an interested shareholder of that
corporation.

The
foregoing description of the Non-Voting Common Stock is intended to
be a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the full text
of the Company’s articles of incorporation, incorporated
herein by reference to Annex D of the Company’s Registration
Statement on Form S-4, as amended (File
No. 333-167295).

 





Item 6.



Indemnification
of Directors and Officers.




The Maine
Business Corporate Act provides that a corporation may indemnify a
director or officer who is a party to a proceeding because that
individual is a director or officer of the corporation against
liability incurred in the proceeding, if (i) the
individual’s conduct was in good faith; (ii) the
individual reasonably believed, in the case of conduct in the
individual’s official capacity, that the individual’s
conduct was in the best interests of the corporation; and in all
other cases, that the individual’s conduct was at least not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and (iii) in
the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no
reasonable cause to believe the individual’s conduct was
unlawful.

The
Company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that
each director and officer shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Company as referenced above. Advances against expenses may be
made under the bylaws and any other indemnification agreement that
may be entered into by the Company and the indemnity coverage
provided thereunder may include liabilities under the federal
securities laws as well as in other contexts.

The
Company has purchased and maintains insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director or officer against any loss arising
from any claim asserted against any such person and incurred by
such person in any such capacity, subject to certain
exclusions.

any material information with respect to the plan of distribution
not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any
material change to such information in the registration
statement;




provided
,
however , that paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) do not
apply if the information required to be included in a
post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in
reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant
pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
Act that are incorporated by reference in the registration
statement.

 




 



(2)



That, for
the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act,
each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,
and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to
be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




 




 



(3)



To remove
from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the
securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination
of the offering.




 




(b)



The
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each
filing of the Company’s annual report pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where
applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual
report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is
incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at
that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof.




 




(c)



Insofar as
indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other
than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with
the securities being registered, the Company will, unless in the
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

Re:



Securities
Being Registered under Registration Statement on Form
S-8




Ladies and
Gentlemen:

We have
acted as counsel to you in connection with your filing of a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 (the “ Registration
Statement ”) pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “ Securities Act ”), on or about
the date hereof relating to an aggregate of 810,054 shares of
voting common stock, $1.00 par value per share (the “Voting
Shares”), and 810,054 shares of non-voting common stock,
$1.00 par value per share (together with the Voting Shares, the
“Shares”), of Northeast Bancorp, a Maine corporation
(the “ Company ”), that may be issued pursuant
to the Northeast Bancorp 2010 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
“ Plan ”).

We have
reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have
deemed appropriate to give the opinions expressed below. We have
relied, without independent verification, on certificates of public
officials and, as to matters of fact material to the opinion set
forth below, on certificates of officers of the Company.

In our
examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents
of all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic or other
copies, the authenticity of the originals of any such documents and
the legal competence of all signatories to such
documents.

The
opinion expressed below is limited to the Maine Business
Corporation Act (which includes applicable provisions of the Maine
Constitutions and reported judicial decisions interpreting the
Maine Business Corporation Act and the Maine
Constitution).

For
purposes of the opinion expressed below, we have assumed that a
sufficient number of authorized but unissued shares of the
Company’s Common Stock will be available for issuance when
the Shares are issued. We have also assumed that the appropriate
action has been taken to register and qualify the Shares for sale
under all applicable state securities or “blue sky”
laws to the extent required.

Based on
the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares have been duly
authorized and, upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor
in accordance with the terms of the Plan, will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable.

 

 


 

 


 





It is
understood that this opinion is to be used only in connection with
the offer and sale of the Shares while the Registration Statement
is in effect.

Please
note that we are opining only as to the matters expressly set forth
herein, and no opinion should be inferred as to any other
matters.

We hereby
consent to the inclusion of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the
Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements of
Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. In
giving our consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of
persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the
Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.

 




 





Very truly
yours,





 





/s/ Pierce
Atwood LLP
