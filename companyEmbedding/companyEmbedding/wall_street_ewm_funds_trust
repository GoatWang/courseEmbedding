Interesting EWM Put Options For January 2018






DividendChannel.com




May 22, 2017 11:42 AM EDT













 


















































 Investors in iShares MSCI Malaysia Index Fund ( EWM) saw new options become available today, for the January 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 242 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EWM options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.  The put contract at the $32.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $32.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $30.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EWM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $32.29/share today. Because the $32.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.31% return on the cash commitment, or 8.01% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

EWM: ETF Outflow Alert






ETFChannel.com




Aug 20, 2015 11:10 AM EDT













 


























































 Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF ( EWM) where we have detected an approximate $26.9 million dollar outflow -- that's a 8.0% decrease week over week (from 32,700,000 to 30,075,000).   START SLIDESHOW:Click here to find out which 9 other ETFs experienced notable outflows »   The chart below shows the one year price performance of EWM, versus its 200 day moving average:    Looking at the chart above, EWM's low point in its 52 week range is $10.03 per share, with $16.32 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $10.06. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique -- learn more about the 200 day moving average ».  Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

What Makes Us Exceptional— And Sets Us Apart 

Masters of One. Most financial professionals are “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” The DRL Group has taken a different approach to financial services. “We are Masters of One”, having spent decades doing one thing well: fixed-income investing. We specialize in the bond market, helping provide fixed-income solutions for our clients. You can expect this singular focus from the DRL Group.
Price-Efficient Trade Execution: Thanks to our state-of-the-art technology, DRL Group clients have access to both the primary and secondary bond markets. This provides you with efficient pricing because we can execute trades on both the buy and sell side of the transaction, which in most cases, could result in higher returns.
Municipal and Corporate Bond Specialists. Our team of professionals is focused on providing fixed-income solutions to produce a stable income stream—and help protect principal value. We create customized bond portfolios to preserve capital and minimize risk, while maximizing client returns in unpredictable market environments.
Tax Free Investment Solutions. Our clients are interested in shielding their investment income from taxes. For investors who want tax-exempt investment solutions, we can purchase at dealer level pricing, with a nominal mark up on attractive tax-free bonds. This results in higher yields for our clientele.
Well Versed with Major Market Fluctuations. With over 35 years of collective industry expertise, we have been through significant ups and downs of the economy and the market. We have extensive experience adapting our clients’ portfolios to ever-changing market conditions. We will do the same for you.
Personalized Process. All clients receive the personal attention they deserve. We take the time to understand each client’s needs based on their tax bracket, age, goals, and financial situation. We continuously analyze and update strategies to meet our clients’ evolving individual objectives for income, growth, and asset protection. And, our clients deal directly with the owners of the firm—not junior advisors or a call center. We know our clients’ time is extremely valuable, so when a client calls, we pick up the phone. You can always expect good, old-fashioned service.
Award Recognition. The DRL Group has been consistently recognized as one of Houston’s Top Wealth Managers. The National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices (NABCAP) named us among the Top Wealth Managers two years running, and the Houston Business Journal featured us in both 2012 and 2013. We have also been showcased as one of the Best Businesses of Katy, TX, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. You’ll be taken care of by an award-winning team.
Independent. Since we are not owned by a bank or an insurance company, we sell no proprietary, high commission products. Instead, the financial products we do offer are dependent on what’s in the best interest of our clients. All of our operations are highly regulated. Your investment funds are held at our custodian, National Financial Services, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.

Competitors

Sorry, no analysis for iShares, Inc. - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF's competitors could be found in our database.

















Value
 Is iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 


Here we compare the current
share price of iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF to its discounted cash flow value.
The discounted cash flow value is simply looking at what the company is worth today, based on estimates of how much money it is expected to make in the future.



 Dividends have been used for this discounted cash flow calculation, why is this?
 The current share price of iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF is above its future cash flow value. 
Often investors are willing to pay a premium for a company that has a high dividend or the potential for future growth.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.




Price based on past earnings

Are iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF's earnings available for a low price, and how does this compare to other companies in the same industry?


No earnings or negative earnings.

No earnings or negative earnings.

No earnings or negative earnings.




Price based on value of assets
What value do investors place on iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF's assets?

X
Value checks
We assess iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF's value by looking at:

Is the discounted cash flow value less than 20%, or 40% of the share price? (2 checks) (Click here or on bar chart for details of DCF calculation.)
Is the PE ratio less than the market average, and/ or less than the Financial Institutions industry average (and greater than 0)? (2 checks)
Is the PEG ratio within a reasonable range (0 to 1)? (1 check)
Is the PB ratio less than the Financial Institutions industry average (and greater than 0)? (1 check)
iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF has a total score of 1/6, see the detailed checks below.
Note: We use GAAP Earnings per Share in all our calculations including PE and PEG Ratio.
Note 2: PEG ratio is based on analysts EPS growth expectations in 1 year (0%).
Full details on the Value part of the Simply Wall St company analysis model.

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$20.4 = ($1.68 / (10.55% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $20.4
Current discount (share price of $31.8): -56%

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 10.55% = 2.33% + (1.072 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 1.072
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.072

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is iShares - iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 0 analysts?

Historical Debt 

Nearly all companies have debt. Debt in itself isn’t bad, however if the debt is too high, or the company can’t afford to pay the interest on its debts this may have impacts in the future.

Evercore Equity Fund




Objective: Growth of Capital
 
Strategy: The fund invests in companies that we believe are experiencing positive and sustainable fundamental changes, based on the analysis of each company’s prospects, returns, past and expected future performance, and the quality of its corporate management and capital allocation. The portfolio typically has between 30-50 holdings and includes large, medium, and small capitalization stocks that are diversified by company size, economic sector, business geography, valuation, and financial strength.
 
Risks: Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Evercore Equity Fund may invest in smaller companies, which involves additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than large capitalization companies. The Evercore Equity Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve political, economic and currency risks, greater volatility and differences in accounting methods. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Earnings growth is not representative of the Evercore Equity Fund’s future performance. These and other risks associated with investing in the Evercore Equity Fund can be found in the prospectus and the SAI.
