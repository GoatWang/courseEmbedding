Economic Manuscripts: Capital: Volume Two



Capital Volume II
Part I: The Metamorphoses of Capital and their Circuits
Chapter 1: The Circuit of Money Capital

The circular movement [1] of capital takes place in three
stages, which, according to the presentation in Volume I, form the following
series:
First stage: The capitalist appears as a buyer on the commodity- and the labour-market; his money is transformed into commodities, or
it goes through the circulation act M — C.
Second Stage: Productive consumption of the purchased commodities by the capitalist. He acts as a capitalist producer of commodities; his
capital passes through the process of production. The result is a commodity
of more value than that of the elements entering into its production.
Third Stage: The capitalist returns to the market as a
seller; his commodities are turned into money; or they pass through the
circulation act C — M.
Hence the formula for the circuit of money-capital is: M — C ...
P ... C' — M', the dots indicating that the process of circulation is interrupted,
and C' and M' designating C and M increased by surplus-value.
The first and third stages were discussed in Book I only in so
far as this was necessary for the understanding of the second stage, the
process of production of capital. For this reason, the various forms which
capital takes on in its different stages, and which now assumes and now
strips off in the repetition of its circuit, were not considered. These
forms are now the direct object of our study.
In order to conceive these forms in their pure state, one must
first of all discard all factors which have nothing to do with the changing
or building of forms as such. It is therefore taken for granted here not
only that the commodities are sold at their values but also that this takes
place under the same conditions throughout. Likewise disregarded therefore
are any changes of value which might occur during the movement in circuits.

I. First Stage. M — C [2]

M — C represents the conversion of a sum of money into a sum of commodities;
the purchaser transforms his money into commodities, the sellers transform
their commodities into money. What renders this act of the general circulation
of commodities simultaneously a functionally definite section in independent
circuit of some individual capital is primarily not the form of the act
but its material content, the specific use-character of the commodities
which change places with the money. These commodities are on the one hand
means of production, on the other labour-power, material and personal factors
in the production of commodities whose specific nature must of course correspond
to the special kind of articles to be manufactured. If we call labour-power
L, and the means of production MP, then the sum of commodities to be bought,
C, is equal to L + MP, or more briefly C<LMP.
 M — C, considered as to its substance is therefore represented by M — C<LMP, that is to say M — C is composed of M — L and M — MP. The sum of money M is separated into two parts, one of which buys labour-power, the other means of production. These two series of purchases belong to entirely different markets, the one to the commodity-market proper, the other to the labour-market.
Aside from this qualitative division of the sum of commodities into which M is transformed, the formula M — C<LMP also represents a most characteristic quantitative relation.
We know that the value, or price, of labour-power is paid to its
owner, who offers it for sale as a commodity, in the form of wages, that
is to say as the price of a sum of labour containing surplus-labour. For
instance if the daily value of labour-power is equal to the product of
five hours labour valued at three shillings, this sum figures in the contract
between the buyer and seller as the price, or wages, for, say, ten hours
of labour. If such a contract is made for instance with 50 labourers, they
are supposed to work altogether 500 hours per day for the purchaser, and
one half of this time, or 250 hours equal to 25 days of labour of 10 hours
each, represents nothing but surplus labour. The quantity and the volume
of the means of production to be purchased must be sufficient for the utilisation
of this mass of labour.
M — C<LMP,
then, does not merely express the qualitative relation indicating that a certain sum of money, say £422, is exchanged for a corresponding sum of means of production and labour-power, but also a quantitative relation between L, the part of the money spent
for labour-power, and MP, the part spent for means of production. This
relation is determined at the outset by the quantity of excess labour,
of surplus-labour to be expended by a certain number of labourers.
If for instance in a spinning-mill the weekly wage of its 50 labourers
amounts to £50, £372 must be spent for means of production,
if this is the value of the means of production which a weekly labour of
3,000 hours, 1,500 of which are surplus-labour, transforms into yarn.
It is immaterial here how much additional value in the form of
means of production is required in the various lines of industry by the
utilisation of additional labour. The point merely is that the part of
the money spent for means of production — the means of production bought
in M — MP — must absolutely suffice, i.e., must at the outset be calculated
accordingly, must be procured in corresponding proportion. To put it another
way, the quantity of means of production must suffice to absorb the amount
of labour, to be transformed by it into products. If the means of production
at hand were insufficient, the excess labour at the disposal of the purchaser
could not be utilised; his right to dispose of it is futile. If there were
more means of production than available labour, they would not be saturated
with labour, would not be transformed into products.
As soon as M — C<LMP is completed, the purchaser has at his disposal more than simply the means of production and labour-power required for the production of some useful article. He
disposes of a greater capacity to render labour-power fluent, or a greater
quantity of labour than is necessary for the replacement of the value of
this labour-power, and he has at the same time the means of production
requisite for the realisation or materialisation of this quantity of labour.
In other words, he has at his disposal the factors making for the production
of articles of a greater value than that of the elements of production — the factors of production of a mass of commodities containing surplus-value.
The value advanced by him in money-form has now assumed a bodily form in
which it can be incarnated as a value generating surplus-value (in the
shape of commodities). In brief, value exists here in the condition or
form of productive capital, which has the factor of creating value
and surplus-value. Let us call capital in this form P.
Now the value of P is equal to that of L + MP, it is equal to
M exchanged for L and MP. M is the same capital-value as P, only it has
a different mode of existence, it is capital-value in the state or form
of money — money-capital.
M — C<LMP, or its general form M — C, a sum of purchases of commodities, an act of the general circulation of commodities, is therefore at the same time — as a stage in the independent circuit of capital — a transformation of capital-value from its money-form into its productive form. More briefly, it is the transformation of money-capital into productive capital. In the diagram of the circuit which we
are here discussing, money appears as the first depository of capital-value,
and money-capital therefore represents the form in which capital is advanced.
Capital in the form of money-capital is in a state in which it
can perform the functions of money, in the present case the functions of
a universal means of purchase and universal means of payment. (The last-named
inasmuch as labour-power though first bought is not paid for until it has
been put into operation. To the extent that the means of production are
not found ready on the market but have to be ordered first, money in M — MP
likewise serves as a means of payment.) This capacity is not due to the
fact that money-capital is capital but that it is money.
On the other hand capital-value in the form of money cannot perform
any other functions but those of money. What turns the money-functions
into functions of capital is the definite role they play in the movement
of capital, and therefore also the interrelation of the stage in which
these functions are performed with the other stages of the circuit of capital.
Take, for instance, the case with which we are here dealing. Money is here
converted into commodities the combination of which represents the bodily
form of productive capital, and this form already contains latently, potentially,
the result of the process of capitalist production.
A part of the money performing the function of money-capital in
M — C<LMP assumes, by consummating the act of circulation, a function in which it loses its capital character but preserves its money-character. The circulation of money-capital M is divided into
M — MP and M — L, into the purchase of means of production and the purchase of labour-power. Let us consider the last-named process by itself. M — L
is the purchase of labour-power by the capitalist. It is also the sale
of labour-power — we may here say of labour, since the form of wages is
assumed — by the laborer who owns it. What is M — C ( = M — L) for the buyer is here, as in every other purchase, L — M ( = C — M) for the seller
(the laborer). It is the sale of his labour-power. This is the first stage
of circulation, or the first metamorphosis, of the commodity (Buch I, Kap.
III, 2a).[English edition: Ch. III, 2a — Ed.] It is for the seller
of labour a transformation of his commodity into the money-form. The laborer
spends the money so obtained gradually for a number of commodities required
for the satisfaction of his needs, for articles of consumption. The complete
circulation of his commodity therefore appears as L — M — C, that is to
say first as L — M ( = C — M) and secondly as M — C; hence in the general form of the simple circulation of commodities, C — M — C. Money is in this case merely a passing means of circulation, a mere medium in the exchange
of one commodity for another.
M — L is the characteristic moment in the transformation of money-capital
into productive capital, because it is the essential condition for the
real transformation of value advanced in the form of money into capital,
into a value producing surplus-value. M — MP is necessary only for the
purpose of realising the quantity of labour bought in the process M — L,
which was discussed from this point of view in Book I, Part II, under the
head of “The Transformation of Money into Capital.” We shall have to consider the matter at this point also from another angle, relating especially to
money-capital the form in which capital manifests itself.
Generally M — L is regarded as characteristic of the capitalist
mode of production. However not at all for the reason given above, that
the purchase of labour-power represents a contract of purchase which stipulates
for the delivery of a quantity of labour in excess of that needed to replace
the price of the labour-power, the wages; hence delivery of surplus-labour,
the fundamental condition for the capitalisation of the value advanced,
or for the production of surplus-value, which is the same thing. On the
contrary, it is so regarded because of its form, since money in the form
of wages buys labour, and this is the characteristic mark of the money
system.
Nor is it the irrationality of the form which is taken as characteristic.
On the contrary, one overlooks the irrational. The irrationality consists
in the fact that labour itself as a value-creating element cannot have
any value, nor can therefore any definite amount of labour have any value
expressed in its price, in its equivalence to a definite quantity of money.
But we know that wages are but a disguised form, a form in which for instance
the price of one day’s labour-power presents itself as the price of the
labour rendered fluent by this labour-power in one day. The value produced
by this labour-power in, say, six hours of labour is thus expressed as
the value of twelve hours’ functioning or operation of the labour-power.
M — L is regarded as the characteristic feature, the hallmark
of the so-called money system, because labour there appears as the commodity
of its owner, and money therefore as the buyer — hence on account of the
money-relation (i.e., the sale and purchase of human activity). Money however
appears very early as a buyer of so-called services, without the transformation
of M into money-capital, and without any change in the general character
of the economic system.
It makes no difference to money into what sort of commodities
it is transformed. It is the universal equivalent of all commodities which
show, if only by their prices, that ideally they represent a certain sum
of money, anticipate their transformation into money, and do not acquire
the form in which they may be converted into use-values for their owners
until they change places with money. Once labour-power has come into the
market as the commodity of its owner and its sale takes the form of payment
for labour, assumes the shape of wages, its purchase and sale is no more
startling than the purchase and sale of any other commodity. The characteristic
thing is not that the commodity labour-power is purchasable but that labour-power
appears as a commodity.
By means of M — C<LMP, the transformation of money-capital into productive capital, the capitalist effects the combination of the objective and personal factors of production so far as they consist of commodities. If money is transformed into productive capital for the
first time or if it performs for the first time the function of money-capital
for its owner, he must begin by buying means of production, such as buildings,
machinery, etc., before he buys any labour-power. For as soon as he compels
labour-power to act in obedience to his sway, he must have means of production
to which he can apply it as labour-power.
This is the capitalist’s presentation of the case.
The labourer’s case is as follows: The productive application
of his labour-power is not possible until it is sold and brought into connection
with means of production. Before its sale, labour-power exists therefore
separately from the means of production, from the material conditions of
its application. In this state of separation it cannot be used either directly
for the production of use-values for its owner or for the production of
commodities, by the sale of which he could live. But from the moment that
as a result of its sale it is brought into connection with means of production,
it forms part of the productive capital of its purchaser, the same as the
means of production.
True, in the act M — L the owner of money and the owner of labour-power
enter only into the relation of buyer and seller, confront one another
only as money-owner and commodity-owner. In this respect they enter merely
into a money-relation. Yet at the same time the buyer appears also from
the outset in the capacity of an owner of means of production, which are
the material conditions for the productive expenditure of labour-power
by its owner. In other words, these means of production are in opposition
to the owner of the labour-power, being property of another. On the other
hand the seller of labour faces its buyer as labour-power of another which
must be made to do his bidding, must be integrated into his capital, in
order that it may really become productive capital. The class relation
between capitalist and wage-laborer therefore exists, is presupposed from
the moment the two face each other in the act M — L (L — M on the part
of the laborer). It is a purchase and sale, a money-relation, but a purchase
and sale in which the buyer is assumed to be a capitalist and the seller
a wage-laborer. And this relation arises out of the fact that the conditions
required for the realisation of labour-power, viz., means of subsistence
and means of production, are separated from the owner of labour-power,
being the property of another.
We are not concerned here with the origin of this separation.
It exists as soon as M — L goes on. The thing which interests us here is
this: If M — L appears here as a function of money-capital or money as
the form of existence of capital, the sole reason that money here assumes
the role of a means of paying for a useful human activity or service; hence
by no means in consequence of the function of money as a means of payment.
Money can be expended in this form only because labour-power finds itself
in a state of separation from its means of production (including the means
of subsistence as means of production of the labour-power itself), and
because this separation can be overcome only by the sale of the labour-power
to the owner of the means of production; because therefore the functioning
of labour-power, which is not at all limited to the quantity of labour
required for the reproduction of its own price, is likewise the concern
of its buyer. The capital-relation during the process of production arises
only because it is inherent in the act of circulation, in the different
fundamental economic conditions in which buyer and seller confront each
other, in their class relation. It is not money which by its nature creates
this relation; it is rather the existence of this relation which permits
of the transformation of a mere money-function into a capital-function.
In the conception of money-capital (for the time being we deal
with the latter only within the confines of the special function in which
it faces us here) two errors run parallel to each other or cross each other.
In the first place the functions performed by capital-value in its capacity
as money-capital, which it can perform precisely owing to its money-form,
are erroneously derived from its character as capital, whereas they are
due only to the money-form of capital-value, to its form of appearance
as money. In the second place, on the contrary, the specific content of
the money-function, which renders it simultaneously a capital-function,
is traced to the nature of money (money being here confused with capital),
while the money function premises social conditions, such as are here indicated
by the act M — L, which do not at all exist in the mere circulation of
commodities and the corresponding circulation of money.
The purchase and sale of slaves is formally also a purchase and
sale of commodities. But money cannot perform this function without the
existence of slavery. If slavery exists, then money can be invested in
the purchase of slaves. On the other hand the mere possession of money
cannot make slavery possible.
In order that the sale of one’s own labour-power (in the form
of the sale of one’s own labour or in the form of wages) may constitute
not an isolated phenomenon but a socially decisive premise for the production
of commodities, in order that money-capital may therefore perform, on a
social scale , the above-discussed function M — C<LMP, historical processes are assumed by which the original connection of the means of production with labour-power was dissolved — processes in consequence of which the mass of the people, the labourers, have, as non-owners, come face to face with non-labourers as the owners of these means of production. It makes no difference in this case whether the connection before its dissolution was such in form that the laborer, being himself a means of production,
belonged to the other means of production or whether he was their owner.
What lies back of M — C<LMP is distribution; not distribution in the ordinary meaning of a distribution of articles of consumption, but the distribution of the elements of production itself,
the material factors of which are concentrated on one side, and labour-power,
isolated, on the other.
The means of production, the material part of productive capital,
must therefore face the laborer as such, as capital, before the act M — L
can become a universal, social one.
We have seen on previous occasions [English edition: Karl Marx,
Capital, Vol. I, Part VII, Moscow, 1954. — Ed.] that in
its further development capitalist production, once it is established,
not only reproduces this separation but extends its scope further and further
until it becomes the prevailing condition. However, there is still another
side to this question. In order that capital may be able to arise and take
control of production, a definite stage in the development of trade is
assumed. This applies therefore also to the circulation of commodities,
and hence to the production of commodities; for no articles can enter circulation
as commodities unless they are produced for sale, hence as commodities.
But the production of commodities does not become the normal, dominant
type of production until capitalist production serves as its basis.
The Russian landowners, who as a result of the so-called emancipation
of the peasants are now compelled to carry on agriculture with the help
of wage-labourers instead of the forced labour of serfs, complain about
two things: First, about the lack of money-capital. They say for instance
that comparatively large sums must be paid to wage-labourers before the
crops are sold, and just then there is a dearth of ready cash, the prime
condition. Capital in the form of money must always be available, particularly
for the payment of wages, before production can be carried on capitalistically.
But the landowners may take hope. Everything comes to those who wait, and
in due time the industrial capitalist will have at his disposal not alone
his own money but also that of others.
The second complaint is more characteristic. It is to the effect
that even if one has money, not enough labourers are to be had at any time.
The reason is that the Russian farm-laborer, owing to the common ownership
of land in the village community, has not yet been fully separated from
his means of production and hence is not yet a “free wage-laborer” in the
full sense of the word. But the existence of the latter on a social scale
is a sine qua non for M — C, the conversion of money into commodities,
to be able to represent the transformation of money-capital into productive
capital.
It is therefore quite clear that the formula for the circuit of
money-capital, M — C ... C' — M', is the matter-of-course form of the circuit
of capital only on the basis of already developed capitalist production,
because it presupposes the existence of a class of wage-labourers on a
social scale. We have seen that capitalist production does not only create
commodities and surplus-value, but also reproduces to an ever increasing
extent the class of wage-labourers, into whom it transforms the vast majority
of direct producers. Since the first condition for its realisation is the
permanent existence of a class of wage-labourers, M — C ... P ... C' — M'
presupposes a capital in the form of productive capital, and hence the
form of the circuit of productive capital.


II. Second Stage. Function of Productive Capital

The circuit of capital, which we have here considered, begins with the
act of circulation M — C, the transmutation of money into commodities —
purchase. Circulation must therefore be complemented by the antithetical
metamorphosis C — M, the transformation of commodities into money — sale. But the direct result of M — C<LMP is the interruption of the circulation of the capital-value advanced in the form of money. By the transformation of money-capital into productive capital the capital-value has acquired a bodily form in which it cannot continue to circulate but
must enter into consumption, viz., into productive consumption. The use
of labour-power, labour, can be materialised only in the labour-process.
The capitalist cannot resell the laborer as a commodity because he is not
his chattel slave and the capitalist has not bought anything except the
right to use his labour-power for a certain time. On the other hand the
capitalist cannot use this labour-power in any other way than by utilising
means of production to create commodities with its help. The result of
the first stage is therefore entrance into the second, the productive stage
of capital.
This movement is represented by M — C<LMP ... P, in which the dots indicate that the circulation of capital is interrupted, while its circular movement continues, since it passes from the sphere of circulation of commodities into that of production. The first stage,
the transformation of money-capital into productive capital, is therefore
merely the harbinger and introductory phase of the second stage, the functioning
of productive capital.
M — C<LMP presupposes that the individual performing this act not only has at his disposal values in any use-form, but also that he has them in the form of money, that he is the owner of
money. But as the act consists precisely in giving away money, the individual
can remain the owner of money only in so far as the act of giving away
implies a return of money. But money can return to him only through the
sale of commodities. Hence the above act assumes him to be a producer of
commodities.
M — L. The wage-laborer lives only by the sale of his labour-power.
Its preservation — his preservation — requires daily consumption. Hence
payment for it must be continuously repeated at rather short intervals in order that he may be able to repeat acts L — M — C or C — M — C, repeat
the purchases needed for his self-preservation. For this reason the capitalist
must always meet the wage-laborer in the capacity of a money-capitalist,
and his capital as money-capital. On the other hand if the wage-labourers,
the mass of direct producers, are to perform the act L — M — C, they must
constantly be faced with the necessary means of subsistence in purchasable
form, i.e., in the form of commodities. This state of affairs necessitates
a high degree of development of the circulation of products in the form
of commodities, hence also of the volume of commodities produced. When
production by means of wage-labour becomes universal, commodity production
is bound to be the general form of production. This mode of production,
once it is assumed to be general, carries in its wake an ever increasing
division of social labour, that is to say an ever growing differentiation
of the articles which are produced in the form of commodities by a definite
capitalist, ever greater division of complementary processes of production
into independent processes. M — MP therefore develops to the same extent
as M — L does, that is to say the production of means of production is
divorced to that extent from the production of commodities whose means
of production they are. And the latter then stand opposed to every producer
of commodities which he does not produce but buys for his particular process
of production. They come from branches of production which, operated independently,
are entirely divorced from his own, enter into his own branch as commodities,
and must therefore be bought. The material conditions of commodity production
face him more and more as products of other commodity producers, as commodities.
And to the same extent the capitalist must assume the role of money-capitalist,
in other words there is an increase in the scale on which his capital must
assume the functions of money-capital.
On the other hand, the same conditions which give rise to the
basic condition of capitalist production, the existence of a class of wage-workers,
facilitate the transition of all commodity production to capitalist commodity
production. As capitalist production develops, it has a disintegrating,
resolvent effect on all older forms of production, which, designed mostly
to meet the direct needs of the producer, transform only the excess produced
into commodities. Capitalist production makes the sale of products the
main interest, at first apparently without affecting the mode of production
itself. Such was for instance the first effect of capitalist world commerce
on such nations as the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, etc. But, secondly, wherever
it takes root capitalist production destroys all forms of commodity production
which are based either on the self-employment of the producers, or merely
on the sale of the excess product as commodities. Capitalist production
first makes the production of commodities general and then, by degrees,
transforms all commodity production into capitalist commodity production.
[3]
Whatever the social form of production, labourers and means of
production always remain factors of it. But in a state of separation from
each other either of these factors can be such only potentially. For production
to go on at all they must unite. The specific manner in which this union
is accomplished distinguishes the different economic epochs of the structure
of society from one another. In the present case, the separation of the
free worker from his means of production is the starting-point given, and
we have seen how and under what conditions these two elements are united
in the hands of the capitalist, namely, as the productive mode of existence
of his capital. The actual process which the personal and material creators
of commodities enter upon when thus brought together, the process of production,
becomes therefore itself a function of capital, the capitalist process
of production, the nature of which has been fully analysed in the first
book of this work. Every enterprise engaged in commodity production becomes
at the same time an enterprise exploiting labour-power. But only the capitalist
production of commodities has become an epoch-making mode of exploitation,
which, in the course of its historical development, revolutionises, through
the organisation of the labour-process and the enormous improvement of
technique, the entire structure of society in a manner eclipsing all former
epochs.
The means of production and labour-power, in so far as they are
forms of existence of advanced capital-value, are distinguished by the
different roles assumed by them during the process of production in the
creation of value, hence also of surplus-value, into constant and variable
capital. Being different components of productive capital they are furthermore
distinguished by the fact that the means of production in the possession
of the capitalist remain his capital even outside of the process of production,
while labour-power becomes the form of existence of an individual capital
only within this process. Whereas labour-power is a commodity only in the
hands of its seller, the wage-labourer, it becomes capital only in the
hands of its buyer, the capitalist who acquires the temporary use of it.
The means of production do not become the material forms of productive
capital, or productive capital, until labour-power, the personal form of
existence of productive capital, is capable of being embodied in them.
Human labour-power is by nature no more capital than by means of production.
They acquire this specific social character only under definite, historically
developed conditions, just as only under such conditions the character
of money is stamped upon precious metals, or that of money-capital upon
money.
Productive capital, in performing its functions, consumes its
own component parts for the purpose of transforming them into a mass of
products of a higher value. Since labour-power acts merely as one of its
organs, the excess of the product’s value engendered by its surplus-labour
over and above the value of productive capital’s constituent elements is
also the fruit of capital. The surplus-labour of labour-power is the gratuitous
labour performed for capital and thus forms surplus-value for the capitalist,
a value which costs him no equivalent return. The product is therefore
not only a commodity, but a commodity pregnant with surplus-value. Its
value is equal to P + s, that is to say equal to the value of the productive
capital P consumed in the production of the commodity plus the surplus
values created by it. Let us assume that this commodity consists of 10,000
lbs. of yarn, and that means of production worth £372 and labour
power worth £50 were consumed in the fabrication of this quantity
of yarn. During the process of spinning, the spinners transmitted to the
yarn the value of the means of production consumed by their labour, amounting
to £372, and at the same time they created, in proportion with the
labour-power expended by them, new value to the amount of, say, £128.
The 10,000 lbs. of yarn therefore represent a value of £500.

III. Third Stage. C' — M'

Commodities become commodity-capital as a functional form of
existence — stemming directly from the process of production itself —
of capital-value which has already produced surplus-value. If the production
of commodities were carried on capitalistically throughout society, all
commodities would be elements of commodity-capital from the outset, whether
they were crude iron, Brussels lace, sulphuric acid or cigars. The problem
of what kinds of commodities, is one of the self-created lovely ills of
scholastic political economy.
Capital in the form of commodities has to perform the function
of commodities. The articles of which capital is composed are produced
especially for the market and must be sold, transformed into money, hence
go through the process C — M.
Suppose the commodity of the capitalist to consist of 10,000 lbs.
of cotton yarn. If £372 represent the value of the means of production
consumed in the spinning process, and new value to the amount of £128
has been created, the yarn has a value of £500, which is expressed
in its price of the same amount. Suppose further that this price is realised
by the sale C — M. What is it that makes of this simple act of all commodity
circulation at the same time a capital-function? No change that takes place
inside of it, neither in the use-character of the commodity — for it passes
into the hands of the buyer as an object of use — nor in its value, for
this value has not experienced any change of magnitude, but only of form.
It first existed in the form of yarn, while now it exists in the form of
money. Thus a substantial distinction is evident between the first stage
M — C and the last stage C — M. There the advanced money functions as money-capital, because it is transformed by means of the circulation into commodities
of a specific use-value. Here the commodities can serve as capital only
to the extent that they bring this character with them in ready shape from
the process of production before their circulation begins. During the spinning
process, the spinners create yarn value to the amount of £128. Of
this sum, say £50 represent to the capitalist merely an equivalent
for his outlay for labour-power, while £78 — when the degree of
exploitation of labour-power is 156 per cent — form surplus-value. The
value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn therefore embodies first the value of
the consumed productive capital P, the constant part of which amounts to

£372 and the variable to £50, their sum being £422, equal
to 8,440 lbs. of yarn. Now the value of the productive capital P is equal
to C, the value of its constituent elements, which in the stage M — C confronted
the capitalist as commodities in the hands of their sellers.
In the second place, however, the value of the yarn contains a
surplus-value of £78, equal to 1,560 lbs. of yarn. C as an expression
of the value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn is therefore equal to C plus DC,
or C plus an increment of C (equal to £78), which we shall call c,
since it exists in the same commodity-form as now the original value C.
The value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn, equal to £500, is therefore
represented by C + c = C'. What turns C, the expression of the value of
10,000 lbs. of yarn, into C' is not the absolute magnitude of its value
(£500), for that is determined, as in the case of any other C standing
for the expression of the value of some other sum of commodities, by the
quantity of labour embodied in it. It is its relative value-magnitude,
its value-magnitude as compared with that of capital P consumed in its
production. This value is contained in it plus the surplus-value supplied
by the productive capital. Its value is greater, exceeds that of the capital-value
by this surplus-value c. The 10,000 lbs. of yarn are the bearers of the
capital-value expanded, enriched by this surplus-value, and they are so
by virtue of being the product of the capitalist process of production.
C' expresses a value-relation, the relation of the value of the commodities
produced to that of the capital spent on their production, in other words,
expresses the fact that its value is composed of capital-value and surplus-value.
The 10,000 lbs. of yarn represent commodity capital, C', only because they
are a converted form of the productive capital P, hence in a connection
which exists originally only in the circuit of this individual capital,
or only for the capitalist who produced the yarn with the help of his capital.
It is, so to say, only an internal, not an external relation that turns the 10,000 lbs. of yarn in their capacity of vehicles of value into a commodity-capital. They exhibit their capitalist birthmark not in the absolute magnitude of their value but in its relative magnitude, in the magnitude of their value as compared with that possessed by the productive capital embodied in them before it was transformed into commodities. If,
then, these 10,000 lbs. of yarn are sold at their value of £500,
this act of circulation, considered by itself, is identical with C — M,
a mere transformation of an unchanging value from the form of a commodity
into that of money. But as a special stage in the circuit of an individual
capital, the same act is a realisation of the capital-value embodied in
the commodity to the amount of £422 plus the surplus-value, likewise
embodied in it, of £78. That is to say it represents C' — M', the
transformation of the commodity-capital from its commodity-form into the
money form. [4]
The function of C' is now that of all commodities, viz.: to transform
itself into money, to be sold, to go through the circulation stage C — M.
So long as the capital, now expanded, remains in the form of commodity-capital,
lies immovable in the market, the process of production is at rest. The
commodity-capital acts neither as a creator of products nor as a creator
of value. A given capital-value will serve, in widely different degrees,
as a creator of products and value, and the scale of reproduction will
be extended or reduced commensurate with the particular speed with which
that capital throws off its commodity-form and assumes that of money, or
with the rapidity of the sale. It was shown in Book I that the degree of
efficiency of any given capital is conditional on the potentialities of
the productive process, which to a certain extent are independent of the
magnitude of its own value. [English edition: Karl Marx, Capital,
Vol. I, pp. 602-08. — Ed.] Here it appears that the process of
circulation sets in motion new forces independent of the capital’s magnitude
of value and determining its degree of efficiency, its expansion and contraction.
The mass of commodities C', being the depository of the expanded
capital, must furthermore pass in its entirety through the metamorphosis
C' — M'. The quantity sold is here a main determinant. The individual commodity
figures only as an integral part of the total mass. The £500 worth
of value exists in the 10,000 lbs. of yarn. If the capitalist succeeds
in selling only 7,440 lbs. at their value of £372, he has replaced
only the value of his constant capital, the value of the expanded means
of production. If he sells 8,440 lbs. he recovers only the value of the
total capital advanced. He must sell more in order to realise some surplus-value,
and he must sell the entire 10,000 lbs. in order to realise the surplus-value
of £78 (1,560 lbs. of yarn). In £500 in money he receives merely
an equivalent for the commodity sold. His transaction within the circulation
is simply C — M. If he had paid his labourers £64 in wages instead
of £50 his surplus-value would only be £64 instead of £78,
and the degree of exploitation would have been only 100 per cent instead
of 156. But the value of the yarn would not change; only the relation between
its component parts would be different. The circulation act C — M would
still represent the sale of 10,000 lbs. of yarn for £500, their value.
C' is equal to C + c (or £422 at £78). C equals the
value of P, the productive capital, and this equals the value of M, the
money advanced in M — C, the purchase of the elements of production, amounting
to £422 in our example. If the mass of commodities is sold at its
value, then C equals £422 and c equals £78, the value of the
surplus-product of 1,560 lbs. of yarn. If we call c, expressed in money,
m, then C' — M' = (C + c) - (M + m), and the circuit M — C ... P ... C' — M', 
in its expanded form, is therefore represented by  
M — C<LMP ... P ... (C + c) - (M + m).
In the first stage the capitalist takes articles of consumption
out of the commodity-market proper and the labour-market. In the third
stage he throws commodities back, but only into one market, the commodity-market
proper. However the fact that he extracts from the market, by means of
his commodities, a greater value than he threw upon it originally is due
only to the circumstance that he throws more commodity-value back upon
it than he first drew out of it. He threw value M upon it and drew out
of it the equivalent C; he throws C + c back upon it, and draws out of
it the equivalent M + m.
M was in our example equal to the value of 8,440 lbs. of yarn.
But he throws 10,000 lbs. of yarn on the market, consequently he returns
a greater value than he took from it. On the other hand he threw this increased
value on the market only because through the exploitation of labour-power
in the process of production he had created surplus-value (as an aliquot
part of the product expressed in surplus-product). It is only by virtue
of being the product of this process that the mass of commodities becomes
commodity-capital, the bearer of the expanded capital-value. By performing
C' — M' the advanced capital-value as well as the surplus-value are realised.
The realisation of both takes place simultaneously in a series of sales
or in a lump sale of the entire mass of commodities which is expressed
by C' — M'. But the same circulation act C' — M' is different for capital-value
and surplus-value, as it expresses for each of them a different stage of
their circulation, a different section of the series of metamorphoses through
which they must pass in the sphere of circulation. The surplus-value c
came into the world only during the process of production. It appeared
for the first time in the commodity-market, in the form of commodities.
This is its first form of circulation, hence the act c — m is its first
circulation act, or its first metamorphosis, which remains to be supplemented
by the antithetical act of circulation, or the reverse metamorphosis, m — c.
[5]
It is different with the circulation which the capital-value C
performs in the same circulation act C' — M', and which constitutes for
the circulation act C — M, in which C is equal to P, equal to the M originally
advanced. Capital-value has opened its first circulation act in the form
of M, money-capital, and returns through the act C — M to the same form.
It has therefore passed through the two antithetical stages of circulation,
first M — C, second C — M, and finds itself once more in the form in which
it can begin its circular movement anew. What for surplus-value constitutes
the first transformation of the commodity-form into that of money, constitutes
for capital-value in return, or retransformation, into its original money-form.
By means of M — C<LMP money capital is transformed into an equivalent mass of commodities, L and MP. These commodities no longer perform the function of commodities, of articles for sale. Their value is now in the hands of the capitalist who bought them; they represent
the value of his productive capital P. And in the function of P, productive
consumption, they are transformed into a kind of commodity differing materially
from the means of production, into yarn, in which their value is not only
preserved but increased, from £422 to £500. By means of this
real metamorphosis, the commodities taken from the market in the first
stage, M — C, are replaced by commodities of different substance and value,
which now must perform the function of commodities, must be transformed
into money and sold. The process of production therefore appears to be
only an interruption of the process of circulation of capital-value, of
which up to that point only the first phase, M — C, has been passed through.
It passes through the second and concluding phase, C — M, after C has been
altered in substance and value. But so far as capital-value, considered
by itself, is concerned, it has merely suffered an alteration of its use-form
in the process of production. It existed in the form of £422 worth
of L and MP, while now it exists in the form of £422 worth of, or
8,440 lbs. of yarn. If we therefore consider merely the two circulation
phases of capital-value, apart from its surplus-value, we find that it
passes through 1) M — C and 2) C — M, in which the second C has a different
use-form but the same value as the first C. Hence it passes through M — C — M, a form of circulation which, because the commodity here changes place twice and in the opposite direction — transformation from money into commodities and from commodities into money — necessitates the return of the value advanced in the form of money to its money-form — its reconversion into money.
The same circulation act C' — M' that constitutes the second and
concluding metamorphosis, a return to the money-form, for the capital-value
advanced in money, represents for the surplus-value — borne along by the
commodity-capital and simultaneously realised by its change into the money-form
— its first metamorphosis, its transformation from the commodity- to the
money-form, C — M, its first circulation phase.
We have, then, two kinds of observations to make here. First,
the ultimate reconversion of capital-value into its original money-form
is a function of commodity-capital. Secondly, this function includes the
first transformation of surplus-value from its original commodity-form
to its money-form. The money-form, then, plays a double role here. On the
one hand it is the form to which a value originally advanced in money returns,
hence a return to the form of value which opened the process. On the other
hand it is the first converted form of a value which originally enters
the circulation in commodity-form. If the commodities composing the commodity-capital
are sold at their values, as we assume, then C plus c is transformed into
M plus m, its equivalent. The realised commodity-capital now exists in
the hands of the capitalist in this form: M plus m (£422 plus £78 = £500). Capital-value and surplus-value are now present in the form of money, the
form of the universal equivalent.
At the conclusion of the process capital-value has therefore resumed
the form in which it entered it, and as money-capital can now open and
go through a new process. Just because the initial and final forms of this
process are those of money-capital, M, we call this form of the circulation
process the circuit of money-capital. It is not the form but merely the
magnitude of the advanced value that is changed at the close.
M plus m is nothing but a sum of money of a definite magnitude,
in this case £500. But as a result of the circulation of capital,
as realised commodity-capital, this sum of money contains the capital-value
and the surplus-value. And these values are now no longer inseparably united
as they were in the yarn; they now lie side by side. Their sale has given
both of them an independent money-form; 211/250 of this money represent
the capital-value of £422 and 39/250 constitute the surplus-value
of £78. This separation, effected by the realisation of the commodity-capital,
has not only the formal content to which we shall refer presently. It becomes
important in the process of the reproduction of capital, depending on whether
m is entirely or partially or not at all lumped together with M, i.e.,
depending on whether or not it continues to function as a component part
of the advanced capital-value. Both m and M may pass through quite different
processes of circulation.
In M' capital has returned to its original form M, to its money-form,
a form however in which it is materialised as capital.
There is in the first place a difference of quantity. It was M,
£422. It is now M', £500, and this difference is expressed
by M ... M', the quantitatively different extremes of the circuit, whose
movement is indicated only by the three dots. M' > M, and M' - M = s, the
surplus-value. But as a result of this circular movement M ... M' it is
only M' which exists now; it is the product in which its process of formation
has become extinct. M' now exists by itself, independently of the movement
which brought it into existence. That movement is gone; M' is there in
its place.
But M', being M plus m, £500, composed of £422 advanced
capital plus an increment of the same amounting to £78, represents
at the same time a qualitative relation, although this qualitative relation
itself exists only as a relation between the parts of one and the same
sum, hence as a quantitative relation. M, the advanced capital, which is
now once more present in its original form (£422), exists as realised
capital. It has not only preserved itself but also realised itself as capital
by being distinguished as such from m (£78), to which it stands in
the same relation as to an increase of its own, to a fruit of
its own, to an increment to which it has given birth itself. It has
been realised as capital because it has been realised as a value which
has created value. M' exists as a capital-relation. M no longer appears
as mere money, but expressly plays the part of money-capital, expressed
as a self-expanded value, hence possessing the property of self-expansion,
of hatching a higher value than it itself has. M became capital by virtue
of its relation to the other part of M', which it has brought about, which
has been effected by it as the cause, which is the consequence of it as
the ground. Thus M' appears as the sum of values differentiated within
itself, functionally (conceptually) distinguished within itself, expressing
the capital-relation.
But this is expressed only as a result, without the intervention
of the process of which it is the result.
Parts of value as such are not qualitatively different from one
another, except in so far as they appear as values of different articles,
of concrete things, hence in various use-forms and therefore as values
of different commodities — a difference which does not originate with
them themselves as mere parts of value. In money all differences between
commodities are extinguished, because it is the equivalent form common
to all of them. A sum of money in the amount of £500 consists solely
of uniform elements of £1 each. Since the intermediate links of its
origin are obliterated in the simple existence of this sum of money and
every trace has been lost of the specific difference between the different
component parts of capital in the process of production, there exists now
only the distinction between the conceptual form of a principal equal to £422, the capital advanced, and an excess value of £78. Let
M' be equal to, say, £110, of which £100 may be equal to M,
the principal, and 10 equal to s, the surplus-value. There is an absolute
homogeneity, an absence of conceptual distinctions, between the two constituent
parts of the sum of £110. Any £10 of this sum always constitute
1/11 of the total sum of £1/10, whether they are 1/10 of the advanced
principal of £100 or the excess of £10 above it. Principal
and excess sum, capital and surplus-sum, may therefore be expressed as
fractional parts of the total sum. In our illustration, 10/11 form the
principal, or the capital, and 1/11 the surplus sum. In its money-expression
realised capital appears therefore at the end of its process as an irrational
expression of the capital-relation.
True, this applies also to C' (C plus c). But there is this difference:
that C', of which C and c are only proportional value-parts of the same
homogeneous mass of commodities, indicates its origin P, whose immediate
product it is, while in M', a form derived directly from circulation, the
direct relation to P is obliterated.
The irrational distinction between the principal and the incremental
sum, which is contained in M', so far as that expresses the result of the
movement M ... M', disappears as soon as it once more functions actively
as money-capital and is therefore not fixed as a money-expression of expanded
industrial capital. The circuit of capital can never begin with M' (although
M' now performs the function of M). It can begin only with M, that is to
say it can never begin as an expression of the capital-relation, but only
as a form of advance of capital-value. As soon as the £500 are once
more advanced as capital, in order again to produce s, they constitute
a point of departure, not one of return. Instead of a capital of £422,
a capital of £500 is now advanced. It is more money than before,
more capital-value, but the relation between its two constituent parts
has disappeared. In fact a sum of £500 instead of the £422
might originally have served as capital.
It is not an active function of money-capital to appear as M';
to appear as M' is rather a function of C'. Even in the simple circulation
of commodities, first in C1 — M, secondly in M — C2, money M does not figure actively until the second act, M — C2. Its appearance in the form of M is only the result of the first act, by virtue of which it only then appears as a converted form of C1. True, the capital-relation contained in M', the relation of one of its
parts as the capital-value to the other as its value increment, acquires
functional importance in so far as, with the constantly repeated circuit
M ... M', M' splits into two circulations, one of them a circulation of
capital, the other of surplus-value. Consequently these two parts perform
not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different functions, M others
than m. But considered by itself, the form M ... M' does not include what
the capitalist consumes, but explicitly only the self-expansion and accumulation,
so far as the latter expresses itself above all as a periodical augmentation
of ever renewed advances of money-capital.
Although M', equal to M plus m, is the irrational form of capital,
it is at the same time only money-capital in its realised form, in the
form of money which has generated money. But this is different from the
function of money-capital in the first stage, 
M — C<LMP.
In the first stage, M circulates as money. It assumes the functions of
money-capital because only in its money state can it perform a money-function,
can it transform itself into the elements of P, into L and MP, which stand
opposed to it as commodities. In this circulation act it functions only
as money. But as this act is the first stage of capital-value in process,
it is simultaneously a function of money-capital, by virtue of the specific
use-form of the commodities L and MP which are bought. M' on the other
hand, composed of M, the capital-value, and m, the surplus-value begotten
of M, stands for self-expanded capital-value — the purpose and the outcome,
the function of the total circuit of capital. The fact that it expresses
this outcome in the form of money, as realised money-capital, does not
derive from its being the money-form of capital, money-capital,
but on the contrary from its being money-capital, capital in the
form of money, from capital having opened the process in this form, from
its having been advanced in the money-form. Its reconversion into the money-form
is, as we have seen, a function of commodity-capital C', not of money-capital.
As for the difference between M and M', it (m) is simply the money-form
of c, the increment of C. M' is composed of M plus m only because C' was
composed of C plus c. In C' therefore this difference and the relation
of the capital-value to the surplus-value generated by it is present and
expressed before both of them are transformed into M', into a sum of money
in which both parts of the value come face to face with each other independently
and may, therefore, be employed in separate and distinct functions.
M' is only the result of the realisation of C'. Both M' and C'
are merely different forms of self-expanded capital-value, one of them
the commodity-form, the other the money-form. Both of them have this in
common: that they are self-expanded capital-value. Both of them are materialised
capital, because capital-value as such exists here together with the surplus-value,
the fruit obtained through it and differing from it, although this relation
is expressed only in the irrational form of the relation between two parts
of a sum of money or of a commodity-value. But as expressions of capital
in relation and contradistinction to the surplus-value produced by it,
hence as expressions of self-expanded value, M' and C' are the same and
express the same thing, only in different forms. They do not differ as
money-capital and commodity-capital but as money and commodities. In so
far as they represent self-expanded value, capital acting as capital, they
only express the result of the functioning of productive capital, the only
function in which capital-value generates value. What they have in common
is that both of them, money-capital as well as commodity-capital, are modes
of existence of capital. The one is capital in money-form, the other in
commodity-form. The specific functions that distinguish them cannot therefore
be anything else but differences between the functions of money and of
commodities. Commodity-capital, the direct product of the capitalist process
of production, is reminiscent of its origin and is therefore more rational
and less incomprehensible in form than money-capital, in which every trace
of this process has vanished, as in general all special use-forms of commodities
disappear in money. It is therefore only when M' itself functions as commodity-capital,
when it is the direct product of a productive process instead of being
the converted form of this product, that it loses its bizarre form, that
is to say, in the production of the money material itself. In the production
of gold for instance the formula would be M — C<LMP ... P ... M' (M plus m), where M' would figure as a commodity product, because P furnishes more gold than was advanced for the elements of production of the gold in the first M, the money-capital. In this case the irrational
nature of the expression M ... M' (M plus m) disappears. Here a part of
a sum of money appears as the mother of another part of the same sum of money.

IV. The Circuit as a Whole

We have seen that the process of circulation is interrupted at the end
of its first phase, M — C<LMP, by P, in which the commodities L and MP bought in the market are consumed as the material and value components of productive capital. The product of this consumption is a new commodity, C', altered in respect of substance and value. The
interrupted process of circulation, M — C, must be completed by C — M.
But the bearer of this second and concluding phase of circulation is C',
a commodity different in substance and value from the original C. The circulation
series therefore appears as 1) M — C1; 2) C'2 — M', where in the second phase of the first commodity, C1, another commodity of greater value and different use-form, C'2, is substituted during the interruption caused by the functioning of P, the production of C' from the elements of C, the forms of existence of productive
capital P. However, the first form of appearance in which capital faced
us (Buch. I, Kap. IV, 1), [English edition: Ch. IV. — Ed.] viz.,
M — C — M' (extended: 1) M — C1; 2) C1 — M') shows the same commodity twice. Both times it is the same commodity into which money is transformed in the first phase and reconverted into more money in the second phase. In spite of this essential difference, both circulations
share this much: that in their first phase money is transformed into commodities,
and in the second commodities into money, that the money spent in the first
phase returns in the second. On the one hand both have in common this reflux
of the money to its starting-point, on the other hand also the excess of
the returning money over the money advanced. To that extent the formula
M — C ... C' — M' is contained in the general formula M — C — M'.
It follows furthermore that each time equally great quantities
of simultaneously existing values face and replace each other in the two
metamorphoses M — C and C' — M' belonging in circulation. The change in
value pertains exclusively to the metamorphosis P, the process of production,
which thus appears as a real metamorphosis of capital, as compared with
the merely metamorphosis of circulation.
Let us now consider the total movement, M — C ... P ... C' — M',
or, M — C<LMP
 ... P ... C' (C + c) — M' (M + m), its more expanded form. Capital here appears as a value which goes through a series of interconnected, interdependent transformations, a series of metamorphoses which form just as many phases, or stages, of the process
as a whole. Two of these phases belong in the sphere of circulation, one
of them in that of production. In each one of these phases capital-value
has a different form for which there is a correspondingly different, special
function. Within this movement the advanced value does not only preserve
itself but grows, increases in magnitude. Finally, in the concluding stage,
it returns to the same form which it had at the beginning of the process
as a whole. This process as a whole constitutes therefore the process of
moving in circuits.
The two forms assumed by capital-value at the various stages of
its circulation are those of money-capital and commodity-capital. The form pertaining to the stage of production is that of productive
capital. The capital which assumes these forms in the course of its
total circuit and then discards them and in each of them performs the function
corresponding to the particular form, is industrial capital, industrial
here in the sense it comprises every branch of industry run on a capitalist
basis.
Money-capital, commodity-capital and productive capital, do not
therefore designate independent kinds of capital whose functions form the
content of likewise independent branches of industry separated from one
another. They denote here only special functional forms of industrial capital,
which assumes all three of them one after the other.
Capital describes its circuit normally only so long as its various
phases pass uninterruptedly into one another. If capital stops short in
the first phase M — C, money-capital assumes the rigid form of a hoard;
if it stops in the phase of production, the means of production lie without
functioning on the one side, while labour-power remains unemployed on the
other; and if capital stops short in the last phase C' — M', piles of unsold
commodities accumulate and clog the flow of circulation.
However, it is in the nature of things that the circuit itself
necessitates the fixation of capital for certain lengths of time in its
various phases. In each of its phases industrial capital is tied up with
a definite form: money-capital, productive capital, commodity-capital.
It does not acquire the form in which it may enter a new transformation
phase until it has performed the function corresponding to each particular
form. To make this plain, we have assumed in our illustration that the
capital-value of the quantity of commodities created at the stage of production
is equal to the total sum of the value originally advanced in the form
of money; or, in other words, that the entire capital-value advanced in
the form of money passes on in bulk from one stage to the next. But we have
seen (Buch I, Kap. VI) [English edition: Ch. VIII. — Ed.] that
a part of constant capital, the labour instruments proper (e.g., machinery),
continually serve anew, with more or less numerous repetitions of the same
process of production, hence transfer their values piecemeal to the products.
It will be seen later to what extent this circumstance modifies the circular
movement of capital. For the present the following suffices: In our illustration
the value of productive capital amounting to £422 contained only
the average wear and tear of factory buildings, machinery, etc., that is
to say only that part of value which they transferred to the yarn in the
transformation of 10,600 lbs. of cotton into 10,000 lbs. of yarn, which
represented the product of one week’s spinning of 60 hours. In the means
of production, into which the advanced constant capital of £372 was
transformed, the instruments of labour, buildings, machinery, etc., figured
as if they had only been rented in the market at a weekly rate. But this
does not change the gist of the matter in any way. We have but to multiply
the quantity of yarn produced in one week, i.e., 10,000 lbs. of yarn, by
the number of weeks contained in a certain number of years, in order to
transfer to the yarn the entire value of the instruments of labour bought
and consumed during this period. It is then plain that the advanced money-capital
must first be transformed into these instruments, hence must have gone
through the first phase M — C before it can function as productive capital
P. And it is likewise plain in our illustration that the capital value
of £422, embodied in the yarn during the process of production, cannot
be part of the value of the 10,000 lbs. of yarn and enter the circulation
phase C' — M' until it is ready. It cannot be sold until it has been spun.
In the general formula the product P is regarded as a material
thing different from the elements of the productive capital, as an object
existing apart from the process of production and having a use-form different
from that of the elements of production. This is always the case when the
result of the productive process assumes the form of a thing, even when
a part of the product re-enters the resumed production as one of its elements.
Grain for instance serves as seed for its own production, but the product
consists only of grain and hence has a shape different from those of related
elements such as labour-power, implements, fertiliser. But there are certain
independent branches of industry in which the product of the productive
process is not a new material product, is not a commodity. Among these
only the communications industry, whether engaged in transportation proper,
of goods and passengers, or in the mere transmission of communications,
letters, telegrams, etc., is economically important.
A. Chuprov [6] says on this score:
“The manufacturer
may first produce articles and then look for consumers”
[his product, thrust out of the process of production when finished, passes into circulation as a commodity separated from it].
“Production and consumption thus appear
as two acts separated in space and time. In the transportation industry,
which does not create any new products but merely transfer men and things,
these two acts coincide; its services” [change of place] “are consumed
the moment they are produced. For this reason the area within which railways
can sell their services extends at best 50 versts (53 kilometres) on either
side of their tracks.”
The result, whether men or goods are transported, is a change
in their whereabouts. Yarn, for instance, may now be in India instead of
in England, where it was produced.
However, what the transportation industry sells is change of location.
The useful effect is inseparably connected with the process of transportation,
i.e., the productive process of the transport industry. Men and goods travel
together with the means of transportation, and their traveling, this locomotion,
constitutes the process of production effected by these means. The useful
effect can be consumed only during this process of production. It does
not exist as a utility different from this process, a use-thing which does
not function as an article of commerce, does not circulate as a commodity,
until after it has been produced. But the exchange-value of this useful
effect is determined, like that of any other commodity, by the value of
the elements of production (labour-power and means of production) consumed
in it plus the surplus-value created by the surplus-labour of the labourers
employed in transportation. This useful effect also entertains the very
same relations to consumption that other commodities do. If it is consumed
individually its value disappears during its consumption; if it is consumed
productively so as to constitute by itself a stage in the production of
the commodities being transported, its value is transferred as an additional
value to the commodity itself. The formula for the transport industry would
therefore be M — C<LMP
 ... P — M', since it is the process of production itself that is paid for and consumed, not a product separate and distinct from it. Hence this formula has almost the same form
as that of the production of precious metals, the only difference being
that in this case M' represents the converted form of the useful effect
created during the process of production, and not the bodily form of the
gold or silver produced in this process and extruded from it.
Industrial capital is the only mode of existence of capital in
which not only the appropriation of surplus-value, or surplus-product,
but simultaneously its creation is a function of capital. Therefore with
it the capitalist character of production is a necessity. Its existence
implies the class antagonism between capitalists and wage-labourers. To
the extent that it seizes control of social production, the technique and
social organisation of the labour-process are revolutionised and with them
the economico-historical type of society. The other kinds of capital, which
appeared before industrial capital amid conditions of social production
that have receded into the past or are now succumbing, are not only subordinated
to it and the mechanism of their functions altered in conformity with it,
but move solely with it as their basis, hence live and die, stand and fall
with this basis. Money-capital and commodity-capital, so far as they function
as vehicles of particular branches of business, side by side with industrial
capital, are nothing but modes of existence of the different functional
forms now assumed, now discarded by industrial capital in the sphere of
circulation — modes which, due to social division of labour, have attained
independent existence and been developed one-sidedly.
The circuit M ... M' on the one hand intermingles with the general
circulation of commodities, proceeds from it and flows back into it, is
a part of it. On the other hand it forms an independent movement of the
capital-value for the individual capitalist, a movement of its own which
takes place partly within the general circulation of commodities, partly
outside of it, but which always preserves its independent character. First,
because its two phases that take place in the sphere of circulation, M — C
and C' — M', being phases of the movement of capital, have functionally
definite characters. In M — C, C is materially determined as labour-power
and means of production; in C' — M' the capital-value is realised plus
the surplus-value. Secondly, because P, the process of production, embraces
productive consumption. Thirdly, because the return of the money to its
starting-point makes of the movement M ... M' a circuit complete in itself.
Every individual capital is therefore, on the one hand, in its
two circulation-halves M — C and C' — M', an agent of the general circulation
of commodities, in which it either functions or lies concatenated as money
or as a commodity, thus forming a link in the general chain of metamorphoses
taking place in the world of commodities. On the other hand it describes
within the general circulation its own independent circuit in which the
sphere of production forms a transitional stage and in which this capital
returns to its starting-point in the same form in which it left that point.
Within its own circuit, which includes its real metamorphosis in the process
of production, it changes at the same time the magnitude of its value.
It returns not simply as money-value, but as augmented, increased money-value.
Let us finally consider M — C ... P ... C' — M' as a special form
of the circular course of capital, alongside the other forms which we shall
analyse later. We shall find that it is distinguished by the following
features:
1. It appears as the circuit of money-capital, because
industrial capital in its money-form, as money-capital, forms the
starting-point and the point of return of its total process. The formula
itself expresses the fact that the money is not expended here as money
but is merely advanced, hence is merely the money-form of capital, money-capital.
It expresses furthermore that exchange-value, not use-value, is the determining
aim of this movement. Just because the money-form of value is the independent,
tangible form in which value appears, the form of circulation M ... M',
the initial and terminal points of which are real money, expresses most
graphically the compelling motive of capitalist production — money-making.
The process of production appears merely as an unavoidable intermediate
link, as a necessary evil for the sake of money-making. All nations with
a capitalist mode of production are therefore seized periodically by a
feverish attempt to make money without the intervention of the process
of production.
2. The stage of production, the function of P, represents in this
circuit an interruption between the two phases of circulation M — C ...
C' — M', which in its turn represents only the intermediate link in the
simple circulation M — C — M'. The process of production appears in the
form of a circuit-describing process, formally and explicitly as that which
it is in the capitalist mode of production, as a mere means of expanding
the advanced value, hence enrichment as such as the purpose of production.
3. Since the series of phases is opened by M — C, the second link
of the circulation is C' — M'. In other words, the starting-point is M,
the money-capital that is to be self-expanded; the terminal point is M',
the self-expanded money-capital M plus m, in which M figures as realised
capital along with its offspring m. This distinguishes the circuit of M
from that of the two other circuits P and C', and does so in two ways.
On the one hand by the money-form of the two extremes. And money is the
independent, tangible form of existence of value, the value of the product
in its independent value-form, in which every trace of the use-value of
the commodities has been extinguished. On the other hand the form P ...
P does not necessarily become P ... P' (P plus p), and in the form C ...
C' no difference whatever in value is visible between the two extremes.
It is therefore characteristic of the formula M — M' that for one thing
capital-value is its starting-point and expanded capital-value its point
of return, so that the advance of capital-value appears as the means and
expanded capital-value as the end of the entire operation; and that for
another thing this relation is expressed in money-form, in the independent
value-form, hence money-capital as money begetting money. The generation
of surplus-value by value is not only expressed as the Alpha and Omega
of the process, but explicitly in the form of glittering money.
4. Since M', the money-capital realised as a result of C' — M',
the complementary and concluding phase of M — C, has absolutely the same
form as that in which it began its first circuit, it can, as soon as it
emerges from the latter, begin the same circuit over again as an increased
(accumulated) money-capital; M' = M + m. And at least it is not expressed
in the form M ... M' that, in the repetition of the circuit, the circulation
of m separates from that of M. Considered in its one-time form, formally,
the circuit of money-capital expresses therefore simply the process of
self-expansion and of accumulation. Consumption is expressed in it only
as productive consumption, 
by M — C<LMP, and
it is only this consumption that is included in this circuit of individual
capital. M — L is L — M or C — M on the part of the labourer. It is therefore the first phase of circulation which brings about his individual consumption,
thus: L — M — C (means of subsistence). The second phase M — C, no longer falls within the circuit of individual capital, but is initiated and premised
by it, since the labourer must above all live, hence maintain himself by
individual consumption, in order to always be in the market as material
that the capitalist can exploit. But this consumption itself is here only
assumed as a condition for the productive consumption of labour-power by
capital, hence only to the extent that the worker maintains and reproduces
himself as labour-power by means of his individual consumption. However
the MP, the commodities proper which enter into the circuit of capital,
are nutriment for the productive consumption only. The act L — M promotes
the individual consumption of the labourer, the transformation of the means
of subsistence into his flesh and blood. True, the capitalist must also
be there, must also live and consume to be able to perform the function
of a capitalist. To this end, he has, indeed, to consume only as much as
the labourer, and that is all this form of the circulation process presupposes.
But even this is not formally expressed, since the formula concludes with
M', i.e., a result which can at once resume its function as money-capital,
now augmented.
C' — M' directly contains the sale of C'; but C' — M', a sale
on the one part, is M — C, a purchase, on the other part, and in the last
analysis a commodity is bought only for its use-value, in order to enter
(leaving intermediate sales out of consideration) the process of consumption,
whether this is individual or productive, according to the nature of the
article bought. But this consumption does not enter the circuit of individual
capital, the product of which is C'. This product is eliminated from the
circuit precisely because it is a commodity for sale. C' is expressly designed
for consumption by others than the producer. Thus we find that certain
exponents of the mercantile system (which is based on the formula M — C
... P ... C' — M') deliver lengthy sermons to the effect that the individual
capitalist should consume only as much as the labourer, that the nation
of capitalists should leave the consumption of their own commodities, and
the consumption process in general, to the other, less intelligent nations
but that they themselves should make productive consumption their life’s
task. These sermons frequently remind one in form and content of analogous
ascetic expostulations of the fathers of the church.


Capital’s movement in circuits is therefore the unity of circulation
and production; it includes both. Since the two phases M — C and C' — M'
are acts of circulation, the circulation of capital is a part of the general
circulation of commodities. But as functionally they are definite sections,
stages in capital’s circuit, which pertains not only to the sphere of circulation
but also to that of production, capital goes through its own circuit in
the general circulation of commodities. The general circulation of commodities
serves capital in the first stage as a means of assuming that shape in
which it can perform the function of productive capital; in the second
stage it serves to strip off the commodity-function in which capital cannot
renew its circuit; at the same time it opens up to capital the possibility
of separating its own circuit from the circulation of the surplus-value
that accrued to it.
The circuit made by money-capital is therefore the most one-sided,
and thus the most striking and typical form in which the circuit of industrial
capital appears, the capital whose aim and compelling motive — the self-expansion
of value, the making of money, and accumulation — is thus conspicuously
revealed (buying to sell dearer). Owing to the fact that the first phase
is M — C it is also revealed that the constituents of productive capital
originate in the commodity-market, and in general that the capitalist process
of production depends on circulation, on commerce. The circuit of money-capital
is not merely the production of commodities; it is itself possible only
through circulation and presupposes it. This is plain, if only from the
fact that the form M belonging in circulation appears as the first and
pure form of advanced capital-value, which is not the case in the other
two circuit forms.
The money-capital circuit always remains the general expression
of industrial capital, because it always includes the self-expansion of
the advanced value. In P ... P, the money-expression of capital appears
only as the price of the elements of production, hence only as a value
expressed in money of account and is fixed in this form in book-keeping.
M ... M' becomes a special form of the industrial capital circuit
when newly active capital is first advanced in the form of money and then
withdrawn in the same form, either in passing from one branch of industry
to another or in retiring industrial capital from a business. This includes
the functioning as capital of the surplus-value first advanced in the form
of money, and becomes most evident when surplus-value functions in some
other business than the one in which it originated. M ... M' may be the
first circuit of a certain capital; it may be the last; it may be regarded
as the form of the total social capital; it is the form of capital that
is newly invested, either as capital recently accumulated in the form of
money, or as some old capital which is entirely transformed into money
for the purpose of transfer from one branch of industry to another.
Being a form always contained in all circuits, money-capital performs
this circuit precisely for that part of capital which produces surplus-value,
viz., variable capital. The normal form of advancing wages is payment in
money; this process must be renewed in comparatively short intervals, because
the labourer lives from hand to mouth. The capitalist must therefore always
confront the labourer as money-capitalist, and his capital as money-capital.
There can be no direct or indirect balancing of accounts in this case such
as we find in the purchase of means of production and in the sale of produced
commodities (so that the greater part of the money-capital actually figures
only in the form of commodities, money only in the form of money of account
and finally in cash only in the balancing of accounts). On the other hand,
a part of the surplus-value arising out of variable capital is spent by
the capitalist for his individual consumption, which pertains to the retail
trade and, however circuitous the route may be, this part is always spent
in cash, in the money-form of surplus-value. Variable capital always appears
anew as money-capital invested in wages (M — L) and m as surplus-value
to defray the cost of individual consumption of the capitalist. Hence M,
advanced variable capital-value, and m, its increment, are necessarily
held in the form of money to be spent in this form.
The formula M — C ... P ... C' — M', with its result M' = M +
m, is deceptive in form, is illusory in character, owing to the existence
of the advanced and self-expanded value in its equivalent form, money.
The emphasis is not on the self-expansion of value but on the money-form

of this process, on the fact that more value in money-form is finally drawn
out of the circulation than was originally advanced to it; hence on the
multiplication of the mass of gold and silver belonging to the capitalist.
The so-called monetary system is merely an expression of the irrational
form M — C — M', a movement which takes place exclusively in circulation
and therefore can explain the two acts M — C and C — M' in no other way
than as a sale of C above its value in the second act and therefore as
C drawing more money out of the circulation than was put into it by its
purchase. On the other hand M — C ... P ... C' — M', fixed as the exclusive
form, constitutes the basis of the more highly developed mercantile system,
in which not only the circulation of commodities but also their production
appears as a necessary element.
The illusory character of M — C ... P ... C' — M' and the correspondingly
illusory interpretation exists whenever this form is fixed as occurring
once, not as fluent and ever renewed; hence whenever this form is considered
not as one of the forms of the circuit but as its exclusive form. But it
itself points toward other forms.
In the first place this entire circuit is premised on the capitalist
character of the process of production, and therefore considers this process
together with the specific social conditions brought about by it as the
basis. M — C = M — C<LMP; but M — L assumes the existence of the wage-labourer, and hence the means of production as part of productive capital. It assumes therefore that the process of labour and self-expansion, the process of production, is a function of capital.
In the second place, if M ... M' is repeated, the return to the
money-form appears just as evanescent as the money-form in the first stage.
M — C disappears to make room for P. The constantly recurrent advance in
the form of money and its constant return in the form of money appear merely
as fleeting moments in the circuit.
In the third place



Beginning with the second repetition of the circuit, the circuit P ...
C' — M'. M — C ... P appears before the second circuit of M is completed,
and all subsequent circuits may thus be considered under the form of P
... C' — M — C ... P, so that M — C, being the first phase of the first
circuit, is merely the passing preparation for the constantly repeated
circuit of the productive capital. And this indeed is so in the case of
industrial capital invested for the first time in the form of money-capital.
On the other hand before the second circuit of P is completed,
the first circuit, that of commodity-capital, C' — M'.M — C ... P ... C'
(abridged C' ... C') has already been made. Thus the first form already
contains the other two, and the money-form thus disappears, so far as it
is not merely an expression of value but an expression of value in the
equivalent form, in money.
Finally, if we consider some newly invested individual capital
describing for the first time the circuit M — C ... P ... C' — M', then
M — C is the preparatory phase, the forerunner of the first process of
production gone through by this individual capital. This phase M — C is
consequently not presupposed but rather called for or necessitated by the
process of production. But this applies only to this individual capital.
The general form of the circuit of industrial capital is the circuit
of money-capital, whenever the capitalist mode of production is taken
for granted, hence in social conditions determined by capitalist production.
Therefore the capitalist process of production is assumed as a pre-condition,
if not in the first circuit of the money-capital of a newly invested industrial
capital, then outside of it. The continuous existence of this process of
production presupposes the constantly renewed circuit P ... P. Even in
the first stage, M — C, this premise plays a part, for this assumes on the one hand the existence of the class of wage-labourers; and then, on the other, that which is M — C, the first
stage, for the buyer of means of production, is C' — M' for their seller;
hence C' presupposes commodity-capital, and thus the commodities themselves
as a result of capitalist production, and thereby the function of productive
capital.

5. This is true no matter how we separate capital-value and surplus-value. 10,000 lbs. of yarn contain 1,560 lbs., or £78 worth of surplus-value; likewise, one lb., or one shilling’s worth of yarn, contains 2.496 ounces, or 1.872 pence worth, of surplus-value.
