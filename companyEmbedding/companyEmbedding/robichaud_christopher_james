BOS Brands: challenges of internationalisation

            Human, Christopher James; Bick, Geoff
        

            Subject areaThis teaching case focuses on the field of marketing, particularly, the situation of building a global brand as small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) internationalizing from an emerging market.Study level/applicabilityIt is recommended for postgraduate and post-experience students, for example, in MBA programmes and executive education courses.Case overviewThis teaching case focuses on the field of marketing, particularly, the situation of building a global brand as SME internationalizing from an emerging market. It is recommended for postgraduate and post-experience students, for example, in MBA programmes and executive education courses. BOS Brands provides an interesting case on the internationalisation experience of a Born Global firm, particularly from an emerging market context. This medium-sized South African business develops, distributes and markets Rooibos-based beverages in Southern Africa and Europe, with eyes on a broader global presence. The case provides insights into the strategic decisions required to successfully take a medium-sized business into competitive foreign markets without the capital and support enjoyed by many larger multinational corporations. Among other issues, BOS Brands provides fertile ground to explore the selection of target country and entry mode, overcoming cultural and physical distance, opportunity recognition and the roles of networks and innovation.Expected learning outcomesThe expected learning outcomes are to: analyse the decision-making process of the internationalising SME in terms of internationalisation factors, timing and phases and evaluation of potential target countries and entry mode options and launch marketing approach; understand the complexities of marketing in a foreign cultural and business context (including cultural and physical distance); and develop alternative marketing strategies for an entrepreneurial SME to grow internationally given limited resources.Supplementary materialsTeaching notes are available for educators only.

BOS Brands: challengesof internationalisationChristopher James Human and Geoff BickChristopher James Humanis Professor of Marketing,and Geoff Bick isProfessor of Marketingand Academic Director,both at the GraduateSchool of Business,University of Cape Town,Cape Town, South Africa.[. . .] from: Rick Greene Ͻrichard.greene@.comϾ[. . .] to: Dave Ͻdave@bosbrands.comϾ[. . .] date: Wed, November 22, 2015 at 10:13 p.m.[. . .] subject: Listing OpportunityHi Dave – Anne and I ﬁnally had the chance to meet yesterday afternoon, crossing paths atO’Hare for all of 45 minutes. We are excited by the prospect of getting BOS on our shelves intime for summer 2016, and I think we could push for a nationwide rollout. Your product is fresh,and it’s doing well in Europe, which is a good indicator for our developed market. Simon M andhis category team would need to head across to South Africa and to your bottling partners inEurope with one of our planners, take a look at your operations and conduct a capacity auditand - of course - we still need to run projections. But we expect to be able to move volumessomewhere around 4 million units in the ﬁrst year, based on a 5-year exclusivity agreement(which is standard for all our new foreign listings). Last time we spoke, you stated that you werehesitant to take your eye off the ball in SA and Europe, but I would suggest coming across todiscuss. I think we have the market and reach to build a compelling case for BOS’s entry intothe USA. I can also set up some meetings with contract bottlers and a few of our packagingguys stateside. Let’s talk. Regards, Rick1. IntroductionResting on the marble counter in the Slow Lounge, in the International Departures Terminalof Johannesburg’s OR Tambo Airport, Dave’s inbox stares back at him. As always, it offersfewer answers than questions. BOS Brand’s youthful Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) is nostranger to tough decisions, but he has never grown accustomed to turning downgame-changers like this. He had ﬁrst met Rick by chance, at a low-key year-end functionhosted by the Swiss company that had helped develop the ﬂavours for BOS’s new naturalenergy drink. The USA is not on BOS’s radar just yet, but this is a major opportunity with oneof the world’s most powerful retailers. It is also in the planet’s largest ice-tea market –consuming close to 7 billion litres[1] of ice tea a year and expanding at close to 5 per centa year (compound annual growth rate in value)[2].Since joining the founding team of South Africa’s fastest growing soft drink company inFebruary 2011, Dave has watched BOS’s share of its home ice tea market grow from under1 per cent to close to 15 per cent. With this growth has come renewed global interest in theirunique Rooibos-based product lines, which now include energy and sports drinks.Perhaps, he would need to get used to the fear of missing out, but he also could not helpwondering if now was the wrong time to be conservative. Does it make sense to stick to theThe authors thank DaveEvans, CEO of BOS Brands,and his management team forthe information and insightsinto the company.Disclaimer.

Big business stability and economic growth: Is what's good for General Motors good for America?

            Fogel, Kathy; Morck, Randall; Yeung, Bernard
        

            What is good for a country may not be good for its big businesses, at least recently. More turnover in top businesses correlates with faster per capita gross domestic product, productivity, and capital growth; supporting Schumpeter's (1942. Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, third ed., Harper & Bros., New York, NY) theory of “creative destruction”—innovative firms blooming as stagnant ones wither. These correlations are greater in more developed economies, supporting Aghion and Howitt's (1992. A model of growth through creative destruction. Econometrica 60, 323–351) thesis that creative destruction matters more to economies nearer the technological frontier. More big business turnover also correlates with smaller government, common law, less bank-dependence, stronger shareholder rights, and greater openness.
