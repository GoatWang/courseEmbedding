Brackett D.M.D., LLCparkerchris rated"Compassionate" is what I would first say about this dentist. He goes out of his way to avoid inflicting pain and is sincerely apologetic when it cannot be avoided - which is often the case with periodontal exams. He is courteous and friendly without being over-bearing. I felt comfortable with him - he treated me like a person, not just a patient. His staff is great too! You will feel cared for at this dental office!Hannaford Supermarket &#38; Phrmcy Corporate OfficeRachel M. ratedThey have always had WONDERFUL customer service but now I have a question about returns. I have never had a problem with returns but today I am wondering if it was right for me to return produce. It was pointed out to me that returning seeded grapes (my error) for seedless was wrong because you could not put them back in the produce section. I think it might be wrong, too. I would like to know how the store honestly views it.Nathan Goff DMDNathan G. ratedWe are a great office; call us or come check us out, you won't be disappointed that you did!  We are also on the web at www.nathangoffdmd.comDid You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Putting a New  Label on Avery Dennison



CEO Dean Scarborough is pushing an ambitious plan to transform the company from a materials supplier to a brand builder and provider of information services.

"What is our role in the world?"  That was the question Dean Scarborough began asking himself when he became CEO of Avery Dennison Corp. five years ago. Known best to consumers for its office products, the company's two largest businesses are as a supplier of pressure-sensitive materials and a provider of retail information products, which includes fabric labels and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. The company's individual businesses had clear strategies and knew their customers well, but employees had a difficult time connecting to what Avery Dennison's overall strategy was. So he struggled with finding a unifying vision around which the company's employees could marshal their efforts. That's not an insignificant issue in a company with 30,000 employees operating in 60 countries. Avery Dennison, No. 138 on the IW U.S. 500, had sales of $6 billion in 2009. In developing this vision statement, Scarborough had the advantage of knowing the company intimately. He joined Avery Dennison in 1983 and rose steadily through the ranks, becoming vice president and general manager of Fasson Roll North America in 1990 and then moving to the Netherlands in 1995 to lead Roll Materials Europe. Two years later, he returned to the United States to assume group vice president duties and then became president and chief operating officer in 2000. Scarborough was first attracted to Avery because of a culture that encouraged initiative and was supportive of new ideas. But 22 years later when he assumed the reins of the company, he was faced with an old nemesis of many CEOs -- a stock price in the doldrums. He began taking a series of steps to fuel growth and improve operational efficiency. He also set out to shift the company's focus so that it was "more external." Out of that work and more than a year of thought, Scarborough finally landed on a compelling vision. Rather than focus on what the company was making, he centered the message on how the company was adding value for customers -- helping them sell their products through packaging solutions that enhance their brands and through technologies such as RFID tags that provide enhanced intelligence to manufacturers and retailers.  In a May 20 speech at the Pathway to Manufacturing Prosperity conference sponsored by the Italian Trade Commission and                               IndustryWeek, Scarborough said Avery Dennison is "transforming ourselves from a manufacturer of basic materials into something more -- a trusted partner who makes every brand more inspiring and the world more intelligent. That is our new vision."                                External Focus                               To achieve growth, Scarborough knew when he became CEO in 2005 that he would have to shake up Avery Dennison's product mix. "I felt we did not have enough earnings growth in the existing portfolio," he recalls. "Office products was a declining business, which had great cash flow but there was a way for us to create shareholder value by creating a new business model with retail information services."  That meant pursuing RFID technology and its promise for bringing a new dimension to product tracking and retail information. "The emergence of a chip that costs a dime and allows you to get intelligence on a product and track it in multiple locations is an incredibly powerful concept," said Scarborough about RFID. "It is going to enable a lot of industries to drive to a level of efficiency that they have never thought possible before. This is not just item-level tracking for retail or getting baggage to move on airlines." As an example, he cites research the company is doing on tracking food spoilage without employing destructive testing. "There is all kinds of work going on now at a kind of micro level on how to track things much differently than before. That is what we mean by making the world more intelligent." In 2007, the company completed its acquisition of Paxar Corp. for $1.34 billion, a move intended to bolster Avery Dennison's RFID technology offering, provide a bigger footprint in emerging markets and enhance its market profile in Europe.  Scarborough sought to enhance Avery Dennison's understanding of the markets it serves by hiring managers who had experience in those industries. "We knew we needed to bring in marketing capabilities," Scarborough explains. Scarborough reasoned that these new managers could be taught about Avery Dennison quickly, and then their fresh perspective and intimate knowledge of their assigned industries would help drive innovation.  A central part of Scarborough's plan to grow the company has been an intensified focus on its external customers. "That's the change I am really trying to drive. By external I don't mean our direct customers. The label printer is our direct customer. We have got to get to the end users because that is where the real innovation can occur." Scarborough says the drive has been to get employees talking with customers, understanding their needs and then bringing them solutions. As an example of this new approach to the market, Scarborough cited the Roll Materials team's work with wine and spirits customers. "People who buy wine are purchasing more than a pleasant liquid -- they are acquiring a lifestyle, and the label is where that lifestyle can be expressed," he said. "Our segment marketers created an elegant wine label catalogue for vintners that positions wine as a luxury product and our labels as the symbol of that luxury." In the case of Mot et Chandon, Avery Dennison produced a "cravate" from pressure-sensitive labelstock and adhesives that keeps the foil securely around the curved bottleneck but does so without any wrinkles. Recession Moves  Avery Dennison's plant in Queretaro, Mexico, saw dramatic service and financial improvements after implementing the company's Enterprise Lean Sigma process.But even the best plans are subject to upset when the global economy takes a massive blow. "The recession hit us when consumers stopped shopping, retailers destocked and slashed inventories, and white collar businesses stopped buying office supplies," Scarborough told the Italian Trade Commission audience. "And the bottom fell out of the housing, automotive and advertising industries, which are all significant markets for us." As a result, sales fell $750 million from 2008 to 2009, the company recorded a $746 million loss and cut its dividend in half.                               Of course, all this came on the heels of the Paxar acquisition. "My timing couldn't have been worse. I bought at the top of the market, right before the worst retail recession in years," Scarborough admits, conceding that it has contributed to investor skepticism.  As the recession took hold, Avery Dennison quickly moved to minimize the economic impact. In late 2008, it started a restructuring that will generate $180 million in ongoing fixed cost reductions. The company also had its businesses concentrate on maximizing free cash flow. Notes Scarborough, "They overdelivered -- we grew free cash flow $100 million over 2008 to a record $465 million. As a result, we were able to reduce debt, protect our credit ratings and preserve our financial flexibility." During this period, Avery Dennison also was extending its Enterprise Lean Sigma (ELS) process throughout its operations. Scarborough explained that ELS had its roots in the company's office products business, where it had been instrumental in reducing direct labor costs 56% and the cost of goods sold by more than $170 million. In the Roll Materials business, ELS helped reduce inventory levels in 2009 by $65 million, a 24% improvement over the previous year, and led to a 20% increase in inventory turns. Scarborough said the word "enterprise" in the program emphasized to employees the "need to take a comprehensive view of the entire value stream to identify what"s truly valuable and what's not." He added that the key element of ELS was "the fact that the customer defines value and not us. The implication is that ELS is not a cost-reduction program. It's a value-creation system -- a tool for growth." Scarborough told the Italian Trade Commission audience that ELS is providing Avery Dennison with three main benefits: An improvement in the basic elements of service -- reliability, timeliness and flexibility. For example, Avery's plant in Queretaro, Mexico, that prints and manufactures labels deployed ELS and doubled the efficiency of its core production facilities while cutting order lead times in half. That boosted service levels above 90% and convinced the plant"s largest customer to stay and increase business. Stimulating innovation by focusing on solving customers" problems. Retail Information Systems India, Scarborough notes, contributed to growth by creating a new heat transfer process that does multicolor work in less time and with less cost. An improvement in productivity, which increases gross margins and generates funds for growth investments.  While Scarborough is convinced the company is making the right moves to ensure long-term growth, he admits that the results have not yet produced the anticipated shareholder value. In betting on innovation, technology and a solutions-focused customer approach to help the company grow, Scarborough puts that growth in context. "We are not trying to be a high-growth company, but I think we can grow at higher rates than we have in the past," he says. I didn"t think we had the portfolio to be able to do that a few years ago. I think we have that now."
