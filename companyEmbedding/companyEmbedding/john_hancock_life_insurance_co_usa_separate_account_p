Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

GUIDE TO THIS PROSPECTUS

This is the prospectus - it is not the contract. The prospectus simplifies many 
contract provisions to better communicate the contract's essential features.    
Your rights and obligations under the contract will be determined by the        
language of the contract itself. On request, we will provide the form of        
contract for you to review. In any event, when you receive your contract, we    
suggest you read it promptly.                                                   

This prospectus contains information that you should know before you buy a      
contract or exercise any of your rights under the contract.                     

The variable investment options shown above are those available as of the date  
of this prospectus. We may add, modify or delete variable investment options in 
the future.                                                                     

When you select one or more of these variable investment options, we invest your
money in NAV shares of a corresponding portfolio of the John Hancock Trust (the 
"Series Fund"). In this prospectus, the portfolios of the Series Fund are       
referred to as funds.                                                           

The Series Fund is a so-called "series" type mutual fund registered with the    
SEC. The investment results of each variable investment option you select will  
depend on those of the corresponding fund of one of the Series Funds. Each of   
the Funds is separately managed and has its own investment objective and        
strategies. Linked to the end of this prospectus is a prospectus for the Series 
Fund. The Series Fund's prospectuses contain detailed information about each    
available Fund. Be sure to read those prospectuses before selecting any of the  
variable investment options shown above.                                        

The contracts are not available in all states. This prospectus does not         
constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in
any state to any person to whom it is unlawful to make or solicit an offer in   
that state.

+ Commencement of operations -- May 3, 2004                                     

(A) Based on estimates for the current fiscal year                              

(C) The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its advisory fee   
for the Science & Technology Trust, Health Sciences Trust, the Blue Chip Growth 
Trust and the Equity-Income Trust. The waiver is based on the combined assets of
these portfolios and the Small Company Value Trust. Once these combined assets  
exceed specified amounts, the fee reduction is increased.                       

The fee reductions are applied to the advisory fees of each of the four         
portfolios. This voluntary fee waiver may be terminated at any time by the      
Adviser. If such advisory fee waiver were reflected, it is estimated that the   
"Management Fees" and "Total Annual Expenses" for these portfolios would have   
been as follows:                                                                

                                                                [Download Table]

Health Sciences Trust          1.02%          1.38%   
Blue Chip Growth Trust         0.79%          1.08%   
Equity-Income Trust            0.79%          1.09%   

(D) For certain portfolios, the Adviser reduces its advisory fee or reimburses  
the portfolio if the total of all expenses (excluding advisory fees, Rule 12b-1 
fees, transfer agency fees, blue sky fees, taxes, portfolio brokerage           
commissions, interest, litigation and indemnification expenses and other        
extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the portfolio's   
business) exceed certain annual rates. In the case of the Small Company Trust,  
U.S. Global Leaders Growth Trust, and Classic Value Trust, the Adviser          
reimbursed the portfolio for certain expenses for the year ended December 31,
2004. If such expense reimbursement were reflected, it is estimated that "Other 
Expenses" and "Total Annual Expenses" would be:                                 

                                                                [Download Table]

Classic Value Trust                    0.50%        1.62%  

These voluntary expense reimbursements may be terminated at any time.           

(E) Effective December 9, 2003, due to a decrease in the subadvisory fees for   
the Global Trust and the International Value Trust, the Adviser voluntarily     
agreed to waive its advisory fees so that the amount retained by the Adviser    
after payment of the subadvisory fees for each such portfolio does not exceed   
0.35% of the portfolio's average net assets. For the year ended December 31,
2004, the effective annual advisory fees ("Management Fees") and "Total Annual  
Expenses" were as follows:                                                      

                                                                [Download Table]

These advisory fee waivers may be rescinded at any time.                        

(F) Financial Services and Fundamental Value Trusts. The Adviser has voluntarily
agreed to reduce its advisory fee for the Financial Services and Fundamental    
Value Trusts to the amounts shown below. These advisory fee waivers may be      
terminated at any time.

fees ("Management Fees") and "Total Annual Expenses" for these portfolios would 
have been as follows:

EXAMPLES 

The following examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in
an eVariable Annuity contract with the cost of investing in other variable      
annuity contracts. These costs include contract fees, separate account annual   
expenses and fund fees and expenses. The first example assumes that you invest  
$10,000 in an eVariable Annuity contract , that your investment has a 5% return 
each year and assumes deductions for the annual contact fee and the maximum fees
and expenses of any of the funds. Although your actual costs may be higher or   
lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:

(3) IF YOU DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR CONTRACT   $264    $811   $1,385  $2,944 

The next example assumes that you invest $10,000 in an eVariable Annuity        
contract for the time periods indicated. This example also assumes that your    
investment has a 5% return each year and assumes the annual contract fee we     
expect to receive for the contracts and the minimum fees and expenses of any of 
the funds.                                                                      

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions,  
your costs would be:

BASIC INFORMATION 
WHAT IS THE CONTRACT?                                                           

The contract is a deferred payment variable annuity contract. An "annuity       
contract" provides a person (known as the "annuitant" or "payee") with a series 
of periodic payments. Because this contract is also a "deferred payment"        
contract, the annuity payments will begin on a future date, called the          
contract's "date of maturity." Under a "variable annuity" contract, the amount  
you have invested can increase or decrease in value daily based upon the value  
of the variable investment options chosen.

P-->485APOS8th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 8th
We measure the years and anniversaries of your contract from its date of issue. 
We use the term contract year to refer to each period of time between           
anniversaries of your contract's date of issue.                                 

WHO OWNS THE CONTRACT?                                                          

That's up to you. Unless the contract provides otherwise, the owner of the      
contract is the person who can exercise the rights under the contract, such as  
the right to choose the investment options or the right to surrender the        
contract. In many cases, the person buying the contract will be the owner.      
However, you are free to name another person or entity (such as a trust) as     
owner. In writing this prospectus, we've assumed that you, the reader, are the  
person or persons entitled to exercise the rights and obligations under         
discussion.                                                                     

IS THE OWNER ALSO THE ANNUITANT?                                                

In many cases, the same person is both the annuitant and the owner of a         
contract. The annuitant is the person whose lifetime is used to measure the     
period of time when we make various forms of annuity payments. Also, the        
annuitant receives payments from us under any annuity option that commences     
during the annuitant's lifetime. We may permit you to name another person as    
annuitant or joint annuitant if that person meets our underwriting standards. We
may also permit you to name as joint annuitants two persons other than yourself 
if those persons meet our underwriting standards.                               

HOW CAN I INVEST MONEY IN A CONTRACT?                                           

PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

We call the investments you make in your contract premiums or premium payments. 
In general, you need at least a $5,000 initial premium payment to purchase a    
contract. However, you need only $2,000 to open an individual retirement account
or $1,000 to begin the annuity direct deposit program. If you choose to         
contribute more money into your contract, each subsequent premium payment must  
be at least $100, except that you may make subsequent premium payments for as   
low as $50 if you are participating in our annuity direct deposit program.      

APPLYING FOR A CONTRACT 

You can purchase a contract by (1) completing an application for a contract and 
(2) transmitting it, along with your initial premium payment, to the            
Administrative Servicing Office shown on the Cover Pages.                       

Once we receive your initial premium payment and all necessary information, we  
will issue your contract and invest your initial premium payment within two     
business days. If the information is not in good order, we will contact you to  
get the necessary information. If for some reason, we are unable to complete    
this process within 5 business days, we will either send back your money or get 
your permission to keep it until we get all of the necessary information.       

We will not issue a contract if the proposed annuitant is age 85 or older.      

LIMITS ON PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

You can make premium payments of up to $1,000,000 in any one contract year.     
Under our current administrative rules, the total of all new premium payments   
that you may allocate into any one variable investment option may not exceed    
$500,000, less any amount you previously transferred into that variable         
investment option during that year. While the annuitant is alive and the        
contract is in force, you can make premium payments at any time before the      
annuitant's 85th birthday. We may waive either of these limits, however.        

We may also impose limits on the amount of premium payments that you can        
allocate to any one variable investment option in any one contract year, but we 
currently do not do so.                                                         

WAYS TO MAKE PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

Premium payments made by check or money order should be:                        

-     drawn on a U.S. bank,                                         

-     drawn in U.S. dollars, and                                    

-     made payable to "John Hancock."                               

We will not accept credit card checks. Nor will we accept starter or third party
checks that fail to meet our administrative requirements.                       

Premium payments should be sent to the Administrative Servicing Office. We will 
accept your initial premium payment by exchange from another insurance company. 
In addition you can make payments automatically from your checking account via  
the annuity direct

deposit program. You can find information about methods of premium payment by   
contacting the Electronic Servicing Center or by writing to our Administrative  
Servicing Office.                                                               

Once we have issued your contract and it becomes effective, we credit you with  
any additional premiums you pay as of the day we receive them at the            
Administrative Servicing Office. From each premium payment you make, we deduct  
the charges described under "Deductions from premium payments" below. We invest 
the rest in the variable investment options you've elected. Special investment  
rules apply to premiums received during the right to cancel period. (See        
Question 14. "Can I return my contract?")                                       

WHAT IS THE ELECTRONIC SERVICING CENTER?                                        

We maintain an Electronic Servicing Center specifically for this contract to    
provide variable annuity contract information and other information to current  
and prospective owners, and to permit various transactions to be performed      
electronically. The Electronic Servicing Center also contains detailed          
instructions on how to initiate transactions, such as transferring value among  
variable investment options, changing the annuitant, beneficiary or owner,      
withdrawing value from a contract, changing the date of maturity or annuity     
option, and reporting a death claim. These instructions must be followed and may
contain a requirement for you to fax or mail a document with your signature to  
our Administrative Servicing Office or to a different address. Electronic       
requests for transactions that require a signature will not be processed.       

For security, you will select a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or password
to access information through the Electronic Servicing Center. You are          
responsible for any use of this PIN or password.                                

The current Universal Resource Locator (or "URL") for the Electronic Service    
Center is http://www.AnnuityNet.com. The current address for our Administrative 
Servicing Office is shown on the Cover Pages. If we should change the Electronic
Servicing Center or our Administrative Servicing Office, we will notify you in  
writing or by transmitting an e-mail message to your last known e-mail address. 

If you agree, our Electronic Servicing Center will deliver all notices,         
documents, and other information relating to your policy to your e-mail address 
or, in some cases, to your personal account folder located at the Electronic    
Servicing Center, until you revoke this consent. Examples of the electronic     
documents we will deliver include: the contract, prospectuses, transaction      
confirmation statements and other information. We reserve the right, however, to
deliver documents to you on paper at any time should the need arise.            

To view, download, or print electronic documents, you must have access to the   
Internet, maintain a valid e-mail address, and install ADOBE ACROBAT READER on  
your computer.                                                                  

We do not currently charge a fee for providing electronic documents; however,   
you may incur Internet access charges, telephone charges, and other third party 
charges when receiving electronic documents or downloading required software.   
YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OR TRANSACT BUSINESS ON THE ELECTRONIC SERVICING CENTER  
MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS SYSTEM OUTAGES. 

You may revoke your consent to further delivery of electronic documents at any  
time by writing to our Administrative Servicing Office.                         

You may obtain a paper copy of documents relating to your contract by writing to
our Administrative Servicing Office. Please indicate which documents you want to
receive on paper and provide us with your mailing address. We may charge a fee  
for producing paper copies of documents that have been delivered to you         
electronically.                                                                 

You may update your e-mail address by contacting the Electronic Servicing       
Center.                                                                         

We permit certain transactions to be initiated through the Electronic Servicing 
Center, subject to the following conditions:                                    

  -     We will not process e-mailed requests for transactions under the
contract for which we require a signature.              

     -     We and our agents can act on all instructions received with respect
         to your application and your contract when your password is used.
            Our sole responsibility is to execute the instructions received. All
        instructions using your personal account number and password are
deemed sent by you.                                     

   -     We and our agents are only responsible for executing instructions
            that are received and acknowledged by the Electronic Service Center.
         We will notify you by transmitting an e-mail message to your last
known e-mail address.                                   

      -     You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You must
notify us and our agents of:                            

    -     Any loss or theft of your password and/or personal account number;
or                                                      

-     Any unauthorized use of your password or personal account     
information; or                                         

-     Any failure by you to receive a message that an order entered 
          through the website order system has been received and/or executed
through the order system; or                            

9 

P-->485APOS10th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 10th
   -     Any failure by you to receive accurate written confirmation of an
         order or its execution within (3) business days after placing the
order through the website order system.                 

HOW WILL THE VALUE OF MY INVESTMENT IN THE CONTRACT CHANGE OVER TIME?           

Prior to a contract's date of maturity, the amount you've invested in any       
variable investment option will increase or decrease based upon the investment  
experience of the corresponding fund. Except for certain charges we deduct, and 
except for the special procedures we follow during the right to cancel period,  
your investment experience will be the same as if you had invested in the fund  
directly and reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional      
shares. We describe our special procedures during the right to cancel period in 
the Allocation of premium payments section under Question 10.                   

Like a regular mutual fund, each fund deducts investment management fees and    
other operating expenses. These expenses are shown in the Fee Tables section of 
this prospectus. However, unlike a mutual fund, we will also deduct charges     
relating to the annuity guarantees and other features provided by the contract. 
These charges reduce your investment performance and the amount we have credited
to your contract in any variable investment option. We describe these charges   
under Question 11. "What fees and charges will be deducted from my contract?"   

At any time before the date of maturity, the total value of your contract equals

-     the total amount you invested,                                

-     minus all charges we deduct,                                  

-     minus all withdrawals you have made, and                      

      -     plus or minus each variable investment option's positive or negative
        investment return that we credit daily to any of your contract's
value daily while it is in that option.                 

WHAT ANNUITY BENEFITS DOES A CONTRACT PROVIDE?                                  

If your contract is still in effect on its date of maturity, it enters the      
annuity period. During the annuity period, we make a series of variable payments
to you as provided under one of our several annuity options. The form in which  
we will make the annuity payments, and the proportion of such payments that will
be on a variable basis, depend on the elections that you have in effect on the  
date of maturity. Therefore you should exercise care in selecting your date of  
maturity and your choices that are in effect on that date.                      

You should carefully review section AI-5 "The annuity period" in the Additional 
Information portion of this prospectus, for information about all of these      
choices you can make.                                                           

TO WHAT EXTENT CAN WE VARY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACTS?           

STATE LAW INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS 

Insurance laws and regulations apply to us in every state in which our contracts
are sold. As a result, various terms and conditions of your contract may vary   
from the terms and conditions described in this prospectus, depending upon where
you reside. These variations will be reflected in your contract or in           
endorsements attached to your contract.                                         

VARIATIONS IN CHARGES OR RATES 

We may vary the charges, guarantee periods, and other terms of our contracts    
where special circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses,         
mortality risks or other risks that are different from those normally associated
with the contracts. These include the types of variations discussed under       
"Certain changes" in the Additional Information section of this prospectus.     

WHAT ARE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF OWNING A CONTRACT?                             

In most cases, no income tax will have to be paid on amounts you earn under a   
contract until these earnings are paid out. All or part of the following        
distributions from a contract may constitute a taxable payout of earnings:      

-     partial withdrawal (including systematic withdrawals),        

-     full withdrawal ("surrender"),                                

-     payment of any death benefit proceeds, and                    

-     periodic payments under one of our annuity payment options.   

How much you will be taxed on distribution is based upon complex tax rules and  
depends on matters such as:                                                     

-     the type of the distribution,                                 

10

P-->485APOS11th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 11th
-     when the distribution is made, and                            

-     the circumstances under which the payments are made.          

If your contract is issued in connection with a traditional individual          
retirement annuity plan, all or part of your premium payments may be            
tax-deductible.                                                                 

Special 10% tax penalties apply in many cases to the taxable portion of any     
distributions from a contract before you reach age 59 1/2. Also, some retirement
plans require that distributions from a contract commence and/or be completed by
a certain period of time. This effectively limits the period of time during     
which you can continue to derive tax deferral benefits from any tax-deductible  
premiums you paid or on any earnings under the contract.                        

THE FAVORABLE TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE FOR ANNUITY CONTRACTS ISSUED IN CONNECTION 
WITH AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY PLAN OR OTHER TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT    
PLAN, ARE ALSO GENERALLY AVAILABLE FOR OTHER TYPES OF INVESTMENTS OF            
TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS, SUCH AS INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL FUNDS, EQUITIES AND DEBT     
INSTRUMENTS. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER THE EXPENSES UNDER AN ANNUITY
CONTRACT ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN, AND THE INVESTMENT     
OPTIONS, DEATH BENEFITS AND LIFETIME ANNUITY INCOME OPTIONS PROVIDED UNDER SUCH 
AN ANNUITY CONTRACT, ARE SUITABLE FOR YOUR NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES.                
HOW CAN I CHANGE MY CONTRACT'S INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS?                          

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS 

When you apply for your contract, you specify the variable investment options in
which your premium payments will be allocated. You may change this investment   
allocation for future premium payments at any time by sending us acceptable     
notice through our Electronic Servicing Center or by writing to our             
Administrative Servicing Office. Any change in allocation will be effective as  
of our receipt of your request. All percentages that you select must be in whole
numbers.                                                                        

Premium payments received prior to the expiration of the right to cancel period 
will automatically be allocated to the Money Market variable investment option. 
The portion of the Money Market variable investment option attributable to such 
payments will be reallocated automatically among the variable investment options
you have chosen upon the expiration of the right to cancel period. Premium      
payments received after the expiration of the right to cancel period will be    
allocated among the variable investment options you have chosen as soon as they 
are processed. We describe the right to cancel period following "Can I return my
contract?"                                                                      

Currently, we do not impose a limit on the number of variable investment options
that you may use at any one time or over the life of your contract, although we 
reserve the right to do so in the future.                                       

TRANSFERRING YOUR ASSETS 

You may transfer all or part of the assets held in one investment option to any 
other investment option subject to the restrictions set forth below.            

To make a transfer, you must tell us how much to transfer, either as a whole    
number percentage or as a specific dollar amount. A confirmation of each        
transfer will be sent to you. Without our approval, the maximum amount you may  
transfer to or from any investment option in any contract year is $500,000.     

Currently, we do not impose a charge for transfer requests. The first twelve    
transfers in a contract year are free of any transfer charge. For each          
additional transfer in a contract year, we do not currently assess a charge but 
reserve the right (to the extent permitted by your contract) to impose a charge 
of up to $25 for any transfer beyond the annual limit.                          

We have adopted policies and procedures to restrict frequent transfers of       
contract value among variable investment options. Variable investment options in
variable annuity and variable life insurance products can be a prime target for 
abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment
options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options  
without immediate tax consequences. As a result, some investors may seek to     
frequently transfer into and out of investment options in reaction to market    
news or to exploit some perceived pricing inefficiency. Whatever the reason,    
long-term investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent   
transfer activity since such activity may expose a Fund to increased portfolio  
transaction costs and/or disruption to the Fund manager's ability to effectively
manage a Fund's investment portfolio in accordance with the Fund's investment   
objective and policies, both of which may result in dilution with respect to    
interests held for long-term investment.                                        

To discourage disruptive frequent trading activity, we have adopted a policy for
the Account to restrict transfers to two per calendar month per contract, with  
certain exceptions, and procedures to count the number of transfers made under a
contract. Under the current procedures of the Account, we count all transfers   
made during the period from the opening of trading each day the net asset value 
of the shares of a Fund are determined (usually 9 a.m.) to the close of trading 
that day (the close of day-time trading of the New York Stock Exchange - usually
4 p.m.) as a single transfer. We do not count: (a) scheduled transfers made     
pursuant to our Dollar Cost Averaging program or our Strategic Rebalancing      
Program, (b) transfers from any fixed account option available under your       
contract at

the end of its guarantee period, (c) transfers made within a prescribed period  
before and after a substitution of underlying Funds and (d) transfers made      
during the annuity period (these transfers are subject to a 30 day notice       
requirement, however, as described below). Under the Account's policy and       
procedures, Contract owners may transfer to a Money Market investment option    
even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached if 100% of the        
contract value in all variable investment options is transferred to that Money  
Market investment option. If such a transfer to a Money Market investment option
is made, for a 30 calendar day period after such transfer, no subsequent        
transfers from that Money Market investment option to another variable          
investment option may be made. We apply the Account's policy and procedures     
uniformly to all contract owners.                                               

We reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading,     
including, but not limited to:                                                  

   -     restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period,

-     restricting the dollar amount of transfers,                   

 -     restricting the method used to submit transfers (e.g., changing
            procedures to require that transfer requests be submitted in writing
via U.S. mail), and                                     

-     restricting transfers into and out of certain subaccounts.    

In addition, we reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable 
to purchase or redeem shares of the Funds. We also reserve the right to modify  
or terminate the transfer privilege at any time (to the extent permitted by     
applicable law), and to prohibit a transfer less than 30 days prior to the      
contract's date of maturity.                                                    

While we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity, it  
may not always be possible to do so. Therefore, no assurance can be given that  
the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing disruptive frequent 
trading activity and avoiding harm to long-term investors.                      

DURING THE ANNUITY PERIOD, YOU MAY NOT MAKE ANY TRANSFER THAT WOULD RESULT IN   
MORE THAN FOUR INVESTMENT OPTIONS BEING USED AT ONCE. You must submit your      
transfer request to our Administrative Service Center at least 30 days before   
the due date of the first annuity payment to which your transfer will apply.    

Procedure for transferring your assets                                          

You may request a transfer of contract value among variable investment options  
by sending us acceptable notice through our Electronic Servicing Center or by   
writing to our Administrative Serving Office. Your request should include:      

-     your name,                                                    

-     daytime telephone number,                                     

-     contract number,                                              

   -     the names of the variable investment options being transferred to
and from each, and                                      

-     the amount of each transfer.                                  

The request becomes effective on the day we receive your request in proper form.

WHAT FEES AND CHARGES WILL BE DEDUCTED FROM MY CONTRACT? 

ASSET-BASED CHARGE 

We deduct the daily asset-based charge shown in the Fee Tables to compensate us 
primarily for our administrative expenses and the mortality and expense risks   
that we assume under the contract.                                              

In return for the charge, we assume the risk that annuitants as a class will    
live longer than expected, requiring us to a pay greater number of annuity      
payments. We also assume the risk that our expenses relating to the contracts   
may be higher than we expected when we set the level of the contracts' other    
fees and charges, or that our revenues from such other sources will be less.    

PREMIUM TAXES 

We make deductions for any applicable premium or similar taxes based on the     
amount of a premium payment. Currently, certain local jurisdictions assess a tax
of up to 5% of each premium payment.                                            

12

P-->485APOS13th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 13th
In most cases, we deduct a charge in the amount of the tax from the total value 
of the contract only at the time of annuitization. We reserve the right,        
however, to deduct the charge from each premium payment at the time it is made  
or, upon death surrender or withdrawal, if we incur such a tax upon those       
events. We compute the amount of the charge by multiplying the applicable       
premium tax percentage times the amount you are withdrawing, surrendering,      
annuitizing or applying to a death benefit.                                     

HOW CAN I WITHDRAW MONEY FROM MY CONTRACT?                                      

SURRENDERS AND PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS 

Prior to your contract's date of maturity, if the annuitant is living, you may: 

     -     surrender (i.e., "turn in") your contract for a cash payment of its
surrender value, or                                     

-     make a partial withdrawal of the surrender value.             

The surrender value of a contract is the total value of a contract, minus any   
applicable premium tax. You may request a surrender by writing to our           
Administrative Serving Office. We will determine the amount surrendered as of   
the date we receive your request in writing at the Administrative Servicing     
Office.                                                                         

You may request a partial withdrawal of the surrender value by writing to our   
Administrative Serving Office. You may also request a partial withdrawal of up  
to $50,000 of the surrender value by sending us acceptable notice through our   
Electronic Servicing Center. We will determine the amount withdrawn as of the   
date we receive your request in proper order.                                   

Certain surrenders and withdrawals may result in taxable income to you or other 
tax consequences as described in section AI-9 "Tax information" in the          
Additional Information portion of this prospectus. Among other things, if you   
make a full surrender or partial withdrawal from your contract before you reach 
age 59 1/2, an additional federal penalty of 10% generally applies to any       
portion taxable of the withdrawal taxable.                                      

We will deduct any partial withdrawal proportionally from each of your variable 
investment options based on the value in each, unless you direct otherwise.     

Without our prior approval, you may not make a partial withdrawal               

-     for an amount less than $300, or                              

  -     if the remaining total value of your contract would be less than
$1,000.                                                 

A partial withdrawal is not a loan and cannot be repaid. We reserve the right to
terminate your contract if the value of your contract becomes zero.             

You generally may not make any surrenders or partial withdrawals once we begin  
making payments under an annuity option.                                        

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PLAN 

Our optional systematic withdrawal plan enables you to preauthorize periodic    
withdrawals. If you elect this plan, we will withdraw a dollar amount from your 
contract on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis, based upon your  
instructions. We will deduct the requested amount from each applicable variable 
investment option in the ratio that the value of each bears to the total value  
of your contract. (See "How will the value of my contract change over time?")   
The same tax consequences also generally will apply.                            

The following conditions apply to systematic withdrawal plans:                  

 -     you may elect the plan only if the total value of your contract
equals $25,000 or more.                                 

    -     the amount of each systematic withdrawal must equal at least $300.

      -     if the amount of each withdrawal drops below $300 or the total value
           of your contract becomes less that $5,000, we will suspend the plan
and notify you.                                         

-     you may cancel the plan at any time.                          

    -     we reserve the right to modify the terms or conditions of the plan
at any time without prior notice.                       

WHAT HAPPENS IF THE ANNUITANT DIES BEFORE MY CONTRACT'S DATE OF MATURITY?       

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT 

If the annuitant dies before your contract's date of maturity, we will pay a    
death benefit, that is the greater of:                                          

-     the total value of your contract, or                          

13

P-->485APOS14th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 14th
-     the total amount of premium payments made, minus any partial  
withdrawals.                                            

We calculate the death benefit as of the day we receive, in proper order at the 
Administrative Servicing Office:                                                

-     proof of the annuitant's death, and                           

-     any required instructions as to method of settlement.         

If your contract names joint annuitants, the death benefit is determined on the 
death of the last surviving annuitant before your contract's date of maturity.  

Unless you have elected an optional method of settlement, we will pay the death 
benefit in a single sum to the beneficiary you chose prior to the annuitant's   
death. If you have not elected an optional method of settlement, the beneficiary
may do so. However, if the death benefit is less than $5,000, we will pay it in 
a lump sum, regardless of any election. You can find more information about     
optional methods of settlement under section AI-5 "The anuity period" in the    
Additional Information portion of this prospectus.                              

The Administrative Servicing Office's current address is shown on the Cover     
Pages of this prospectus.                                                       

CAN I RETURN MY CONTRACT? 

In most cases, you have the right to cancel your contract within 10 days (or    
longer in some states) after you receive it. The "right to cancel period"       
applicable to your contract will be shown in your contract or in a supplemental 
notice that is issued with your contract. Any premiums we receive during this   
period will be allocated to the Money Market variable investment option. If you 
do not cancel your contract during this period, we will transfer the total value
of your contract at the expiration of the right to cancel period to the variable
investment options you selected in your application.                            

To cancel your contract, simply deliver or mail it to the Administrative        
Servicing Office at the address shown on the Cover Pages or submit a surrender  
form available through the Electronic Servicing Center. In most states, you will
receive a refund equal to the total value of your contract on the date of       
cancellation, increased by any charges for premium taxes deducted by us to that 
date. In some states and for contracts issued as "IRAs," you will receive a     
refund of any premiums you've paid. The date of cancellation will be the date we
receive the contract or surrender form.                                         

WHO SHOULD PURCHASE A CONTRACT?                                                 

We designed these contracts for individuals doing their own retirement planning,
including purchases under plans and trusts that do not qualify for special tax  
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). We also offer   
the contracts for purchase under:                                               

      -     traditional individual retirement annuity plans ("Traditional IRAs")
   satisfying the requirements of Section 408 of the Code; and

    -     non-deductible IRA plans ("Roth IRAs") satisfying the requirements
of Section 408A of the Code.                            

We do not currently offer the contracts to every type of tax-qualified plan, and
we may not offer the contracts for all types of tax-qualified plans in the      
future. We provide general federal income tax information for contracts in      
section AI-9 "Tax information" in this Additional Information portion of the    
prospectus.                                                                     

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

This portion of the prospectus contains additional information that is not      
contained in the Basic Information portion of the prospectus.                   

DESCRIPTION OF JHVLICO                                                          

We are JHVLICO, a stock life insurance company chartered in 1979 under          
Massachusetts law, with its home office at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston,        
Massachusetts 02117. We are authorized to transact a life insurance and annuity 
business in all states other than New York and in the District of Columbia.     

We are regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance, 
who periodically examines our affairs. We also are subject to the applicable    
insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which we are authorized  
to do business. We are required to submit annual statements of our operations,  
including financial statements, to the insurance departments of the various     
jurisdictions

in which we do business for purposes of determining solvency and compliance with
local insurance laws and regulations. The regulation to which we are subject,   
however, does not provide a guarantee as to such matters.                       

We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Hancock Life Insurance Company ("John
Hancock"), a Massachusetts stock life insurance company. On February 1, 2000,   
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (which was chartered in Massachusetts
in 1862) converted to a stock company by "demutualizing" and changed its name to
John Hancock Life Insurance Company. As part of the demutualization process,    
John Hancock became a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a    
newly formed publicly-traded corporation. In April 2004, John Hancock Financial 
Services, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation, a
publicly-traded corporation organized under the laws of Canada. The merger was  
effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 28,
2003. As a consequence of the merger, John Hancock's ultimate parent is now     
Manulife Financial Corporation. John Hancock's home office is at John Hancock   
Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02117. As of December 31, 2003, John Hancock's     
assets were approximately $96 billion and it had invested approximately $575    
million in JHVLICO in connection with JHVLICO's organization and operation. It  
is anticipated that John Hancock will from time to time make additional capital 
contributions to JHVLICO to enable us to meet our reserve requirements and      
expenses in connection with our business. John Hancock is committed to make     
additional capital contributions if necessary to ensure that we maintain a      
positive net worth.                                                             

HOW WE SUPPORT THE VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS                                  

We hold the Fund shares that support our variable investment options in         
Sub-Accounts of John Hancock Variable Annuity Account I (the "Account"), a      
separate account established by JHVLICO under Massachusetts law. The Account is 
registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940  
("1940 Act").                                                                   

The Account's assets, including the Funds' shares, belong to JHVLICO. Each      
contract provides that amounts we hold in the Account pursuant to the policies  
cannot be reached by any other persons who may have claims against us.          

All of JHVLICO's general assets also support JHVLICO's obligations under the    
contracts, as well as all of its other obligations and liabilities. These       
general assets consist of all JHVLICO's assets that are not held in the Account 
(or in another separate account) under variable annuity or variable life        
insurance contracts that give their owners a preferred claim on those assets.   

INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS.                                                    

We may receive compensation from the Funds of the investment advisors of the    
Funds for services related to the Funds. Such compensation will be consistent   
with the services rendered as the cost savings resulting from the arrangement.  

We invest the assets of each Sub-Account in NAV shares of a corresponding Fund  
of the Series Fund. The Funds available under the contracts are as follows:

PORTFOLIO         PORTFOLIO MANAGER      INVESTMENT DESCRIPTION                        
----------------  ---------------------  ----------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES AT THE FUND LEVEL                                        
THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD                                                         

YOUR VALUE IN OUR VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS 

Each premium payment or transfer that you allocate to a variable investment     
option purchases accumulation units of that variable investment option.         
Similarly, each withdrawal or transfer that you take from a variable investment 
option (as well as certain charges that may be allocated to that option) results
in a cancellation of such accumulation units.                                   

VALUATION OF ACCUMULATION UNITS 

To determine the number of accumulation units that a specific transaction will  
purchase or cancel, we use the following formula:                               

dollar amount of transaction    
                      DIVIDED BY
                 value of one accumulation unit for the applicable
              variable investment option at the time of such
transaction                     

The value of each accumulation unit will change daily depending upon the        
investment performance of the fund that corresponds to that variable investment 
option and certain charges we deduct from such variable investment option. (See 
below under "Variable investment option valuation procedures.")                 

Therefore, at any time prior to the date of maturity, the total value of your   
contract in a variable investment option can be computed according to the       
following formula:                                                              

number of accumulation units in the variable investment options                 

     TIMES
         value of one accumulation unit for the applicable
variable investment option that time    

THE ANNUITY PERIOD 

DATE OF MATURITY 

Your contract specifies the annuitant's 95th birthday as the date of maturity,  
when payments from one of our annuity options are scheduled to begin. You may   
subsequently elect a different date of maturity by sending us acceptable notice 
through our Electronic Servicing center or by writing to our Administrative     
Serving Office. Unless we otherwise permit, a new selection must be             

-     at least 12 months after the date the first premium payment is
applied to your contract and                            

-     no later than the annuitant's 95th birthday.                  

We must receive your new selection in proper form at least 31 days prior to the 
new date of maturity.

If you are selecting or changing your date of maturity for a contract issued    
under an IRA, special limits apply. (See "Contracts purchased as traditional    
IRAs," in AI-9 "Tax Information," below.)                                       

CHOOSING VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

During the annuity period, we offer annuity payments on a variable basis for    
each variable investment option.                                                

We will generally apply amounts allocated to variable investment options to     
provide annuity payments on a variable basis.                                   

SELECTING AN ANNUITY OPTION 

Each contract provides, at the time of its issuance, for annuity payments to    
commence on the date of maturity pursuant to Option A: "life annuity with 10    
years guaranteed" (discussed below under Annuity options).                      

Prior to the date of maturity, you may select a different annuity option.       
However, if the total value of your contract on the date of maturity is not at  
least $5,000, Option A: "life annuity with 10 years guaranteed" will apply,     
regardless of any other election that you have made. You may not change the form
of annuity option once payments commence.                                       

If the initial monthly payment under an annuity option would be less than $50,  
we may make a single sum payment equal to the total surrender value of your     
contract on the date the initial payment would be payable. Such single payment  
would replace all other benefits. Alternatively, if you agree, we will make     
payments at quarterly, semi-annual, or annual intervals in place of monthly     
payments.                                                                       

Subject to that $50 minimum limitation, your beneficiary may elect an annuity   
option if                                                                       

-     you have not made an election prior to the annuitant's death; 

 -     the beneficiary is entitled to payment of a death benefit of at
least $5,000 in a single sum; and                       

   -     the beneficiary notifies us of the election prior to the date the
proceeds become payable.                                

You may also elect to have the surrender value of your contract applied to an   
annuity option at the time of full surrender if your contract has been          
outstanding for at least 6 months. If the total value of your contract, at death
or surrender, is less than $5,000, no annuity option will be available.         

VARIABLE MONTHLY ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

We determine the amount of the first variable monthly payment under any variable
investment option by using the applicable annuity purchase rate for the annuity 
option under which the payment will be made. The contract sets forth these      
annuity purchase rates. In most cases they vary by the age and gender of the    
annuitant or other payee.                                                       

The amount of each subsequent variable annuity payment under that variable      
investment option depends upon the investment performance of that variable      
investment option. Here's how it works:                                         

-     we calculate the actual net investment return of the variable 
         investment option (after deducting all charges) during the period
     between the dates for determining the current and immediately
previous monthly payments.                              

      -     if that actual net investment return exceeds the "assumed investment
rate" (explained below), the current monthly payment will be larger
than the previous one.                                  

-     if the actual net investment return is less than the assumed  
         investment rate, the current monthly payment will be smaller than
the previous one.                                       

Assumed investment rate: The assumed investment rate for any variable portion of
your annuity payments will be 3-1/2% per year, except as follows.               

You may elect an assumed investment rate of 5% or 6%, provided such a rate is   
available in your state. If you elect a higher assumed investment rate, your    
initial variable annuity payment will also be higher. Eventually, however, the  
monthly variable annuity payments may be smaller than if you had elected a lower
assumed investment rate.                                                        

ANNUITY OPTIONS 

Here are some of the annuity options that are available, subject to the terms   
and conditions described above. We reserve the right to make available optional 
methods of payment in addition to those annuity options listed here and in your 
contract.                                                                       

OPTION A - LIFE ANNUITY WITH Payments FOR A GUARANTEED PERIOD - We will make    
monthly payments for a guaranteed period of 5, 10, or 20 years, as selected by  
you or your beneficiary, and after such period for as long as the payee lives.  
If the payee dies prior to the end of such guaranteed period, we will continue  
payments for the remainder of the guarantee period to a contingent payee,       
subject to the terms of any supplemental agreement issued.                      

24

P-->485APOS25th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
Federal income tax requirements currently applicable to contracts used with     
individual retirement annuities provide that the period of years guaranteed     
under Option A cannot be any greater than the joint life expectancies of the    
payee and his or her designated beneficiary.                                    

OPTION B - LIFE ANNUITY WITHOUT FURTHER PAYMENT ON DEATH OF PAYEE - We will make
monthly payments to the payee as long as he or she lives. We guarantee no       
minimum number of payments.                                                     

If the payee is more than 95 years old on the date of maturity, the following   
two options are not available:                                                  

-     Option A: "life annuity with 5 years guaranteed" and          

 -     Option B: "life annuity without further payment on the death of
payee."

VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTION VALUATION PROCEDURES 

We compute the net investment return and accumulation unit values for each      
variable investment option as of the end of each business day. A business day is
any date on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for regular trading. Each 
business day ends at the close of regular trading for the day on that exchange. 
Usually this is 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. On any date other than a business day, 
the accumulation unit value or annuity unit value will be the same as the value 
at the close of the next following business day.                                

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWING DEATH OF OWNER 

If you did not purchase your contract under a tax-qualified plan (as that term  
is used below), the Code requires that the following distribution provisions    
apply if you die. We summarize these provisions in the box below. In most cases,
these provisions do not cause a problem if you are also the annuitant under your
policy. If you have designated someone other than yourself as the annuitant,    
however, your heirs will have less discretion than you would have had in        
determining when and how the contract's value would be paid out.                

IF YOU DIE BEFORE ANNUITY PAYMENTS HAVE BEGUN:                                  

   - If the contract's designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, your
spouse may continue the                                           

The Code imposes very similar distribution requirements on contracts used to    
fund individual retirement annuity plans. We provide the required provisions for
tax-qualified plans in separate disclosures and endorsements.                   

The Electronic Servicing Center contains instructions on how to provide notice  
of the death of an owner or annuitant to us, and how to file a claim at the     
Administrative Servicing Office. Notice of the death of an owner or annuitant   
should be furnished promptly.                                                   

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS                                                        

CHANGE OF OWNER OR BENEFICIARY 

The Electronic Servicing Center provides instructions on how to change the owner
or beneficiary under your contract.                                             

To qualify for favorable tax treatment, certain contracts can't be sold,        
assigned, discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan, as security for the  
performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose. Subject to these limits,
while the annuitant is alive, you may designate someone else as the owner by    
written notice to the Administrative Servicing Office.                          

The contract designates the person you choose as beneficiary. You may change the
beneficiary by written notice to the Administrative Servicing Office no later   
than receipt of due proof of the death of the annuitant.                        

Changes of owner or beneficiary will take effect whether or not you or the      
annuitant is then alive. However, these changes are subject to:                 

-     the rights of any assignees of record,                        

-     the any action taken prior to receipt of the notice, and      

-     certain other conditions.                                     

An assignment, pledge, or other transfer may be a taxable event. See "Tax
information" below. Therefore, you should consult a competent tax adviser before
taking any such action.

TAX INFORMATION 

OUR INCOME TAXES 

We are taxed as a life insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code (the   
"Code"). The Account is taxed as part of our operations and is not taxed        
separately.                                                                     

The contracts permit us to deduct a charge for any taxes we incur that are      
attributable to the operation or existence of the contracts or the Account.     
Currently, we do not anticipate making a charge of such taxes. If the level of  
the current taxes increases, however, or is expected to increase in the future, 
we reserve the right to make a charge in the future.                            

CONTRACTS NOT PURCHASED TO FUND A TAX QUALIFIED PLAN 

UNDISTRIBUTED GAINS 

We believe the contracts will be considered annuity contracts under Section 72  
of the Code. This means that, ordinarily, you pay no federal income tax on any  
gains in your contract until we actually distribute assets to you.              

However, a contract owned other than by a natural person (e.g., corporations,   
partnerships, limited liability companies and other such entities) does not     
generally qualify as an annuity for tax purposes. Any increase in value         
therefore would constitute ordinary taxable income to such an owner in the year 
earned.                                                                         

ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

When we make payments under a contract in the form of an annuity, each payment  
will result in taxable ordinary income to you, to the extent that each such     
payment exceeds an allocable portion of your "investment in the contract" (as   
defined in the Code). In general, your "investment in the contract" equals the  
aggregate amount of premium payments you have made over the life of the         
contract, reduced by any amounts previously distributed from the contract that  
were not subject to tax.                                                        

The Code prescribes the allocable portion of each such annuity payment to be    
excluded from income according to one formula if the payments are variable and a
somewhat different formula if the payments are fixed. In each case, speaking    
generally, the formula seeks to allocate an appropriate amount of the investment
in the contract to each payment. After the entire "investment in the contract"  
has been distributed, any remaining payment is fully taxable.                   

SURRENDERS, WITHDRAWALS AND DEATH BENEFITS 

When we make a single sum payment from a contract, you have ordinary taxable    
income, to the extent the payment exceeds your "investment in the contract"     
(discussed above). Such a single sum payment can occur, for example, if you     
surrender your contract before the date of maturity or if no annuity payment    
option is selected for a death benefit payment.                                 

When you take a partial withdrawal from a contract before the date of maturity, 
including a payment under a systematic withdrawal plan, all or part of the      
payment may constitute taxable ordinary income to you. If, on the date of       
withdrawal, the total value of your contract exceeds the investment in the      
contract, the excess will be considered "gain" and the withdrawal will be       
taxable as ordinary income up to the amount of such "gain". Taxable withdrawals 
may also be subject to the special penalty tax for premature withdrawals as     
explained below. When only the investment in the contract remains, any          
subsequent withdrawal made before the date of maturity will be a tax-free return
of investment. If you assign or pledge any part of your contract's value, the   
value so pledged or assigned is taxed the same way as if it were a partial      
withdrawal.                                                                     

For purposes of determining the amount of taxable income resulting from a single
sum payment or a partial withdrawal, all annuity contracts issued by JHVLICO or 
its affiliates to the owner within the same calendar year will be treated as if 
they were a single contract.                                                    

All or part of any death benefit proceeds may constitute a taxable payout of    
earnings. A death benefit payment generally results in taxable ordinary income  
to the extent such payment exceeds your "investment in the contract."           

Under the Code, an annuity must provide for certain required distributions. For 
example, if the owner dies on or after the maturity date, and before the entire 
annuity value has been paid, the remaining value must be distributed at least as
rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the       
owner's death. We discuss other distribution requirements in the preceding      
section entitled "Distribution requirements following death of owner."

PENALTY FOR PREMATURE WITHDRAWALS 

The taxable portion of any withdrawal, single sum payment and certain death     
benefit payment may also trigger an additional 10% penalty tax. The penalty tax 
does not apply to payments made to you after age 59-1/2, or on account of your  
death or disability. Nor will                                                   

26

P-->485APOS27th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 27th
it apply to withdrawals in substantially equal periodic payments over the life  
of the payee (or over the joint lives of the payee and the payee's beneficiary).

PUERTO RICO ANNUITY CONTRACTS NOT PURCHASED TO FUND A TAX QUALIFIED PLAN        

Under the Puerto Rico tax laws, distributions from a contract not purchased to  
fund a tax qualified plan ("Non-Qualified Contract") before annuitization are   
treated as non-taxable return of principal until the principal is fully         
recovered. Thereafter, all distributions are fully taxable. Distributions after 
annuitization are treated as part taxable income and part non-taxable return of 
principal. The amount excluded from gross income after annuitization is equal to
the amount of the distribution in excess of 3% of the total purchase payments   
paid, until an amount equal to the total purchase payments paid has been        
excluded. Thereafter, the entire distribution from a Non-Qualified Contract is  
included in gross income. Puerto Rico does not currently impose an early        
withdrawal penalty tax. Generally, Puerto Rico does not require income tax to be
withheld from distributions of income.                                          

DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS                                                    

Each of the funds of the Series Fund intends to qualify as a regulated          
investment company under Subchapter M of the Code and meet the investment       
diversification tests of Section 817(h) of the Code and the underlying          
regulations. Failure to do so could result in current taxation to you on gains  
in your contract for the year in which such failure occurred and thereafter.    

The Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service may, at some future     
time, issue a ruling or regulation presenting situations in which it will deem  
contract owners to exercise "investor control" over the fund shares that are    
attributable to their contracts. The Treasury Department has said informally    
that this could limit the number or frequency of transfers among variable       
investment options. This could cause you to be taxed as if you were the direct  
owner of your allocable portion of fund shares. We reserve the right to amend   
the contracts or the choice of investment options to avoid, if possible, current
taxation to the owners.                                                         

CONTRACTS PURCHASED FOR IRAS 

TRADITIONAL IRAS 

ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT. A traditional individual retirement annuity (as      
defined in Section 408 of the Code) generally permits an eligible purchaser to  
make annual contributions which cannot exceed the lesser of:                    

-     100% of compensation includable in your gross income, or      

    -     the IRA annual limit for that tax year. For tax years beginning in
         2002, 2003 and 2004, the annual limit is $3,000 per year. For tax
          years beginning in 2005, 2006 and 2007, the annual limit is $4,000
          per year and, for the tax year beginning in 2008, the annual limit
           is $5,000. After that, the annual limit is indexed for inflation in
$500 increments as provided in the Code.                

CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS. An IRA holder age 50 or older may increase contributions
from compensation to an IRA by an amount up to $500 a year for tax years        
beginning in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and by an amount up to $1,000 for the   
tax year beginning in 2006.                                                     

SPOUSAL IRA. You may also purchase an IRA contract for the benefit of your      
spouse (regardless of whether your spouse has a paying job). You can generally  
contribute up to the annual limit for each of you and your spouse (or, if less, 
your combined compensation).                                                    

DEDUCTIBILITY OF CONTRIBUTIONS. You may be entitled to a full deduction, a      
partial deduction or no deduction for your traditional IRA contribution on your 
federal income tax return.                                                      

The amount of your deduction is based on the following factors:                 

    -     whether you or your spouse is an active participant in an employer
sponsored retirement plan,                              

-     your federal income tax filing status, and                    

-     your "Modified Adjusted Gross Income."                        

Your traditional IRA deduction is subject to phase out limits, based on your    
Modified Adjusted Gross Income, which are applicable according to your filing   
status and whether you or your spouse are active participants in an employer    
sponsored retirement plan. You can still contribute to a traditional IRA even if
your contributions are not deductible.                                          

DISTRIBUTIONS. In general, all amounts paid out from a traditional IRA contract 
(in the form of an annuity, a single sum, death benefits or partial withdrawal),
are taxable to the payee as ordinary income. As in the case of a contract not   
purchased under a tax-qualified plan, you may incur additional adverse tax      
consequences if you make a surrender or withdrawal before you reach age 59-1/2  

27

P-->485APOS28th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 28th
(unless certain exceptions apply as specified in Code section 72(t)). If you    
have made any non-deductible contributions to an IRA contract, all or part of   
any withdrawal or surrender proceeds, single sum death benefit or annuity       
payment, may be excluded from your taxable income when you receive the proceeds.

The tax law requires that annuity payments under a traditional IRA contract     
begin no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which the owner   
attains age 70-1/2.                                                             

ROTH IRAS 

ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION LIMIT. A Roth IRA is a type of non-deductible IRA. In       
general, you may make purchase payments of up to the IRA annual limit ($3,000   
per year for tax years beginning in 2002, 2003 and 2004; $4,000 per year for tax
years beginning in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and $5,000 for the tax year beginning in
2008). After that, the annual limit is indexed for inflation in $500 increments 
as provided in the Code.                                                        

The IRA annual limit for contributions to a Roth IRA phases out (i.e., is       
reduced) for single taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes between $95,000 and   
$110,000, for married taxpayers filing jointly with adjusted gross incomes      
between $150,000 and $160,000, and for a married taxpayer filing separately with
adjusted gross income between $0 and $10,000.                                   

CATCH-UP CONTRIBUTIONS. A Roth IRA holder age 50 or older may increase          
contributions from compensation to an IRA by an amount up to $500 a year for tax
years beginning in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, and by an amount up to $1,000 for 
the tax year beginning in 2006.                                                 

SPOUSAL IRA. You may also purchase a Roth IRA contract for the benefit of your  
spouse (regardless of whether your spouse has a paying job). You can generally  
contribute up to the annual limit for each of you and your spouse (or, if less, 
your combined compensation), subject to the phase-out rules discussed above.    

DISTRIBUTIONS. If you hold your Roth IRA for at least five years the payee will 
not owe any federal income taxes or early withdrawal penalties on amounts paid  
out from the contract:                                                          

-     after you reach age 59-1/2,                                   

-     on your death or disability, or                               

-     to qualified first-time home buyers (not to exceed a lifetime 
limitation of $10,000) as specified in the Code.        

The Code treats payments you receive from Roth IRAs that do not qualify for the 
above tax free treatment first as a tax-free return of the contributions you    
made. However, any amount of such non-qualifying payments or distributions that 
exceed the amount of your contributions is taxable to you as ordinary income and
possibly subject to the 10% penalty tax (unless certain exceptions apply as     
specified in Code section 72(t).                                                

CONVERSION TO A ROTH IRA. You can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA,      
unless                                                                          

-     you have adjusted gross income over $100,000, or              

-     you are a married taxpayer filing a separate return.          

The Roth IRA annual contribution limit does not apply to converted amounts.     

You must, however, pay tax on any portion of the converted amount that would    
have been taxed if you had not converted to a Roth IRA. No similar limitations  
apply to rollovers from one Roth IRA to another Roth IRA.                       

TAX-FREE ROLLOVERS TO AND FROM IRAS 

For tax years beginning in 2002, if permitted under your plans, you may make a  
tax-free rollover from:                                                         

-     a traditional IRA to another traditional IRA,                 

      -     a traditional IRA to another tax-qualified plan, including a Section
403(b) plan                                             

-     any tax-qualified plan (other than a Section 457 deferred     
       compensation plan maintained by a tax-exempt organization) to a
traditional IRA,                                        

-     any tax-qualified plan (other than a Section 457 deferred     
     compensation plan maintained by a tax exempt organization) to
         another tax-qualified plan, including a roll-over of amounts from
        your prior plan derived from your "after-tax" contributions from
"involuntary" distributions,                            

     -     a Section 457 deferred compensation plan maintained by a tax-exempt
      organization to another Section 457 deferred compensation plan
maintained by a tax-exempt organization and

  -     a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, subject to special restrictions
discussed below.                                        

In addition, if your spouse survives you, he or she is permitted to rollover    
your tax-qualified retirement account to another tax-qualified retirement       
account in which your surviving spouse participates, to the extent permitted by 
your surviving spouse' plan.                                                    

WITHHOLDING ON ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS 

The tax law requires us to withhold 20% from certain distributions from tax     
qualified plans. We do not have to make the withholding, however, if you        
rollover your entire distribution to another plan and you request us to pay it  
directly to the successor plan. Otherwise, the 20% mandatory withholding will   
reduce the amount you can rollover to the new plan, unless you add funds to the 
rollover from other sources. Consult a qualified tax adviser before making such 
a distribution.                                                                 

PUERTO RICO ANNUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED TO FUND A TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN 

The provisions of the tax laws of Puerto Rico vary significantly from those     
under the Internal Revenue Code of the United States with respect to the various
"tax qualified" plans described above. Although we may offer variable annuity   
contracts in Puerto Rico in connection with "tax qualified" plans, the text of  
the prospectus under the subsection "Contracts purchased for IRAs" is           
inapplicable in Puerto Rico and should be disregarded.                          

SEE YOUR OWN TAX ADVISER 

The above description of Federal (and Puerto Rico) income tax consequences to   
owners of and payees under contracts is only a brief summary and is not intended
as tax advice. It does not include a discussion of federal estate and gift tax  
or state tax consequences. The rules under the Code governing tax qualified     
plans are extremely complex and often difficult to understand. Changes to the   
tax laws may be enforced retroactively. Anything less than full compliance with 
the applicable rules, all of which are subject to change from time to time, can 
have adverse tax consequences. The taxation of an annuitant or other payee has  
become so complex and confusing that great care must be taken to avoid pitfalls.
For further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser.             

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

We may advertise total return information about investments made in the variable
investment options. We refer to this information as "Account level" performance.
In our Account level advertisements, we usually calculate total return for 1, 5,
and 10 year periods or since the beginning of the applicable variable investment
option.                                                                         

Total return at the Account level is the percentage change between:             

 -     the value of a hypothetical investment in a variable investment
option at the beginning of the relevant period; and     

-     the value at the end of such period.                          

At the Account level, total return reflects adjustments for the asset-based risk
charge. Total return at the Account level does not, however, reflect any premium
tax charges. Total return at the Account level will be lower than that at the   
Series Fund level where comparable charges are not deducted.                    

We may also advertise total return in a non-standard format in conjunction with 
the standard format described above. The non-standard format is generally the   
same as the standard format except that it may be for additional durations.     

We may also advertise "current yield" and "effective yield" for investments in  
the Money Market variable investment option. Current yield refers to the income 
earned on your investment in the Money Market variable investment option over a 
7-day period an then annualized. In other words, the income earned in the period
is assumed to be earned every 7 days over a 52-week period and stated as a      
percentage of the investment.                                                   

Effective yield is calculated in a similar manner but, when annualized, the     
income earned by your investment is assumed to be reinvested and thus compounded
over the 52-week period. Effective yield will be slightly higher than current   
yield because of this compounding effect of reinvestment.                       

Current yield and effective yield reflect all the recurring charges at the      
Account level, but will not reflect any premium tax .                           

REPORTS                                                                         

At least semi-annually, we will send you (1) a report showing the number and    
value of the accumulation units in your contract and (2) the financial          
statements of the Series Funds.

VOTING PRIVILEGES 

At meetings of a Series Fund's shareholders, we will generally vote all the     
shares of each Fund that we hold in the Account in accordance with instructions 
we receive from the owners of contracts that participate in the corresponding   
variable investment option.                                                     

CERTAIN CHANGES 

CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNT 

We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, including any required         
shareholder approval,                                                           

 -     to transfer assets that we determine to be your assets from the
   Account to another separate account or investment option by
         withdrawing the same percentage of each investment in the Account
with proper adjustments to avoid odd lots and fractions,

-     to add or delete variable investment options,                 

-     to change the underlying investment vehicles,                 

-     to operate the Account in any form permitted by law, and      

     -     to terminate the Account's registration under the 1940 Act, if such
registration should no longer be legally required.      

Unless otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations, notice to or   
approval of owners will not be necessary for us to make such changes.           

VARIATIONS IN CHARGES OR RATES FOR ELIGIBLE CLASSES 

We may allow a reduction in or the elimination of any contract charges. The     
affected contracts would involve sales to groups or classes of individuals under
special circumstances that we expect to result in a reduction in our expenses   
associated with the sale or maintenance of the contracts, or that we expect to  
result in mortality or other risks that are different from those normally       
associated with the contracts.                                                  

The entitlement to such variation in charges or rates will be determined by us  
based upon such factors as the following:                                       

-     the size of the initial premium payment,                      

-     the size of the group or class,                               

   -     the total amount of premium payments expected to be received from
           the group or class and the manner in which the premium payments are
remitted,                                               

    -     the nature of the group or class for which the contracts are being
          purchased and the persistency expected from that group or class as
           well as the mortality or morbidity risks associated with that group
or class;                                               

     -     the purpose for which the contracts are being purchased and whether
        that purpose makes it likely that the costs and expenses will be
reduced, or                                             

    -     the level of commissions paid to selling broker-dealers or certain
        financial institutions with respect to contracts within the same
group or class.                                         

We will make any reduction in charges according to our rules in effect at the   
time an application for a contract is approved. We reserve the right to change  
these rules from time to time. Any variation in charges will reflect differences
in costs and services, will apply uniformly to all prospective contract         
purchasers in the group or class, and will not be unfairly discriminatory to the
interests of any owner. Any variation in charges or fees will reflect           
differences in costs and services, will apply uniformly to all prospective      
contract purchasers in the group or class, and will not be unfairly             
discriminatory to the interests of any owner.                                   

DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS                                                       

Signator Investors, Inc. ("Signator") acts as principal distributor of the      
contracts sold through this prospectus. Signator is registered as a             
broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the     
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Its address is 197 Clarendon

Life Insurance Company.                                                         

You can purchase the contracts through broker-dealers who have entered into     
selling agreements with Signator and JHVLICO. We do not expect the compensation 
of such broker-dealers and their affiliated life insurance agencies to exceed 8%
of premium payments (on a present value basis).

CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE DATA 

The Account may, from time to time, include in advertisements, sales literature 
and reports to owners or prospective investors information relating to the      
performance of its variable investment options. The performance information that
may be presented is not an estimate or a guarantee of future investment         
performance, and does not represent the actual experience of amounts invested by
a particular owner. Set out below is a description of the methods used in       
calculating the performance information for the variable investment options.    

MONEY MARKET VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTION 

We may calculate current yield and effective yield figures for the money market 
variable investment options held in the Account. The current yield of a money   
market option for a seven-day period ("base period") will be computed by        
determining the "net change in value" (calculated as set forth below) for a     
hypothetical owner having an account balance of one unit in a money market      
variable investment option at the beginning of the period, dividing the net     
change in value by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period 
to obtain the base period return, and multiplying the base period return by     
365/7, with the resulting yield figure carried to the nearest hundredth of one  
percent. Net changes in value of the hypothetical owner account will include net
investment income of that account (accrued daily dividends as declared by the   
applicable money market fund, less daily expenses of the Account) for the       
period, but will not include realized gains or losses or unrealized appreciation
or depreciation on that underlying money market fund's shares. The applicable   
risk based charges, mortality and expense risk charges, administration charge   
and contract fee are reflected, but any charge for premium taxes and optional   
benefits are not.                                                               

The effective yield reflects the effects of compounding and represents an       
annualization of the current return. The formula for effective yield, as        
prescribed by the SEC, is:                                                      

   Effective yield = (Base period return + 1)((365/7)) - 1

OTHER VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS 
"STANDARDIZED" TOTAL RETURN                                                     

Average annual total return is the annual compounded rate of return for a       
variable investment option that would have produced the ending redeemable value 
over the stated period if the performance remained constant throughout. The     
calculation assumes a single $1,000 premium payment is made into the variable   
investment option at the beginning of the period and full redemption is made at 
the end of the period. It reflects adjustments for all Series Fund-level and    
contract-level charges, except any premium tax charge or charges for optional   
rider benefits described in the prospectus. The annual contract fee has been    
included as an annual percentage of assets.                                     

We calculate the average annual total return for each variable investment       
option, other than the money market variable investment option, according to the
following "Standard" formula prescribed by the SEC:                             

  P x ( 1 + T )(n) = ERV

    where          P = a hypothetical initial premium payment of
$1,000            
     T = average annual total return

3 

P-->485APOS36th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 36th
n = number of years       
                    ERV = ending redeemable value of ahypothetical
                                $1,000 premium payment, made at the beginning of
                           such period (or fractional portion thereof)

We calculate values for one, three and five year periods, or fractional period  
thereof starting on the date a variable investment option was first available in
the Account. We also calculate values from the date a variable investment option
was first available in the Account. We do not calculate ten year periods because
the Account did not commence operations until 1995. Returns of less than one    
year are not annualized. The inception date may be different from the date a    
variable investment option was first available in the contracts because the     
Account is used for other variable annuities offered by us.                     

YIELD 

We may calculate current yield for each variable investment option, other than  
the money market variable investment options, according to the following formula
prescribed by the SEC:                                                          

   yield = 2[(a-b/cd+ 1)(6)-1]

  where:  a = net investment income earned during the period by the fund
            whose shares are owned by the variable investment option
           b = expenses accrued for the period (net of any reimbursements)
          c = the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding
during the period                           
        d = the offering price per accumulation unit on the last day
of the period                               

According to this formula, yield is determined by dividing the net investment   
income per accumulation unit earned during the period (minus the deduction for  
mortality and expense risk charge, administration charge and annual contract    
fee) by the accumulation unit value on the last day of the period and           
annualizing the resulting figure. The calculation is based on specified 30      
day-periods identified in the advertisement. Charges for premium taxes or       
optional rider benefits are not reflected in the calculation.                   

"NON-STANDARDIZED" PERFORMANCE                                                  

We may calculate "non-standardized" average annual total returns for each       
variable investment option. The calculation assumes a single $1,000 premium     
payment is made into the variable investment option at the beginning of the     
period and NO redemption is made at the end of the period. It reflects          
adjustments for all Series Fund-level and contract-level charges, except any    
premium tax charge, withdrawal charge, annual contract fee, or charges for      
optional rider benefits described in the prospectus.                            

"Non-standardized" average annual total returns for the eVariable Annuity       
contracts are shown in the prospectus.                                          

Although the contracts did not exist during all the periods for which we        
calculate "non-standardized" performance, we adjust the returns of the variable 
investment options by the contracts' asset-based charge.

CALCULATION OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

4 

P-->485APOS37th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 37th
CALCULATION OF ANNUITY UNITS 

We use a measuring device called an "annuity unit" to help us compute the amount
of each monthly payment that is based on a variable investment option. Each     
variable investment option has its own annuity unit with its own annuity unit   
value.                                                                          

The number of the contract's annuity units for each variable investment option  
normally doesn't change while the payee continues to receive payments, unless   
the payee makes a transfer from one variable investment option to another. The  
amount of each monthly annuity payment based on a variable investment option    
equals the number of the contract's annuity units in that option times the value
of one such unit as of the tenth day preceding the payment's due date.          

To compute the amount of the first annuity payment that is based on any variable
investment option, we first determine the amount of your contract's value that  
we will apply to that variable option. We do this as of 10 calendar days prior  
to the date the initial monthly annuity payment is due, in the manner described 
in the prospectus under "The annuity period - choosing fixed or variable annuity
payments."                                                                      

For each variable investment option, we THEN divide:                            

the resulting value (minus any
 premium tax charge)

by

$1,000

and multiply the result by                                                      

 the applicable annuity purchase
rate set forth in the contract
and reflecting

                             (1) the age and, possibly, sex of the payee
and   
                            (2) the assumed investment rate (discussed
below)

This computation determines the amount of initial monthly variable annuity      
payment to the annuitant from each variable investment option.                  

We then determine the number of annuity units to be credited to the contract    
from each of such variable investment options by dividing:                      

 the amount of the initial monthly
variable annuity payment from that
 variable annuity option

by

the annuity unit value of that    
variable investment option as of  
10 calendar days prior to the     
date the initial payment is due   

For example, assume that 10 days before the date of maturity, a contract has    
credited to it 4000.000 accumulation units, each having a value of $12.000000.  
Assume, further, that the appropriate annuity purchase rate in the contract for 
an assumed investment rate of 3 1/2% is $5.47 per $1000 of proceeds for the     
annuity option elected. The first monthly annuity payment would be $262.56.     

5 

P-->485APOS38th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 38th
 4000.000 x 12.000000 x 5.47
 ---------------------------
 1,000

If the value of an annuity unit 10 days before the date of maturity was         
$1.4000000, the number of annuity units represented by the first and subsequent 
payments would be 187.543 ($262.56/$1.4000000). If the annuity unit value 10    
days before the due date of the second monthly payment was $1.405000, the amount
of the second payment would be $263.50 (187.543 x $1.405000).                   

ANNUITY UNIT VALUES 

The value of the annuity units varies from day to day, depending on the         
investment performance of the variable investment option, the deductions made   
against the variable investment option, and the assumed investment rate used in 
computing annuity unit values. Thus, the variable monthly annuity payments vary 
in amount from month to month.                                                  

We calculate annuity unit value separately for each variable investment option. 
As of the close of each business day, we calculate the value of one annuity unit
by                                                                              

     (1)   multiplying the immediately preceding annuity unit value by the sum
     of one plus the applicable net investment rate for the period
subsequent to such preceding value and then             

    (2)   multiplying this product by an adjustment factor to neutralize the
          assumed investment rate used in determining the amounts of annuity
          payable. If your contract has an assumed investment rate of 3 1/2%
         per year, the adjustment factor for a valuation period of one day
         would be 0.99990575. We neutralize the assumed investment rate by
            applying the adjustment factor so that the variable annuity payments
            will increase only if the actual net investment rate of the variable
           investment option exceeds 3 1/2% per year and will decrease only if
is less than 3 1/2% per year.                           

The amount of the initial variable monthly payment is determined on the         
assumption that the actual net investment rate of each variable investment      
option used in calculating the "net investment factor" (described below) will be
equal on an annual basis to the "assumed investment rate" (described under "The
annuity period - variable monthly annuity payments" in the prospectus). If the  
actual net investment rate between the dates for determining two monthly annuity
payments is greater than the assumed investment rate, the latter monthly payment
will be larger in amount than the former. On the other hand, if the actual net  
investment rate between the dates for determining two monthly annuity payments  
is less than the assumed investment rate, the latter monthly payment will be    
smaller in amount than the former.                                              

MORTALITY TABLES 

The mortality tables used as a basis for both variable and fixed annuity        
purchase rates are the 1983a Mortality Tables, with projections of mortality    
improvements and with certain age adjustments based on the contract year of     
annuitization. The mortality table used in a Contract purchased in connection   
with certain employer-related plans and used in all contracts issued in Montana 
will be the Female Annuity Table of the 1983a Mortality Tables. The impact of   
this change will be lower benefits (5% to 15%) from a male's viewpoint than     
would otherwise be the case.                                                    

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT DETERMINING UNIT VALUES 

The general manner in which we compute annuity unit values is discussed above.  
Like annuity unit values, we calculate accumulation unit values separately for  
each variable investment option. As of the close of each business day, we       
calculate the value of one accumulation unit of a variable investment option by 
multiplying the immediately preceding accumulation unit value by the sum of one 
plus the applicable "net investment rate" for the period subsequent to such     
preceding value. See "Net investment rate" below.

P-->485APOS39th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 39th
NET INVESTMENT RATE 

    For any period, the net investment rate for a variable investment option
equals                                                              

      (1)   the percentage total investment return of the corresponding fund for
     that period (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and other
distributions from the fund), less                      

      (2)   for each calendar day in the period, a deduction of 0.001781% of the
       value of the variable investment option at the beginning of the
period, and less                                        

   (3)   a further adjustment in an appropriate amount if we ever elect to
impose a charge for our income taxes.                   

ADJUSTMENT OF UNITS AND VALUES 

We reserve the right to change the number and value of the accumulation units   
and/or annuity units credited to your contract, without notice, provided that   
strict equity is preserved and the change does not otherwise affect the         
benefits, provisions, or investment return of your contract.                    

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATING THE CALCULATION OF ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUES   
AND ANNUITY UNIT VALUES 

Assume at the beginning of the period being considered, the value of a          
particular variable investment option was $4,000,000. Investment income during  
the period totaled $2000, while capital gains were $3000 and capital losses were
$1000. Assume also that we are not imposing any tax charge. Charges against the 
beginning value of the variable investment option amount to $71.21 assuming a   
one day period. The $71.21 was computed by multiplying the beginning value of   
$4,000,000 by the factor 0.00001781. By substituting in the first formula above,
the net investment rate is equal to $3928.76 ($2000 + $3000 - $1000 - $71.21)   
divided by $4,000,000 or 0.0009822.                                             

Assume further that each accumulation unit had a value of $11.250000 on the     
previous business day, and the value of an annuity unit on such previous date   
was $1.0850000. Based upon the experience of the variable investment option     
during the period, the value of an accumulation unit at the end of the period   
would be [$11.250000 x (1 + .0009822)] or $11.261050. The value of an annuity   
unit at the end of the period would be [$1.0850000 x (1. + .0009822) x          
..99990575] or $1.085963. The final figure, .99990575, neutralizes the effect of
a 3 1/2% assumed investment rate so that the annuity unit's change in value     
reflects only the actual investment experience of the variable investment       
option.                                                                         

PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF FUND SHARES 

JHVLICO purchases and redeems fund shares for the Account at their net asset    
value without any sales or redemption charges. Each available fund issues its   
own separate series of fund shares. Each such series represents an interest in  
one of the funds of the Series Fund, which corresponds to one of our variable   
investment options. Any dividend or capital gains distributions received by the 
Account will be reinvested in shares of that same fund at their net asset value 
as of the dates paid.                                                           

On each business day, the account purchases and redeems shares of each fund for 
each variable investment option based on, among other things, the amount of     
premium payments allocated to that option, dividends reinvested, and transfers  
to, from and among investment options, all to be effected as of that date. Such 
purchases and redemptions are effective at the net asset value per Series Fund  
share for each fund determined on that same date.                               

THE ACCOUNT 

In addition to the assets attributable to contracts, the Account includes assets
derived from charges made by and, possibly, funds contributed by JHVLICO to     
commence operations of the variable investment option. From time to time these  
additional amounts may be transferred in cash by us to our general account.     
Before any such transfer, we will consider any possible adverse impact transfer 
might have on any variable investment option. The assets of one                 

7 

P-->485APOS40th Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 40th
variable investment option are not necessarily legally insulated from           
liabilities associated with another variable investment option.                 

DELAY OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS 

Ordinarily, upon a surrender or partial withdrawal, we will pay the value of any
accumulation units in a single sum within 7 days after receipt of a written     
request at our Annuity Servicing Office. However, redemption may be suspended   
and payment may be postponed under the following conditions:                    

  (1)   when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary
weekend and holiday closings;                           

(2)   when trading on that Exchange is restricted;                  

(3)   when an emergency exists as a result of which (a) disposal of 
    securities in a variable investment option is not reasonably
            practicable or (b) it is not reasonably practicable to determine the
   value of the net assets of a variable investment option; or

  (4)   when a governmental body having jurisdiction over the Account by
order permits such suspension.                          

Rules and regulations of the SEC, if any are applicable, will govern as to      
whether conditions in (2) or (3) exist.                                         

We may defer for up to 15 days the payment of any amount attributable to a      
premium payment made by check to allow the check reasonable time to clear.      

We may also defer payment of surrender proceeds payable out of any guarantee    
period for a period of up to 6 months.                                          

LIABILITY FOR TELEPHONE TRANSFERS 

If you authorize telephone transfers, you will be liable for any loss, expense  
or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent telephone or fax          
instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine, unless such loss,       
expense or cost is the result of our mistake or negligence. We employ procedures
which provide safeguards against unauthorized transactions, and which are       
reasonably designed to confirm that instructions received by telephone are      
genuine. These procedures include                                               

-     requiring personal identification,                            

-     tape recording calls, and                                     

-     providing written confirmation to the owner.                  

If we do not employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions          
communicated by telephone are genuine, we may be liable for any loss due to     
unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.                                        

VOTING PRIVILEGES 

Here's the formula we use to determine the number of Fund shares as to which you
may give instructions:                                                          

 the total value of your
 accumulation units value in a
variable investment option

divided by

 the net asset value of 1 share of
the corresponding class of the
 fund's shares

8 

P-->485APOS41st Page of 52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
At a shareholders' meeting, you may give instructions regarding:    

(1)   the election of a Board of Trustees,                          

(2)   the ratification of the selection of independent auditors,    

   (3)   the approval of a Series Fund's investment management agreements,
and                                                     

(4)   other matters requiring a vote under the 1940 Act.            

The annuitant or other payee will also be entitled to give voting instructions  
with respect to the fund shares corresponding to any variable investment option 
under which variable annuity payments are then being made. We determine the     
number of fund shares for which the payee can give instructions by dividing the 
actuarially determined present value of the payee's annuity units that          
correspond to that fund by the net asset value of one share of that fund.       

We will furnish you information and forms so that you may give voting           
instructions.                                                                   

We may own fund shares that we do not hold in any separate account whose        
participants are entitled to give voting instructions. We will vote such shares 
in proportion to the instructions we receive from all variable annuity contract 
and variable life insurance policy owners who give us instructions for that     
fund's shares (including owners who participate in separate accounts other than 
the Account).                                                                   

We have designed your voting privileges based upon our understanding of the     
requirements of the federal securities laws. If the applicable laws,            
regulations, or interpretations change to eliminate or restrict the need for    
such voting privileges, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with any  
such revised requirements.

ITEM 26. PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH DEPOSITOR OR        
REGISTRANT 

Registrant is a separate account of JHVLICO, operated as a unit investment      
trust. Registrant supports benefits payable under JHVLICO's variable annuity    
contracts by investing assets allocated to various investment options in shares 
of John Hancock Variable Series Trust I (the "Trust"), which is a "series" type 
of mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act")  
as an open-end management investment company. The Registrant and other separate 
accounts of John Hancock and JHVLICO own controlling interests of the Trust's   
outstanding shares. The purchasers of variable annuity and variable life        
insurance contracts, in connection with which the Trust is used, will have the  
opportunity to instruct John Hancock and JHVLICO with respect to the voting of  
the shares of the Series Fund held by Registrant as to certain matters. Subject 
to the voting instructions, JHVLICO directly controls Registrant.               

The Depositor is controlled by John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. ("JHFS"). A
list of persons controlled by JHFS is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 21.1

ITEM 27. NUMBER OF CONTRACT OWNERS 

Registrant had 27,078 Contract Owners as of March 1, 2004.                      

ITEM 28. INDEMNIFICATION 

Pursuant to Article X of the Company's By-Laws and Section 67 of the            
Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, the Company indemnifies each director,  
former director, officer, and former officer, and his heirs and legal           
representatives from liability incurred or imposed in connection with any legal 
action in which he may be involved by reason of any alleged act or omission as  
an officer or a director of the Company.                                        

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of  
1933 ("Securities Act") may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the
Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Commission, such        
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and 
is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification     
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses  
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant 
in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by    
such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities 
being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the 
matter has been settled by a controlling precedent, submit to a court of        
appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether indemnification by it is       
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by
the final adjudication of such issue.

Variable universal life insurance has annual fees and expenses associated with it in addition to life insurance related charges (which differ with the product chosen), including surrender charges and investment management fees. Variable universal life insurance products are long-term contracts and are sold by prospectus. They are subject to market risk due to the underlying sub-accounts, and are unsuitable as a short term savings vehicle. The primary purpose of variable universal life insurance is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person. Cash values are not guaranteed if the client is invested in the investment accounts. There are risks associated with each investment option, and the policy may lose value.

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
