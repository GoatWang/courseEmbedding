Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.[46] He also received honors from the governments of Austria,[47] including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974,[48] the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991[49] and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999[50] and Japan (Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; 24 June 1966[51]).
Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, now the Leader to Leader Institute, from 1990 through 2002.[52] In 1969 he was awarded New York University’s highest honor, its Presidential Citation.[53] For his article, "What Makes an Effective Executive", Harvard Business Review honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award — the most awarded to one person.[54] Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996.[55] He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities.[56] His 1954 book The Practice of Management was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.[57] In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed "Drucker Way" in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker's birth.[58] Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field.[59]

Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.[46] He also received honors from the governments of Austria,[47] including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974,[48] the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991[49] and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999[50] and Japan (Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; 24 June 1966[51]).
Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, now the Leader to Leader Institute, from 1990 through 2002.[52] In 1969 he was awarded New York University’s highest honor, its Presidential Citation.[53] For his article, "What Makes an Effective Executive", Harvard Business Review honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award — the most awarded to one person.[54] Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996.[55] He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities.[56] His 1954 book The Practice of Management was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.[57] In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed "Drucker Way" in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker's birth.[58] Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field.[59]

Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.[46] He also received honors from the governments of Austria,[47] including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974,[48] the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991[49] and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999[50] and Japan (Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; 24 June 1966[51]).
Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, now the Leader to Leader Institute, from 1990 through 2002.[52] In 1969 he was awarded New York University’s highest honor, its Presidential Citation.[53] For his article, "What Makes an Effective Executive", Harvard Business Review honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award — the most awarded to one person.[54] Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996.[55] He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities.[56] His 1954 book The Practice of Management was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.[57] In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed "Drucker Way" in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker's birth.[58] Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field.[59]

Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.[46] He also received honors from the governments of Austria,[47] including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974,[48] the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991[49] and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999[50] and Japan (Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; 24 June 1966[51]).
Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, now the Leader to Leader Institute, from 1990 through 2002.[52] In 1969 he was awarded New York University’s highest honor, its Presidential Citation.[53] For his article, "What Makes an Effective Executive", Harvard Business Review honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award — the most awarded to one person.[54] Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996.[55] He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities.[56] His 1954 book The Practice of Management was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.[57] In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed "Drucker Way" in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker's birth.[58] Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field.[59]

Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.[46] He also received honors from the governments of Austria,[47] including the Grand Silver Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1974,[48] the Grand Gold Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1991[49] and the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1999[50] and Japan (Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class; 24 June 1966[51]).
Drucker was the Honorary Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, now the Leader to Leader Institute, from 1990 through 2002.[52] In 1969 he was awarded New York University’s highest honor, its Presidential Citation.[53] For his article, "What Makes an Effective Executive", Harvard Business Review honored Drucker in the June 2004 with his seventh McKinsey Award — the most awarded to one person.[54] Drucker was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996.[55] He received 25 honorary doctorates from American, Belgian, Czech, English, Spanish and Swiss universities.[56] His 1954 book The Practice of Management was voted the third most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.[57] In Claremont, California, Eleventh Street between College Avenue and Dartmouth Avenue was renamed "Drucker Way" in October 2009 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Drucker's birth.[58] Drucker was posthumously honored when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field.[59]

Introduction[edit]
Drucker's books and scholarly and popular articles explored how humans are organized across the business, government, and nonprofit sectors of society.[3] He is one of the best-known and most widely influential thinkers and writers on the subject of management theory and practice. His writings have predicted many of the major developments of the late twentieth century, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan to economic world power; the decisive importance of marketing; and the emergence of the information society with its necessity of lifelong learning.[4] In 1959, Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker," and later in his life considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management.[5] Peter Drucker gave his name to three institutions: the Drucker Institute and the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management, both at Claremont Graduate University, and the Peter F. Drucker Academy.[6] The annual Global Peter Drucker Forum in his hometown of Vienna, honors his legacy.
Biography[edit]
Drucker grew up what he referred to as aVision: Reflections on the Human condition, 2016, p. 425.</ref> His mother Caroline Bondi had studied medicine and his father Adolf Drucker of Vienna-Döbling).[7] He grew up in a home where http://www.peterdrucker.at/en/bio/bio_06.html Peter F. Drucker: A Biography in Progress], p. 6, at this website</ref> He also reconnected with Doris Schmitz, an acquaintance from the University of Frankfurt, and they married in 1934.[8] The couple permanently relocated to the United States, where he became a university professor as well as a freelance writer and business consultant.
In 1943, Drucker became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He then had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as a professor of politics and philosophy at Bennington College from 1942 to 1949, then twenty-two years at New York University as a Professor of Management from 1950 to 1976.
Drucker went to California in 1971, where he developed one of the country's first executive MBA programs for working professionals at Claremont Graduate University (then known as Claremont Graduate School). From 1971 until his death, he was the Clarke Professor of Social Science and Management at Claremont.[9] Claremont Graduate University's management school was named the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management in his honor in 1987 (later renamed the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management). He established the Drucker Archives at Claremont Graduate University in 1999; the Archives became the Drucker Institute in 2006. Drucker taught his last class in 2002 at age 92. He continued to act as a consultant to businesses and nonprofit organizations well into his nineties.
Drucker died November 11, 2005 in Claremont, California of natural causes at 95.[10][11] Drucker's wife Doris died in October 2014 at the age of 103.[12]
Work and philosophy[edit]
Early influences[edit]
Among Drucker's early influences was the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, a friend of his realized that Keynes and all the brilliant economic students in the room were interested in the behavior of commodities,” Drucker wrote, “while I was interested in the behavior of people.”[13]
Over the next 70 years, Drucker’s writings would be marked by a focus on relationships among human beings, as opposed to the crunching of numbers. His books were filled with lessons on h it was often applied to him; “I have been saying for many years,” Drucker once remarked, “that we are using the word ‘guru’ only because ‘charlatan’ is too long to fit into a headline.”[14]
As a young writer, Drucker wrote two pieces — one on the conservative German philosopher Friedrich Julius Stahl and another called “The Jewish Question in Germany” — that were burned and banned by the Nazis.[4]
The 'business thinker'[edit]
Drucker's career as a business thinker took off in 1942, when his initial writings on politics and society won him access to the internal workings of General Motors (GM), one of the largest companies in the world at that time. His experiences in Europe had left him fascinated with the problem of authority. He shared his fascination with Donaldson Brown, the mastermind behind the administrative controls at GM. In 1943 Brown invited him in to conduct what might be called a "political audit": a two-year social-scientific analysis of the corporation. Drucker attended every board meeting, interviewed employees, and analyzed production and decision-making processes.
The resulting book, Concept of the Corporation, popularized GM's multidivisional structure and led to numerous articles, consulting engagements, and additional books. GM, however, was hardly thrilled with the final product. Drucker had suggested that the auto giant might want to re-examine a host of long-standing policies on customer relations, dealer relations, employee relations and more. Inside the corporation, Drucker’s counsel was viewed as hypercritical. GM's revered chairman, Alfred Sloan, was so upset about the book that he “simply treated it as if it did not exist,” Drucker later recalled, “never mentioning it and never allowing it to be mentioned in his presence.”[15]
Drucker taught that management is “a liberal art,” and he infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion.[3] He also believed strongly that all institutions, including those in the private sector, have a responsibility to the whole of society. “The fact is,” Drucker wrote in his 1973 Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, “that in modern society there is no other leadership group but managers. If the managers of our major institutions, and especially of business, do not take responsibility for the common good, no one else can or will.”[16]
Drucker was interested in the growing effect of people who worked with their minds rather than their hands. He was intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to cooperate with others in a large organization. Rather than simply glorify the phenomenon as the epitome of human progress, Drucker analyzed it, and explained how it challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run.
His approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century. By that time large corporations had developed the basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierarchies of mass production. Executives thought they knew how to run companies, and Drucker took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, lest organizations become stale. But he did so in a sympathetic way. He assumed that his readers were intelligent, rational, hardworking people of good will. If their organizations struggled, he believed it was usually because of outdated ideas, a narrow conception of problems, or internal misunderstandings.
Drucker developed an extensive consulting business built around his personal relationship with top management. He became legendary among many of post-war Japan’s new business leaders trying to rebuild their war-torn homeland. He advised the heads of General Motors, Sears, General Electric, W.R. Grace and IBM, among many others. Over time he offered his management advice to nonprofits like the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. His advice was eagerly sought by the senior executives of the Adela Investment Company, a private initiative of the world’s multinational corporations to promote investment in the developing countries of Latin America.[17]
Drucker's writings[edit]
Drucker's 39 books have been translated into more than thirty-six languages. Two are novels, one an autobiography. He is the co-author of a book on Japanese painting, and made eight series of educational films on management topics. He also penned a regular column in the Wall Street Journal for 10 years and contributed frequently to the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and The Economist.
His work is especially popular in Japan, even more so after the publication of "What If the Female Manager of a High-School Baseball Team Read Drucker’s Management", a novel that features the main character using one of his books to great effect, which was also adapted into an anime and a live action film.[18] His popularity in Japan may be compared with that of his contemporary W. Edwards Deming.[19]
Peter Drucker also wrote a book in 2001 called The Essential Drucker. It is the first volume and combination of the past sixty years of Peter Drucker's work on management. The information gathered is a collection from his previous findings, The Practice of Management (1954) to Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999), this book offers, in Drucker's words, "a coherent and fairly comprehensive introduction to management". He also answers frequently asked questions from up and coming entrepreneurs who tend to ponder the questionable outcomes of management.[9]
Key ideas[edit]
Drucker is considered the single most important thought leader in the world of management, and several ideas run through most of his writings:

Decentralization and simplification.[20] Drucker discounted the command and control model and asserted that companies work best when they are decentralized. According to Drucker, corporations tend to produce too many products, hire employees they don't need (when a better solution would be outsourcing), and expand into economic sectors that they should avoid.
The concept of "knowledge worker" in his 1959 book The Landmarks of Tomorrow.[21] Since then, knowledge-based work has become increasingly important in businesses worldwide.
The prediction of the death of the "Blue Collar" worker.[22] The changing face of the US Auto Industry is a testimony to this prediction.
The concept of what eventually came to be known as "outsourcing."[23] He used the example of "front room" and "back room" of each business: A company should be engaged in only the front room activities that are critical to supporting its core business. Back room activities should be handed over to other companies, for whom these tasks are the front room activities.
The importance of the nonprofit sector,[24] which he calls the third sector (private sector and the Government sector being the first two). Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) play crucial roles in the economies of countries around the world.
A profound skepticism of macroeconomic theory.[25] Drucker contended that economists of all schools fail to explain significant aspects of modern economies.
A lament that the sole focus of microeconomics is price, citing its lack of showing what products actually do for us,[26] thereby stimulating commercial interest in discovering how to calculate what products actually do for us; from their price.[27]
Respect for the worker. Drucker believed that employees are assets not liabilities. He taught that knowledgeable workers are the essential ingredients of the modern economy, and that a hybrid management model is the sole method of demonstrating an employee's value to the organization. Central to this philosophy is the view that people are an organization's most valuable resource, and that a manager's job is both to prepare people to perform and give them freedom to do so.[28]
A belief in what he called "the sickness of government." Drucker made nonpartisan claims that government is often unable or unwilling to provide new services that people need and/or want, though he believed that this condition is not intrinsic to the form of government. The chapter "The Sickness of Government"[29] in his book The Age of Discontinuity formed the basis of New Public Management,[30] a theory of public administration that dominated the discipline in the 1980s and 1990s.
The need for "planned abandonment." Businesses and governments have a natural human tendency to cling to "yesterday's successes" rather than seeing when they are no longer useful.[31]
A belief that taking action without thinking is the cause of every failure.
The need for community. Early in his career, Drucker predicted the "end of economic man" and advocated the creation of a "plant community"[32] where an individual's social needs could be met. He later acknowledged that the plant community never materialized, and by the 1980s, suggested that volunteering in the nonprofit sector was the key to fostering a healthy society where people found a sense of belonging and civic pride.[33]
The need to manage business by balancing a variety of needs and goals, rather than subordinating an institution to a single value.[34][35] This concept of management by objectives and self-control forms the keynote of his 1954 landmark The Practice of Management.[36]
A company's primary responsibility is to serve its customers. Profit is not the primary goal, but rather an essential condition for the company's continued existence and sustainability.[37]
A belief in the notion that great companies could stand among humankind's noblest inventions.[38]
“Do what you do best and outsource the rest” is a business tagline first “coined and developed”[39] in the 1990s by Drucker.[40] The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. Drucker began explaining the concept of outsourcing as early as 1989 in his Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article entitled “Sell the Mailroom.”[41] In 2009 by way of recognition, Drucker was posthumously inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.[42]

Criticism of Drucker's work[edit]
The Wall Street Journal researched several of his lectures in 1987 and reported that he was sometimes loose with the facts. Drucker was off the mark, for example, when he told an audience that English was the official language for all employees at Japan’s Mitsui trading company. (Drucker’s defense: “I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.”) And while he was known for his prescience, he wasn’t always correct in his forecasts. He predicted, for instance, that the nation’s financial center would shift from New York to Washington.[43]
Others maintain that one of Drucker’s core concepts—“management by objectives”—is flawed and has never really been proven to work effectively. Critic Dale Krueger said that the system is difficult to implement, and that companies often wind up overemphasizing control, as opposed to fostering creativity, to meet their goals.[44]
Drucker's classic Concept of the Corporation criticized General Motors at a time when it was, in some ways, the most successful corporation in the world. Many of GM's executives considered Drucker persona non grata for a long time afterward. Alfred P. Sloan refrained from personal hostility toward Drucker, but even Sloan considered Drucker's critiques of GM's management to be "dead wrong".[45]
Awards and honors[edit]
Drucker was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President George W.

The Wisdom of Peter Drucker from A to Z


Known widely as the father of management, Peter Drucker formulated many concepts about business that we now take for granted. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, we take a look at Drucker's contributions, from A to Z.

The Drucker Institute, Claremont Graduate University













Peter Drucker was known to gently chide ambitious acolytes to replace their pursuit of success with the pursuit of contribution. Certainly few people contributed as much to Twentieth Century business, social, and political thought as Drucker, who was born 100 years ago--on November 19, 1909--in a suburb of Vienna.


	Known widely as the father of management, Drucker immigrated to the United States in 1937. In a career that produced 39 books, as well as lectures, classes, consultations, and even movies, Drucker anatomized the functioning (and dysfunctioning) of companies. It would be easier to list the ideas he didn't promulgate in some form than those he did. (As far as we know he never weighed in on Secret Santa or pets in the workplace.) Much of the business lexicon bruited about in offices--from "knowledge worker" to "management by objective"--can be traced to Druckerian coinage. For decades harried CEOs have restructured their work lives based on Drucker's almost zen insights about efficiency and time management. His pronouncements on customers, marketing, and profitability deserve to be framed and hung in every corner office to remind business leaders where their priorities should lie.


	Encountering Drucker for the first time, readers may dismiss as obvious his observations on subjects like motivating workers and encouraging innovation. But such observations were far from obvious when Drucker first made them; and if they seem so now it is because his wisdom and clarity compelled so many companies to act as he advised. "What I find is that whenever I think I have got a really creative idea, if I go back [to] Peter's books I always find he already said it first," said One-Minute Manager author Ken Blanchard during a celebration of the centary at Claremont University's Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management. Drucker had the ears of CEOs, heads of state, and major philanthropists. Corporate titans like General Electric and Toyota were swayed by his ideas. "Drucker gave us the language, the metaphor, the lens, the understanding of the role of management as the critical function," said Good to Great author Jim Collins at the Claremont event. 


	In honor of the centenary, we have compiled an alphabetical list of some people, places, and concepts drawn from the life and works of Drucker.


Abandonment: Jim Collins earns applause when he lectures about his "stop doing" list. Jack Welch gained fame for shedding businesses in which General Electric wasn't first or second. But it was Drucker who first suggested that choosing what not to do was a decision as strategic as its opposite. Drucker's theory of "purposeful abandonment" exhorted business leaders to quickly sever projects, policies and processes that had outlived their usefulness. "The first step in a growth policy is not to decide where and how to grow," he told author Jeffrey Krames in 2003. "It is to decide what to abandon. In order to grow, a business must have a systematic policy to get rid of the outgrown, the obsolete, the unproductive."


Bystander: Though he bestrode the management world like a Colossus, Drucker was less assuming than many of today's mega-wattage gurus. An early advocate of servant leadership, he both valued and practiced humility, describing himself as a "bystander" who is "on the stage but not part of the action." Even his quasi-autobiography, Adventures of a Bystander, refracts Drucker's life through the stories of people he had known, such as Sigmund Freud and Henry Luce.


Customers: Having trouble formulating a mission statement? Let Drucker boil it down for you: "The purpose of business is to create and keep a customer," he argued. And: "What does our customer find valuable?" is the most important question companies can ask themselves. This focus helped reorient marketing away from advertising and onto a higher plane.


Decentralization: Little fish learn to be big fish in little ponds. Drucker favored decentralized organizations because they create small pools in which employees gain satisfaction by witnessing the fruits of their efforts, and nascent leaders can make mistakes without bringing down the business. When Drucker laid out these ideas in the mid-1940s, the command-and-controllers who dominated corporations were not amused. Today, of course, "stovepipe" organizations--those that remain--are widely maligned for their failure to make the most of human and information resources.


Effectiveness: Perhaps the most revelatory insight in the history of time management tore the bottom out of Frederick Taylor's time-and-motion studies: "Efficiency is doing things right," Drucker wrote in The Effective Executive. Effectiveness is doing the right things." What's true for individual managers is also true for organizations, which often squander time and resources trying to improve processes for products not worth producing. The solution? See "abandonment," above.


Future: Drucker dismissed attempts to label him a "futurist," insisting that "the best way to predict the future is to create it" and "the only thing we know about the future is that it will be different." Still, his forecasting tended to be spot-on. Among other things, he anticipated the rise of Japan, the importance of computers, and the backlash against executive pay. His method was to study significant events that had already occurred and had predictable effects going forward. Or to use Drucker's elegant oxymoron: "the future that has already happened."


General Motors: Drucker's Concept of the Corporation (1945) was arguably the first drop in what would become a deluge of organizational and management studies. The corporation in question was GM, to which Drucker was given the kind of access for which today's business scholars would sell their grandmas up the river. Drucker's conclusions about corporate structure and management style and their effect on worker productivity and morale were enormously influential--although they so annoyed then-CEO Alfred Sloan, that he pretended the book didn't exist.


Hitler: Drucker's first book, The End of Economic Man, was a study not of management but of totalitarianism. Living in Germany during Hitler's rise (two pamphlets he wrote--one praising a German-Jewish philosopher and one roundly condemning the National Socialists--were banned and burned by the Nazis), Drucker was achingly aware of the worst government and society could dish out. His later writing can be interpreted as a lifelong quest for functional, principled institutions.


Innovation: Thomas Edison would get no pushback from Drucker on his 1 percent inspiration-99-percent-perspiration formula. Drucker believed that innovation--"the specific function of entrepreneurship"--must be methodically ferreted out, and he posited seven likely places to find it: in unexpected occurrences, incongruities, process needs, new knowledge, demographics, perceptions, and changes in industries and markets. The crucial characteristic of innovators is focus. Even Thomas Edison, Drucker pointed out, "worked only in the electrical field."


Japan: The Japanese found much to love about Drucker in the 1960s, as industrial giants like Toyota embraced his theories on the primacy of employees and ideas about marketing--a comparably nascent discipline there. The admiration was mutual, with Drucker praising such Japanese practices as lifetime employment (though he later conceded the need for greater flexibility) and deliberative decision-making followed by quick action. Among Drucker's great passions was Japanese art, which he both collected and lectured on extensively.


Knowledge workers: The term "knowledge management" has that PC era smell. But almost 20 years before the founding of Microsoft, Drucker coined the term "knowledge worker" to describe the growing cadre of employees who labored with their brains rather than their hands. Drucker explained that knowledge workers require a new style of management that treats them more as volunteers or partners than as subordinates. He predicted correctly that the ability of leaders to motivate these founts of productivity--"the most valuable asset of a 21st century institution"--would become a cornerstone of competitive advantage.


Lifelong learning: Another Peter--Senge--popularized the concept of "learning organizations" in the 1980s. But learning organizations are predicated on learning individuals. Drucker called teaching people how to learn "the most pressing task" for managers, given the perpetual expansion of skills and knowledge that are products of the information economy. He personally eschewed the designation "guru"--which suggests one who counsels--casting himself rather as a student. True to form, Drucker every year assigned himself a topic about which he knew nothing and made it the subject of intense study.


Marketing: Drucker was born in 1909, the same year that Henry Ford famously declared, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black." Drucker's theories of marketing--the "distinguishing, unique function of business"--amount to an extended refutation of that attitude. The aim of marketing, in Drucker's view, was to "know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself." Innovation, which Drucker considered the other basic function of business, is responsible for the creation of those self-selling products.


Non-profits: What's better than a run on Thin Mints? Being declared the best-run organization in America by the world's preeminent business thinker. In 1981, Drucker bestowed that encomium on the Girl Scouts USA, one of many non-profits with which he worked closely over the years (others included the American Heart Association and The Salvation Army). Drucker was a passionate proponent of the social and economic importance of non-profits, which he deemed the "most distinguishing feature" of American society. He created a set of management principles specifically for that sector, and urged businesses to draw lessons in establishing a mission and motivating workers from the non-profit world. 


Objectives: In the daily scrum of business, employees become so focused on what they're doing they forget why they're doing it. And off the rails they go. In The Process of Management (1954), Drucker called this "the activity trap" and proposed "management by objective" as a way to avoid it. With MBO, employees participate in setting goals and are then evaluated on how they fulfill those goals. Managers can focus on the "what" rather than the "how." "Management by objective works--if you know the objective," Drucker wrote. "Ninety percent of the time you don't."


Profitability: Drucker was all for profit--but not for profit maximization. He viewed healthy margins as a necessary condition for the social good of wealth creation. Yet profits are not the purpose of an organization but rather a constraint: not the reason to behave in a particular way but rather a test of whether the business is behaving appropriately. "If archangels instead of businessmen sat in the directors' chairs, they would still have to be concerned with profitability, despite their total lack of interest in making profits."


Questions: In effective organizations, employees know their roles. And Drucker was acutely aware of his. "My job is to ask questions," he once informed a consulting client, according to an article in Business Week. "It's your job to provide answers." In this Socratic style, Drucker inspired a generation of business leaders to wax introspective about their organizations. Any journey of self-exploration, he believed, should begin with five essential questions. "What is our mission? Who is our customer? What does the customer value? What are our results? What is our plan?"


Respect: For more than 60 years, Drucker preached that workers are assets not liabilities, and should be treated with respect. (Pick up your Daily Dilbert or watch an episode of The Office, then judge how persuasive he was.) Drucker reimagined the organization as a human community and the job of management as preparing people to perform and then getting out of their way. That attitude wasn't just nice. Given that knowledge skills are more portable than manual ones, it was also smart. "The management of knowledge workers should be based on the assumption that the corporation needs them more than they need the corporation."


Schumpeter: Drucker really understood entrepreneurs, an appreciation spawned in part by the work of Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter introduced the idea of creative destruction: the necessary collateral damage that occurs when entrepreneurs--whom he called "wild spirits"--breach established markets. Entrepreneurs drive progress and create wealth, Schumpeter believed, a mantra Drucker took up in his own copious writings on innovation. "The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity," Drucker wrote.


Time management:"Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed."In a sense, much of Drucker's writing about effective organizations boils down to time management. If time is the insurmountable constraint, deciding how to use it becomes is the most strategic of decisions. On a more personal level, Drucker suggested managers measure how they spend their time and compare that with how they should be spending it, then make the requisite modifications. His overarching question: "What needs to be done right now for the business?"


Universals: Drucker faulted business literature for raising performance expectations unrealistically high, demanding that managers be mathematical and creative, adept at decision-making and analysis, and in possession of excellent people skills and a firm grasp of organizational dynamics. "What seems to be wanted is universal genius, and universal genius has always been in short supply," he observed. "The experience of the human race indicates strongly that the only person in abundant supply is the universal incompetent."


Vienna: Drucker grew up in a small suburb of the city named Dobling, where his parents--a government official and a doctor--hosted soirees for scientists and intellectuals. Living near the starry seat of the Hapsburg monarchy, the family was able to attract prominent economists and political philosophers like Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich August von Hayek, and Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises, whose conversation instilled in Drucker a lifelong curiosity and interest in ideas.


Welch: The chemical combustion that birthed "Neutron Jack" Welch was set off in a meeting with Drucker in 1981. Drucker posed two questions to Welch, who had just been named General Electric's CEO: "If you weren't already in this business, would you enter it today? And if not, what are you going to do about it?" Those questions inspired Welch's dramatic restructuring of General Electric, including the elimination of many low-growth businesses and 240,000 positions. From there, Welch rebuilt GE into a hugely successful, market-leading corporation with an employee-development program ambitious enough even for Drucker. 


X-ray: How do you know when it's time for the next Next New Thing? In Managing for Results (1964) Drucker introduced the concept of a "business x-ray"--a tool for determining innovation strategies. Companies use the x-ray to evaluate the life cycles of their existing offerings. They then identify the gap between those offerings' expected future performance and their own larger goals. Finally, they fill that gap with--what else?--innovation. "The entrepreneurial achievement must be large enough to fill that gap and timely enough to fill it before the old becomes obsolescent," Drucker wrote.


Yardsticks: With his emphasis on results, Drucker was bullish on metrics. But he worried that managers often measure the wrong things (for example, things unrelated to the leader's desired outcome) or that they measure too much, or that they express their measurements in the wrong way. When evaluating management effectiveness, he touted one metric (or "yardstick" as he often it) above others. That yardstick: productivity, which Drucker defined as "the degree to which resources are utilized and their yield." 


Zen: In 1998, when the writer Harriet Rubin interviewed Drucker at his home for Inc., he showed her this passage from a book on Japanese art: "The Zen-inspired painter seeks the 'truth' of a landscape, like that of religion, in sudden enlightenment. This allows no time for careful detailed draftsmanship. After long contemplation, he is expected to be able to seize inner truth in a swordlike stroke of the brush...." Similarly, Drucker achieved enlightenment through quiet observation, waiting patiently until he saw an idea whole, then rendering universal truth in the swift space of a sentence. Thus was the essence of the master.
