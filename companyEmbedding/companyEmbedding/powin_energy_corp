Battery Cells
A Brain Behind Every Battery
Battery cells are the smallest components of the BESS and contain the actual battery chemicals. Each BESS can have thousands of cells, which comprise the building blocks for the entire system. 











Battery Modules
Strength in Numbers
Modules protect a group of cells from being strained too heavily. Each module comes with a controller that balances charges across its particular selection of cells. 











Battery Packs
The Core Of Our BESS
Modules are connected together into packs to scale to a wide range of power capacities. These packed units have a dedicated controller, ensuring that the modules behind each pack work together just as efficiently as the cells inside.











Battery Strings
Scaling Energy
Once all of the cells are aggregated into modules and packs they form a complete string. Multiple battery packs make critical decisions in unison as each reports states of charge, voltage, temperature, and other critical data to the BMS. 











BESS
Battery Energy Storage System
We then take multiple strings of batteries and compile them under a unified battery management system: the Powin BESS.
The BESS software gauges the information each system element passes up the chain, making the most of every computational cycle and working together with broader energy managers with ease.











Balancing
Lasting Durability
Take comfort in knowing your system is engineered to give the most reliable performance possible, with no downtime for manual battery balancing. With specialized charging controls, the Powin BESS balances the charge of each battery in real-time, ensuring equal voltage levels across the system. 











Optimized
Protecting Your Investment
As the BESS tracks temperature, voltage, and current flowing through the cells, Powin’s custom algorithms monitor when conditions encroach warranty parameters. The system can isolate problem zones, send email notifications, and file warranty claims before damage occurs.

01
									Solar
								
Solar arrays without the support of energy storage leaves your facility vulnerable to inconsistent production. Peak production rarely coincides with peak demand, but with a Powin BESS peak production can be stored and discharged during higher demand hours. On top of managing peak production, inconsistent generation is smoothed out by the BESS to provide additional stability throughout the day. 



02
									Wind
								
Don’t leave your facility exposed to overgeneration issues as wind turbines come online. Using a Powin BESS, ramp rate is smooth and controlled, ensuring that contractual requirements are met each day. Moreover, the BESS ensures that no power is lost to curtailment or left unserved to the grid during generation lows. 



03
									For Microgrids
								
The Powin BESS gives microgrids unprecedented control over their consumption. Not only does the system provide consistency and energy resiliency, it also grants the provider the peace of mind that there will be power during emergencies and critical genset ramping events. 



04
									For Power Producers
								
Maximizing the amount of energy passing between a facility and the grid should never be dependent on the weather. Leverage your energy 100% of the time with a Powin BESS supporting your facility.

Powin Corporation Can Sell Your Product in China   Want to Enter Chinese Marketplace With Your U.S. Product? Powin Corporation's New Program Proving Successful     [05-July-2011]      TUALATIN, Ore., July 5, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Powin Corporation (OTC BB: PWON), an Oregon-based OEM and direct manufacturer of outdoor cookware products, gun safes, fitness and recreational equipment, truck parts, plastic products, renewable energy products and furniture for some of America's most well known retailers, announced today initial successes with its Channel Partner Program (CPP) that allows U.S. manufacturers to introduce and distribute their products via e-commerce channels into China's vast and fast-growing consumer marketplace.   "A U.S. cosmetics firm and a company involved in the manufacture and distribution of toys for babies has signed up for CPP," said Harry Hu, Director of CPP.  Mr. Hu, a graduate of the University of Washington, has significant experience in Information Management.   "CPP provides a low risk, high-potential option for U.S. manufacturers to enter the Chinese market and expand sale of their products.  Products are reviewed, tested and launched in less than 90 days," Mr. Hu said.   Powin's executive explains that the Company has a unique relationship with select China banks, E-Commerce and TV infomercial outlets, and mobile phone companies that allows it to showcase U.S. products to elite Chinese consumers who have the ability to buy the high quality imported products.  The CPP program will assist the U.S. manufacturer in identifying and overcoming potential language, cultural and practical barriers to marketing.  CPP also provides the U.S. manufacturer consumer feedback from selected sales channels to determine whether marketing in China makes sense for the U.S. company.   "At that point, we can develop a marketing plan for the American manufacturer and the CPP program can provide full-scale operations support in China, including warehousing, logistics, customs, compliance, order fulfillment and customer service and marketing," Mr. Hu concluded.   "We are both assisting U.S. manufacturers and bringing products to the Chinese marketplace in an efficient, effective way that consumers there desire.  This is a "win-win" for both nations," said Joseph Lu, Powin Founder, Chairman of the Board, CEO and President.

The following table presents the Company's operating expenses for its remaining business segment Powin Energy, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:   Years ended December 31, % 2016 2015 $ Change Change Operating expenses Energy $ 4,237,451 $ 4,274,597 (37,146 ) -0.9 % Total $ 4,237,451 $ 4,274,597 (37,146 ) -0.9 %  Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased approximately $37,000 or 0.9%, from $4.27 million in the same period of 2015 to $4.24 million. Decrease is primarily due to shift from product research and development on prior year to production on current year.  The following table presents the Company's net loss for its remaining business segment Powin Energy, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:   Years ended December 31, % 2016 2015 $ Change Change Net loss Energy $ 5,475,787 $ 4,347,417 1,128,370 26.0 % Total $ 5,475,787 $ 4,347,417 1,128,370 26.0 %  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had net loss of approximately $5.48 million or $0.22 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $4.35 million or $0.21 per share for the same period of 2015.  Discontinued Operations  Net sales from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreased approximately $3,702,000 or 34.2% from the same period of 2015. The decrease is due to reduce demand from Daimler Truck North America.  Operating expenses from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased approximately $71,000 or 2.6%, from $2.76 million in the same period of 2015 to $2.83 million. Increase is primarily due to write off of net intercompany AP and AR balance carried over several prior years.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, net loss from discontinued operations were approximately $1.72 million or $0.08 per share, compared to net loss of approximately $1.24 million or $0.08 per share for the same period of 2015.  2017 Outlook  In 2017, Powin Energy Corporation will turn full focus to the emerging, high growth energy storage market.  Industry experts project the energy market to grow an average of 60% per year over the next five years. During the same five-year period, the Company forecasts securing 4% - 7% of the contracts in that market. The conservative contract acquisition rate will allow the Company to grow at a manageable rate and achieve profitability. The Company will also continue to pursue strategic investment which will allow for more aggressive growth in future years.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash used in operating activities was approximately $2,918,101 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $5,825,750 used in operating activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease of cash used in operating activities is mainly due to more increase of accounts payable, and more increase in notesand other receivables, offset by more increase in net loss, more increase in prepaid expenses and deposits, more purchase of inventories.  Cash used in investing activities was approximately $3,671,299 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $304,174 used in investing activities for the same period in 2015, as the Company purchased morepropertyand equipment during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Cash provided by financing activities were approximately $4,116,917 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8,687,744 provided by financing activities for the same period in 2015. The decrease of cash provided from financing activities is due to net proceeds received from stock issuance for Energy in 2015.  The Company issued Preferred Stock in August 2015 to settle the following notes payable:   Lender Borrower Amount Number of Shares of Preferred Stock 3U Trading Co., Powin Corporation Limited $ 2,451,195 4,377,133 3U Trading Co., Powin Industries Limited S.A. DE C.V. $ 211,474 377,631 Joseph Lu Powin Corporation $ 3,333,091 5,951,947 Danny Lu Powin Corporation $ 560,565 1,001,009 Peter Lu Powin Corporation $ 560,565 1,001,009 Lu Pacific Powin Corporation Properties, LLC $ 513,574 917,097 Total $ 7,630,464 13,625,826  In August 2016, 13,625,826 shares of August 2015 preferred stock had converted into common stock.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company borrowed $2,900,100 from related parties for operating cash flows as follows:  Date of borrowing Lender Due Date Interest rate Amount October 14, 2016 Xilong Zhu March 1, 2017 0% $ 35,100 October 18, 2016 Joseph Lu January 31, 2017 6% $ 115,000 Lu Pacific October 18, 2016 Properties, LLC May 31, 2017 6% $ 50,000 Lu Pacific October 18, 2016 Properties, LLC May 31, 2017 6% $ 100,000 Lu Pacific October27, 2016 Properties, LLC October 31, 2018 7% $ 2,000,000 December30, 2016 Joseph Lu June 30, 2017 6% $ 600,000  The Company's management does not believe the current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs, including cash for working capital and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future. The Company will likely require additional cash resources that will require the Company to sell additional equity securities or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the company's stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity.  The Company's ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties including: investors' perception of, and demand for, securities of alternative manufacturing companies; conditions of the United States and other capital markets in which we may seek to raise funds; and future results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Therefore, the Company's management cannot assure that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Any failure by the Company's management to raise additional funds on terms favorable to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.  On August 8, 2014, Powin Corporation and its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Powin Energy Corporation (collectively "Powin") and SF Suntech, Inc. ("Suntech") signed a Share Subscription Agreement ("Subscription Agreement") for an investment of $25,000,000 from Suntech.  Effective April 2, 2015, Powin and Suntech signed the Fourth Supplemental Agreement ("Supplement"). Under the Supplement, the First Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement was April 2, 2015 ("First Closing") at which time Suntech made a payment to Powin in the amount of $7,450,000. That payment plus the previous payments of $3,000,000 on August 29, 2014; $2,000,000 on January 15, 2015 and $50,000 on March 2, 2015 represent a total $12,500,000 paid toward the full $25,000,000 owing under the Subscription Agreement. On April 1, 2015 and April 2, 2015, Powin Energy issued 1,765 shares and 378 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock to Suntech, respectively.  After the shares issuance, the Company owned 82.35% of Powin Energy.  The Supplement further established the Second Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement as May 31, 2015 ("Second Closing") when the balance of $12,500,000 is to be paid. If that payment is made, Powin will issue to Suntech an additional 2,143 shares of Powin Energy Common Stock. In the event Suntech is unable or unwilling to pay the remaining subscription balance, Powin will be free to sell the 2,143 shares to another purchaser for the same price per share as paid by Suntech. Suntech failed to make the required payment on May 31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company has elected to terminate the Subscription Agreement, as it pertains to the remaining $12,500,000 owing thereunder.  On January 2016, the Company paid $15,747 and bought the 15% interest in the company's Mexico subsidiary. The Company now owns 100% of the Mexico subsidiary. As of the purchase date, the non-controlling interest of Mexico amounted to $625,750. The difference of purchase price and balance of non-controlling interest is booked as additional paid in capital.  Effective October 3, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Powin Industries, SA de CV ("Powin Mexico") and Rolland Holding Company, LLC ("Rolland")pursuant to which Company sold to Rolland ninety-nine  Effective October 18, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with WeipingCai ("Cai") pursuant to which the Company sold to Cai all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock ("Shares") of Q Pacific Corporation, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, which wholly-owns and operates Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing and Q Pacific Manufacturing Corporation, the Company's second tier subsidiaries, collectively referred to as ("QPM"). In addition to the sale of the Shares, the Company also transferred and assigned to Cai the Company's right, title and interest in and to the "Huntsman" tradename held by Q Pacific Contract Manufacturing Corporation.  On October 6, 2016, the merger between Powin Corporation and Powin Energy Corporation became effective, pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and Liquidation dated, (the "Merger Agreement"). Powin Corporation is the surviving entity with a name change to Powin Energy Corporation and will continue to be traded under the stock symbol PWON.

Powin Energy to Install 6.5-MW Energy Storage in California








May 30, 2017

















































By Editors of Power Engineering
Powin Energy has entered into a contract with San Diego Gas & Electric to deliver a 6.5 MW/26 MW/h battery energy storage system in Escondido, California.
The project is subject to approval by the California Public Utilities Commission.
The proposed system will improve reliability on the existing electrical grid by optimizing the intermittent output of renewable energy sources, and allow SDG&E additional flexibility for its energy sources.
"I appreciate the confidence SDG&E has shown in Powin Energy by selecting us for this important project. We continue to find that utilities and IPPs see tremendous value in the fact we do our own engineering, software development, and manufacturing. It makes it easy for us to be adaptable to a given project's unique requirements rather than offering one-size-fits-all solutions," said Geoffrey Brown, president of Powin Energy.
CPUC has mandated SDG&E procure at least 165 MW of energy storage by 2020 and have all projects operational by 2024. To date, the utility has over 94 MW of deployed or contracted energy storage over 20 projects.
Powin Energy's Stack140 is a modular, purpose-built 140 kWh battery array that scales from 125 kW to multiple megawatt applications. It is available in both indoor and NEMA 3R outdoor models, each of which is engineered to maximize energy density and minimize system footprint. [Native Advertisement]
