Teledyne Technologies Incorporated Key Developments

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended April 02, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter of 2017; Revises Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
May 4 17
Teledyne Technologies Incorporated reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended April 02, 2017. Teledyne reported first quarter 2017 sales of $566.1 million, compared with sales of $530.5 million for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.7%. Net income was $30.5 million or $0.84 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017, compared with $39.0 million or $1.11 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 21.8%. Operating income was $58.1 million against $60.9 million reported last year. Income before income taxes was $40.6 million against $53.9 million reported last year. Adjusted operating income was $71.0 million or $1.26 per diluted share against $60.9 million or $1.11 per diluted share reported last year. Cash provided by operating activities was $53.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared with $69.1 million reported last year. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $12.6 million compared with $14.2 million reported last year. While cash flow declined from last year, it was, nevertheless, the second-highest level for any Teledyne first quarter. The lower cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 primarily reflected the impact of transaction-related expense payments for the e2v acquisition and the timing of accounts receivable collections. The company ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion of net debt, that is approximately $1.31 billion of debt and capital leases less cash of $69.7 million or a net debt to capital ratio 43.7%.

Based on its current outlook, the company’s management believes that second quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25. The company’s management believes that second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.27 to $1.32.

Based on its current outlook, the company’s management expects full year 2017 GAAP earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $5.20 to $5.30. The company’s management believes that full year 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $5.76 to $5.86, compared to the prior outlook of $5.40 to $5.50, which excluded e2v. The company’s effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to be 28.3%, before discrete items.
