Strategy



Fundamental Long/Short Equity Strategy
We believe applying fundamental research with a focus on smaller capitalization stocks uncovers unique long and short investments. Businesses that are less diversified are inherently more affected by the drivers that create or destroy equity value over the investment cycle. We have identified what we believe are the most important of these drivers as the strength or weakness of the business model itself, the pedigree of the fiduciaries, and the advantages or challenges created by the company’s financial structure. We look for these qualities and construct the portfolio within a three category framework. The first category is comprised of equities which have company-specific catalysts that we expect to generate returns largely independent of the overall market. The second category is investing behind themes that we believe will drive excess returns over time. Third, we have a portion of the portfolio that is expected to be driven by cyclical aspects of particular industries. We generally concentrate our positions in 40 longs and 40 shorts to maximize the value of our research and convictions, and likewise do not utilize ETFs. To manage risk, we avoid leverage, invest across a broad set of industries, and remain disciplined with our price targets and stop losses.Read more >

	Resolution Property buys McArthurGlen Roubaix from Henderson's European Outlet Mall Fund for €23m
Change siteSecurityLegalSign inCreate a profileRegister to receive email updates: Receive tailored notifications from the fund managers, funds, asset classes and topics relevant to you.Resolution Property buys McArthurGlen Roubaix from Henderson's European Outlet Mall Fund for €23m26/08/2011DownloadResolution Property has acquired McArthurGlen Roubaix, an outlet centre near Lille in France managed by McArthurGlen Designer Outlets, from the €1.5 billion European Outlet Mall Fund (EOMF), managed by Henderson Global Investors, for €23m. The purchase, on behalf of the Resolution Real Estate Fund III L.P, represents a net initial yield of 8%. Located in Roubaix, part of France’s fourth largest metropolitan conurbation, only 10 km from Lille, the centre spans 17,325 sq m of retail space, comprising 75 units. It offers a comprehensive tenant mix, including international fashion brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Gaastra and Lacoste, among many others.  Peter Todd, Director at Resolution Property, said: “This will be our second designer outlet village in France, following our purchase of McArthurGlen Troyes last year, also from EOMF. McArthurGlen Roubaix is a well-located centre offering some excellent asset management opportunities that are firmly in line with Resolution’s value-add strategy. It is an opportunity to extend our successful partnership with McArthurGlen and further our investment in Outlet Centres, where sales growth continues to outperform full price retail.” McArthurGlen Roubaix is located in the city centre, between two major axial roads - Boulevard Général Leclerc and Boulevard Gambetta. Developed by McArthurGlen in 1999, with its signature architectural outlet village design, it formed part of a major urban revitalisation project in Roubaix’s city centre. This was undertaken by the local municipalities, aimed at improving the city’s image and attracting residents that work in the nearby business hub of Lille.  Resolution’s active asset management strategy will target additional international brands to achieve full leasing of the centre, which has a current vacancy rate of 6%. Talks are already underway with several top retailers. The centre is held on a long lease from the local authority and talks are well advanced to privatise management of the public realm to enable significant improvements to the retail and leisure experience. Resolution will also discuss the acquisition of the freehold in the longer term.  David Williams, Fund Manager for Henderson’s European Outlet Mall Fund, added: “The sale of Roubaix by Henderson's EOMF has proved that good quality designer outlets are attractive to the international investment community as a whole. Since the acquisition of McArthurGlen Roubaix by EOMF in 2004, Henderson and McArthurGlen ,working in partnership, have improved the brand mix, and the overall customer experience to deliver strong returns for investors.” McArthurGlen, who opened their 20th Designer Outlet, McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Athens, in Greece on 2 June of this year, will retain their management role at McArthurGlen Roubaix, working in partnership with Resolution Property. McArthurGlen continue to see strong growth in their designer outlet model. There are plans underway to open a further three centres in Europe; one in Neumunster near Hamburg in 2012 (in partnership with Henderson’s EOMF) and two in France (one west of Paris near Vernon in 2014 and the other in Miramas southern France) in 2015. Julia Calabrese, CEO of McArthurGlen, says: “We are pleased to further our relationship with Resolution Property, and work in partnership with them to strengthen the proposition and unique tenant mix at McArthurGlen Roubaix. Designer outlet retailing is an exciting sector that continues to perform well in the current economic climate, perpetually bucking the retail market trends. We look forward to McArthurGlen Roubaix’s further success over the coming years.”    Jones Lang LaSalle acted on behalf of Resolution Property while the EOMF, managed by Henderson Global Investors, was represented by Cushman&Wakefield. Herbert Smith France were Resolution’s lawyers and Linklaters France advised Henderson’s EOMF. - ENDS Press enquiries Henderson Global Investors     Gemma Bradley, Media Relations Manager, Property   T: +44 (0)20 7818 4441E: gemma.bradley@henderson.com Henderson Press Office  T: +44 (0) 20 7818 4222E: pressoffice@henderson.com  ShareRelated fundsRelated articlesPension Insurance Corporation appoints Hender...2 years agoGlobal dividends reached a new record in 2014...2 years agoHenderson to merge European long/short strate...2 years agoMoreClassificationsImportant message
