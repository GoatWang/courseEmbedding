REPRESENTATIVE CASES
Over the last few years, Mr. Davis has established an impressive record as lead counsel on many patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, unfair competition, false advertising, and other intellectual property-related cases. Cases on which he acted as counsel include the following (client represented is underlined):

D Three Enterprises, LLC v. SunModo Corporation, No. 1:15-cv-01151-CBS, 2017 WL 1023389 (D. Colo. March 15, 2017): Led defense team, successfully arguing for invalidity of 30+ asserted claims across three patents related to roof mount assemblies that can be used for solar panels. Won summary judgment of invalidity for SunModo pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §§ 112 and 120 because the asserted claims were not entitled to the earliest possible effective filing date of a provisional patent application.
Capsugel Belgium NV et al. v. Bright Pharma Caps, Inc. et al., No. 3:15-cv-321-PK (D. Or.): Successfully asserted two patents and false advertising claims relating to pullulan-based capsules. Defended parallel PTAB challenges to the asserted patents. Obtained permanent injunction for patent owner Capsugel against all four defendants, including the manufacturer in China, barring infringing sales of pullulan capsules in the United States. Defendants further agreed not to sell any of the capsules at issue in Canada or non-organic pullulan capsules in countries in Europe where Capsugel also has patent protection. Prosecuted a novel false advertising claim between competitors, asserting misuse of the term “organic” and the USDA organic seal in connection with capsules containing the synthetic chemical SLS. Defendants agreed to settle on the day set for a hearing on Capsugel’s motion for summary judgment.
TQP Dev., LLC, Nos. 2:12-cv-61, 2:12-cv-180, 2:12-cv-570, 2:13-cv-219 (E.D. Tex., Fed. Cir.): Led defense team concurrently representing up to nine clients, including Adobe, British Airways, Costco, Intuit, LinkedIn, Travelocity.com, Twitter, Yelp, and Zones. TQP asserted a patent relating to encryption against the ubiquitous use of RC4 with SSL/TLS with websites. Won summary judgment of non-infringement after hundreds of companies had been sued, more than 139 had settled for a total more than $45 million, and one company (not represented by Klarquist) had lost at trial. See TQP Dev., LLC v. Intuit Inc., No. 2:12-cv-180-WCB, 2014 WL 2810016 (E.D. Tex. Jun. 20, 2014).
Taylor Brands, LLC v. Columbia River Knife & Tool, No. 2:08-cv-325 (E.D. Tenn.): Led defense team and won summary judgment of non-infringement for CRKT in patent case involving assisted opening knives. Successfully defended judgment on appeal. See 2011 WL 3236072 (Fed. Cir. July 28, 2011) (affirming without opinion).
Danner, Inc. v. Foley & Lardner, LLP, No. 09-cv-1220-JE, 2010 WL 2608294 (D. Or.): Team obtained remand of legal malpractice case to prosecute the action in Oregon state court. After prevailing against three summary judgment motions filed by the defense, the case settled.
Grasshopper House, LLC v. Accelerated Recovery Centers, Renaissance Malibu Foundation et al., No. 3:09-cv-778-HA (D. Or.): Assumed the role of lead counsel less than 48 hours prior to a show cause hearing and defended against contempt allegations, convincing the Court to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction and vacate its default judgment and injunction.
MEI, LLC v. Integral Applied Technology, Inc. et al., No. 6:08-cv-6046-AA, 2009 WL 2871125 (D. Or.): Obtained a complete summary judgment victory in a case involving copyright infringement and violations of the DMCA and Lanham Act relating to MEI’s software.
Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. v. Beaird Company, Ltd. et al., No. 3:07-cv-1651-PK (D. Or.): Defeated motion to dismiss or transfer the litigation to the declaratory-judgment-defendant’s home forum. The case thereafter settled favorably for our client.
Boydstun Metal Works, Inc. v. Cottrell, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 2d 1119 (D. Or.): Team defeated motion for summary judgment asserting invalidity and won cross motion for summary judgment, eliminating adversary’s lead defense that it had allegedly offered for sale before the critical date its screw actuator technology for auto transporters. The case thereafter settled favorably for our client.
CollegeNET, Inc. v. ApplyYourself, Inc., Lead No. 02-cv-484-HU (D. Or.) and 418 F.3d 1225 (Fed. Cir.): A leading member of team that won and upheld on appeal a jury verdict finding infringement of CollegeNET’s patented online application system and form technology.

Derrick W. ToddyOf Counsel
PRACTICE AREA OVERVIEW
Since joining Klarquist in 2006, Mr. Toddy has focused his practice on all aspects of Intellectual Property disputes, from pre-litigation and “alternatives to litigation” such as PTO reexaminations and other post-grant proceedings, through discovery, motion practice and summary judgment, to preparation for trial, as well as related settlement and licensing work. Mr. Toddy has particular experience litigating patents involving computer software, computer hardware, video game technology and e-commerce applications. He has represented technology clients such as Microsoft, SAP, eBay, Adobe, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, and Amazon.com, as well as retail clients such as Office Depot, Staples, J.C. Penney, Burlington Coat Factory, Dillard’s and Costco in patent, trademark and trade secret disputes nationwide, including in California, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, Puerto Rico, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.
Mr. Toddy also has experience in advising clients regarding crafting settlement agreements and intellectual property licensing issues, and has prepared a number of opinions regarding both non-infringement and invalidity. Finally, Mr. Toddy has extensive experience working on various post-grant proceedings in the USPTO, and has played an integral role in successfully appealing or defending appeals to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (formerly BPAI). Mr. Toddy’s work on these reexams and appeals often resulted in cancellation of patent claims asserted in litigation for which Klarquist’s clients had obtained a stay pending the outcome of ex parte or inter partes reexams, in many cases avoiding entirely or greatly reducing the cost of having to litigate these claims in district court.
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE
Mr. Toddy’s practice emphasizes computer- and mechanical-related fields, and in particular the field of Web commerce.

John D. VandenbergPartner
PRACTICE AREA OVERVIEW
For 33 years, Mr. Vandenberg has been litigating patents around the country for technology clients including Microsoft, SAP, eBay, Nautilus, and Mentor Graphics.
Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals: Mr. Vandenberg has argued a dozen appeals before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. He successfully argued before the Supreme Court of the United States in Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., No. 13-369, for rejection of the Federal Circuit’s “insolubly ambiguous” and “amenable to construction” test for enforcing the Patent Act’s mandate that patent claims “particularly point[] out and distinctly claim[]” the patent’s invention.
Court Trials: Mr. Vandenberg has first-chair tried patent infringement suits, copyright infringement suits, trademark infringement suits, and product-configuration trade dress suits. Most recently, he and a team at Klarquist obtained an $8.42 Million jury verdict in a false advertising action.
PTAB Trials: Mr. Vandenberg has been lead counsel in Patent Office trial proceedings.
Patent-Law Training and Advocacy: Since 2004, Mr. Vandenberg has been the primary editor of an extensive summary of substantive defenses and related strategies in patent infringement suits, posted at www.patentdefenses.com. He speaks throughout the nation on patent law, district-court patent litigation, PTAB patent trials, and patent appellate practice. He emphasizes untraditional approaches to successfully defending against a patent infringement suit while improving the law and patent system in the process. To the same end, he has authored many Amici briefs in the U.S. Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit on behalf of scores of technology companies and associations.
