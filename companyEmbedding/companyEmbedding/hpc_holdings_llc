Data Holdings Selects Datacenter Switching Products From Extreme Networks
March 2, 2015


SAN JOSE, Calif., March 2 — Extreme Networks, Inc., a leader in high performance networking, and Data Holdings, LLC, today announced a successful implementation of Ethernet services for Wisconsin’s premier Tier III enhanced data center. Located in the city of Milwaukee, Data Holdings is a wholesale and retail colocation services provider offering its customers physical layer infrastructure services.
Data Holdings chose Extreme Networks’ data center switching products when building its new LEED Gold greenfield data center. Through managed services provider Stack41, additional Extreme Networks switching, software services and support have been provided to create a resilient, responsive and easily managed network. By utilizing Extreme’s Summit X460 series fixed switches and BlackDiamond X8 modular switches, Data Holdings is able to deploy carrier connectivity for its customers’ applications in an efficient and highly scalable manner.
“When considering our IT requirements and the needs of our customers, it was important to decide on an Ethernet vendor that could provide scalability, fast recovery and a network supporting both virtual private LAN services (VPLS) and Ethernet automatic protection switching (EAPS),” said Stacy England, Vice President, Data Center Operations, Data Holdings. “Extreme Networks’ core and access switching edge solutions matched up very well with our needs and the local Extreme support team has been crucial to the success of the entire process, as their efforts and expertise supports the business.”
“Extreme Networks is committed to providing best-in-class architecture to meet the demands of application availability and the evolving needs of today’s data centers – from server and storage virtualization to network visualization,” said Markus Nispel, vice president Solutions Architecture and Innovation for Extreme Networks.  “We’ve designed our solutions to meet business requirements including improvement of application performance, regulatory compliance and IT agility. Our work with Data Holdings is a great example of how this technology can be used to solve real world data center problems.”
Extreme Networks’ Data Center Switching Products

Summit X460-G2 Series – Intelligent access and “Top of Rack” switches providing high density Gigabit Ethernet connectivity to support emerging demands for server and storage convergence and voice/data services.
BlackDiamond X8 – Modular switch platform designed for cloud-scale requirements of data centers, high-performance computing (HPC) and Internet exchange points (IXP), the BlackDiamond X8 provides a low-latency, high-performance switch fabric with high-density wire-speed connectivity from 10Gbps to 100Gbps.
