YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→NamesLeading the Way at a Company Called ExperianInformation services: David van Diest Skilling ran TRW's credit bureau, and now he has ambitious plans for the independent outfit that's succeeding it.September 22, 1996|JOHN O'DELL | TIMES STAFF WRITER


When the big red TRW sign is lowered from its perch atop an Orange County high-rise in coming weeks, it will symbolize the huge changes occurring at a company that touches virtually every consumer with a credit card or loan--TRW Information Systems & Services.The company that helped create the credit information business launched a $300-million bond sale, broke away from its Cleveland-based parent and struck out on its own under a new name, Experian--all last week.Leading the most ambitious change in the company's 27-year history is a courtly white-haired executive who, in the words of one admirer, looks like a buttoned-down corporate manager but thinks like a freewheeling entrepreneur.At 63, David van Diest Skilling--he prefers to be called Van--had two years to go before a forced retirement from TRW. But he was not about to go quietly.A loyal company man to the outside world, he argued inside the corporation that the unit he ran was misunderstood and underutilized--a sales-and-marketing outfit awkwardly grafted onto a company run by engineers who were rooted in the manufacturing world.Play me or trade me, Skilling urged, seeking a pledge from TRW to either let Information Systems use its cash to grow or sell the unit that last year earned $52 million on revenue of $540 million.The campaign paid off. Earlier this year, TRW sold an 80% stake in the information unit for $1 billion to an investment group that includes Skilling and most of the unit's top managers. In a move industry analysts see as a vote of confidence in the new business, TRW retains a 19.6% stake in Experian.Skilling, general manager of Orange-based Information Systems since 1989, now is chairman and chief executive of Experian, and he's free of the corporate strictures he felt were holding him back."I can't imagine a more exciting opportunity for all of us," he says.The transformation of TRW Information Systems is likely to excite more than its employees, though. The company has ambitious plans to go worldwide with existing services and an array of new products.Citing competitive reasons, Skilling declines to discuss new products his company is developing. But they most certainly will give customers faster access to detailed information about millions of people. They'll make credit checks quicker and more accurate, the kind of service that already enables department stores to offer customers instant credit approval, for example. And they'll provide refined marketing data so mailing lists can be tailored to increasingly specific audiences.This will probably loosen a bonanza of data to be gobbled up by information-hungry businesses. There'll be more opportunities for prospective landlords, employers, lenders and marketers to obtain information on consumers' personal assets and credit histories. And more catalogs, credit card applications and targeted advertising will be piling up in the daily mail.Industry insiders say Experian has a powerful new tool--a $70-million high-tech system that can pull data from its files on 190 million people and 12 million businesses and produce customized packages of information with far more accuracy and speed than has been possible before.Want a mailing list of high-income Santa Monica residents who own vacation homes, like boats and are likely to pay their debts? No problem.The data-gathering blitz is likely to intensify as big rivals such as Equifax Inc., Trans Union Corp. and Dun & Bradstreet introduce an array of new products to protect their territories."We're all a little bit wary," admits Harry Gambill, president and chief executive of Chicago-based Trans Union. "This means the business can only become more competitive."That has one major consumer group on edge. The likelihood that there soon will be a flood of new information products on the market "definitely heightens our concerns" about personal privacy and accurate credit reports, says Pamela Pressley, a consumer advocate with the California Public Interest Research Group in Los Angeles.Some observers expect Skilling and his financial backers, Boston investment funds Bain Capital Inc. and Thomas H. Lee Co. also will make an aggressive effort to snap up other companies."There's a lot of consolidation going on in the information industry," says John Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners in Century City. "You get maximum leverage by finding new markets, and the quickest way is to buy up smaller companies that are serving those markets."TRW Information itself was the product of an acquisition. In 1969, Aerospace giant TRW bought Credit Data Corp., a Michigan-based credit reporting business that was one of the first in the industry to computerize.The unit grew rapidly. But that came at a price.When Skilling took over seven years ago, the operation consisted of a batch of barely related business units with no focus, a top-heavy management structure and a payroll burdened by too many people doing the same jobs.1 | 2 |  Next

Skilling’s Laws


			Posted on March 1, 1999
                by Chief Marketer Staff




VAN SKILLING HAS engineered some major deals, and is good at playing the role of a buttoned-down CEO. But he has another side-that of a character in the American grain.
Part of it has to do with the sheer length and variety of his career. A native of St. Louis, David van Diest Skilling (known to all as Van) got out of college at the tail end of the Korean War.
“I had a major in chemistry with the idea that I was going to be a doctor,” he said during a chat in San Francisco last fall. “I was not sure I wanted to go to medical school, but since I didn’t want to be drafted, I became an oxymoron-a naval intelligence officer.”
In 1970, having bounced from a boat business to a chemicals firm, and from Denver to Los Angeles, he received an offer that would define his career.
“A friend of mine from Navy days said, ‘I have an idea.’ I thought he wanted to open a laundromat. Why don’t I work for TRW? I said, ‘You don’t pay your bills very well.'”
TRW was a large defense contractor and engineering concern, and Skilling worked in its oil-field equipment and industrial products groups, in both marketing and operations-whatever they threw him. In 1989 he was given command of the information services unit, consisting of a credit bureau and database business, about which he knew little.
But he was a quick study, and realized at once that the unit had to overhaul its outdated systems. He also figured out that TRW brass had never been comfortable with the information business, and he told them “Play me or trade me.”
They did, in a $1.1 billion deal backed by Bain Capital and Thomas Lee Associates. The unit was renamed Experian. That was just the start.
As part of a two-pronged strategy to be more global and get more involved in target marketing, Experian made an offer to buy CCN, a British targeting company owned by Great Universal Stores. But it didn’t work out as planned.
“We went from being the groom to the bride,” Skilling laughed. Experian was acquired by CCN/GUS, then went on an acquisition bender of its own, buying Metromail and Direct Marketing Technology, among other things. Today Experian is a true global enterprise-thanks in large part to the tall, silver-haired executive described by some as courtly.
Skilling’s subordinates can be forgiven for being misty eyed over his retirement, which is scheduled for March 1. Never one to take himself too seriously, he often amused them by reciting Skilling’s Laws, such as “Clear liquor before dinner, red wine with dinner, brown liquor after dinner.”
Though he’ll stay active, Skilling hopes to to do some fly fishing and spend more time with his family. Memories? To this day, he is proud of one of the bright kids on his team. “The only job Bill Gates ever had was working for me,” he said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t keep him.”
