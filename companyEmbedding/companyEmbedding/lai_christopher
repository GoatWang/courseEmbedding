Christopher Morrison, Mortgage Broker
 Christopher brings more than 19 years experience as both as a Financial Advisor then as a Mortgage Underwriter for a major Canadian bank to our office in the heart of Vancouver.
“I’m excited to join Verico as a newly independent Mortgage Broker! One of the biggest differences for me is that now I am working on your behalf and relying on my expertise to shop around your specific mortgage needs. I am working with Verico, Canada’s largest association of independent brokers, which means I can access more than 40 lenders instead of just one bank.”
That’s going to be awesome –  it means you get access to the lowest rates in Canada, and more options than I could ever offer you from a bank.
Becoming a mortgage broker was a natural progression given Christopher’s love of helping people and an affinity for economics and numbers. He grew up in Coquitlam and now lives and works in Vancouver. He spends time out of the office enjoying the company of family and friends, traveling and playing ice/roller hockey.
Buying a home or refinancing your mortgage is an important decision. More than just rates, as your broker, Christopher knows about lending options, payment alternatives and the importance of excellent service.

This could not be further from the truth.  On February 21, 2014 I fell at home breaking my left ankle and right leg.  That evening I met Dr. Lai before he operated on my legs.  I could not be more pleased with the care that I have received during this very trying time.  He is very personable and is more that willing to answer questions and to explain just what he is doing and intends to do in caring for you.Following a two week hospitalization in the Valley, I was moved to a rehab facility in La Mesa where I spent five weeks.  There I was told by a doctor that I had received excellent care in the Valley and that the claims about bad health care were wrong.  He went on to say that there are a number of doctors in major retirement cities, like San Diego, that had come to the area to retire and then signed on with a hospital or a practice to keep a hand in it but have not kept up their skills.You will not hear me capping on the doctors that I currently see in the Imperial Valley.Zadeh Hamid MDobgynbrawley13 ratedJo Calex, Dr Zadeh and staff have checked the records and don’t have a patient with your name.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon.

Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Chris provided me and my wife an excellent first time home buying experience. He went above and beyond to provide us with the necessary information and guidance. He was very polite and did his best to accommodate our interests. We would absolutely recommend Chris to anyone looking to buy a home.        Highly likely to recommend     03/21/2017 -  oneluckycolleen    Written about  Christopher Lai   on 03/21/2017 Bought a Single Family home in 2017 for approximately $350K in Tampa, FL.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  We lucked out when we contacted Chris Lai regarding a property for sale.  Previously we had worked with two separate realtors who were not responsive to our communications or proactive in helping us in our home search.  Chris sent us daily emails with potential homes, moved quickly to schedule  viewings, and we found our dream home within weeks of meeting him.  He had referrals for everything from lenders who would close quickly to contractors to assist in getting our new home move in ready.  Chris has expert knowledge of the surrounding area and will be there for you every step of the way.  This is the third home purchase we've made and he is by far the best realtor we've worked with.  It's amazing what the right realtor can do!  Highly recommend.More Less         Highly likely to recommend     03/21/2017 -  SWALKER588    Written about  Christopher Lai   on 03/21/2017 Bought and sold a home in 2017 in Wyatt Street Citizen Advisory Committee, Largo, FL 33756.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Chris, handled the sell of our home as well as the purchase of our new home.  Working through the process of two properties can be rather stressful and even though I am in the industry myself we would have been lost without him.  He was always responsive, knowledgeable and professional.  Chris  alleviated a lot of the pressure on my husband and I by being so involved and available.  He answered all of our questions along the way and provided fantastic recommendations for photographers, inspectors, brokers, movers, etc. that were all wonderful to work with.  Chris played a large role in both transactions moving forward seamlessly without any hiccups or delays.  I would absolutely recommend his services to our friends and family and appreciate all of his hard work and dedication to getting the deals done!More Less         Highly likely to recommend     03/16/2017 -  Serena carver    Written about  Christopher Lai   on 03/16/2017 Bought a Single Family home in 2017 for approximately $175K in Valrico, FL.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  One thing I believe for sure is the saying "things happen for a reason." I believe that Chris Lai was meant to be our guide in purchasing our first home. Chris was amazing from the start. He is really informative and helped us find a home that's perfect for our family. He answered every question we  had and made us feel thankful to have a realtor like Chris. Everyone will say their realtor is great and of course that is true, but Our realtor is greatest! Chris made sure we found a home in timely manner. He was quick to respond and act when we needed him. Being a first time home buyer We can say Chris really made this process possible and we closed in about 30 days. I highly recommend Chris to all my friends and clientele. I thank you Chris and if we ever need to buy or sell a home in the future I'll be calling Chris.More Less         Highly likely to recommend     12/02/2016 -  zuser20160922083804347    Written about  Christopher Lai   on 12/02/2016 Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $600K in Tampa, FL.

Hello, my name is Christopher Lai and I have been a Realtor for over 10 years in the Tampa Bay Area.  My roots are from Southern California and the Midwest but I have called Tampa home since 1993 after graduating from the University of Missouri.  Before becoming a full time Realtor, I was in sales, marketing, and customer service for over a decade in the consumer products, software, and financial services industries.  I believe my corporate background along with my passion for real estate has enabled me to have a successful real estate career, and I promise you will notice a difference when you work with me to either buy or sell your home.  Having a father that is a builder and a mother that was an interior decorator, has given me additional perspective and understanding of what buyers and sellers go through during a real estate transaction.  My goal is to utilize my experience and local knowledge for you during the home buying or selling process.  I look forward to servicing your real estate needs in the Tampa Bay Area.
