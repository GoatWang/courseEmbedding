NEW YORK, Jan. 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- FinTech Acquisition Corp. II (NASDAQ:  FNTEU) (the "Company"), a blank-check company formed for the purpose of acquiring or merging with one or more businesses or entities in the financial technology industry, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 15,300,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, for gross proceeds to the Company of $153,000,000. The Company's units will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "FNTEU" and will begin trading on January 20, 2017. Each unit issued in the offering consists of one share of the Company's common stock and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The closing of the offering is anticipated to take place on or about January 25, 2017.








Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is serving as the sole book-running manager and Northland Capital Markets as co-manager for the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,295,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.
A registration statement relating to the units and the underlying securities was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2017. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
This offering was made my means of a prospectus, copies of which may be obtained for free by visiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website at http://www.sec.gov. Alternatively, a copy of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. at 499 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Attn: Kevin Brennan, kbrennan@cantor.com, 212-915-1970.
This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," including with respect to the initial public offering. No assurance can be given that such offering will be completed on the terms described, or at all. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.

We are offering 15,300,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the placement units (of which $153.0 million will be
deposited into the trust account) will be used as set forth in the following
table.

                                                                           Overallotment

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $231,846 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of loans made to us by our sponsor. These loans by our 
    sponsor will be repaid upon the earlier of the completion of this offering
    or June 30, 2017. If offering expenses actually paid are less than the 
    estimates set forth in this table, the balance will be used for post-closing
    working capital.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer until consummation of our initial 
    business combination $7.65 million of their underwriting commissions (or 
    approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is 
    exercised in full), which equals 5.0% of the gross proceeds from the units
    sold to the public, excluding any units purchased pursuant to the 
    underwriters’ overallotment option, and 7.0% of the gross proceeds from the
    units sold to the public pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option.
    Upon consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.

(3) $153.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($175.95 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in
    full), including deferred underwriting commissions of $7.65 million 
    (approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters exercise their 
    overallotment option in full), will be placed in a trust account held at 
    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in the United States, with Continental 
    Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated 
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. We are also
    entitled to pay our franchise and income taxes, up to $500,000 of working 
    capital expenses and up to $100,000 of dissolution expenses from interest 
    earned on the trust account.

(5) To the extent that we need working capital in excess of the net proceeds 
    from this offering and the private placement held out of trust and the 
    amounts of interest available to us from the trust account, our sponsor has
    committed to lend us the necessary funds, up to a maximum of $1,100,000. The
    loans will be interest free, due and payable upon completion of our initial 
    business combination and convertible into warrants of the post business 
    combination entity at a price of $0.75 per one-half of one warrant at the 
    option of the lender.

A total of $153.0 million (or $175.95 million if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from
this offering and the private placement, including $7.65 million (or
approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full) of the deferred underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act. Except for any interest income released to us to pay our franchise
and income taxes and up to $500,000 for working capital purposes, none of the
funds held in the trust account will be released, subject to the requirements of
law, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account
and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the
expiration of the 24 month period (our board of directors may determine to
liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its
business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify
an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and
legal requirements to consummate a business combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we do not
use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the 
purchase price in connection with our business combination, we may use the 
remaining cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust, interest income on the amount in the trust account that may
be released to fund working capital requirements and amounts which our sponsor
has committed to lend to us for working capital prior to our initial business
combination will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our
initial business combination. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending
on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Our sponsor, FinTech Investor Holdings II, LLC, has committed to loan us up to
an aggregate of $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering ($231,846 of which has been loaned as of the date of this prospectus).
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of June
30, 2017 or the completion of this offering. In addition, in order to fund
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor has committed to loan us funds as may be required up to a maximum of
$1,100,000, which will be repaid only upon the consummation of an initial
business combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination,
we may use a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to
repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds from the trust account may be
used for such repayment, other than up to $500,000 of interest income earned
thereon. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts, the unpaid
amounts would be forgiven. Any part or all of such loans may be converted into
additional warrants at $0.75 per one-half of one warrant (warrants to purchase a
maximum of 733,333 whole shares if the full $1,100,000 is loaned and that amount
is converted into warrants) of the post-business combination entity at the
option of our sponsor. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants
issued to our sponsor.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial holders, directors, officers or their
respective affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our
initial business combination, although as of the date of this prospectus (apart
from the purchase of the placement units) they have no commitments, plans or
intentions to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we
anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our
securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption
of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in
direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders
approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There
is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not
disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under
the Exchange Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule
10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying
any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the
price they may pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such
holders with incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an
initial business combination. We will notify stockholders of such material
purchases or arrangements that would affect the vote on an initial business
combination, if any, by press release, filing a Form 8-K or by means of a
supplement to our proxy statement. No funds in the trust account may be used to
effect purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions.
                   
In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount
of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would
cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,000, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the
trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination
prior to the expiration of the 24 month period (our board of directors may
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining
time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a
business combination). In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

The initial holders and Cantor Fitzgerald have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i) in
connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of
the underwriters’ overallotment option) and (iii) if we fail to consummate a
business combination within the 24 month period or if we liquidate prior to the
expiration of the 24 month period. The initial holders have also agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the
consummation of a business combination or a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the 24 month period. However,
if the initial holders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates,
acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect
to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
or liquidate within the required time period. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald
will have the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with respect to any
public shares it acquires. Cantor Fitzgerald has informed us that it has no
current commitments, plans or intentions to acquire any public shares for its
own account; however, if Cantor Fitzgerald does acquire public shares, it will
do so in the ordinary course of its business. Cantor Fitzgerald will not make 
any such purchases when it is in possession of any material nonpublic 
information not disclosed to the seller, during a  restricted period under
Regulation M under the Exchange Act, in transactions that would violate Section
9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act, or if prohibited by applicable 
state securities laws or broker-dealer regulations.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our
public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the
resources available to us for an initial business combination. In addition, the
number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially
represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of
these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed in May 2015 that will seek to effect a
merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or
assets, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial


 business
combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities
and activities relating to this offering. We have not identified any acquisition
target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any discussions,
directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any acquisition target. We
have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate
operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business
combination.

We currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses
providing technological services to the financial services industry, with
particular emphasis on businesses that provide data processing, storage and
transmission services, data bases and payment processing services. We are not,
however, required to complete our initial business combination with a financial
technology business and, as a result, we may pursue a business combination
outside of that industry. We will seek to acquire established businesses that we
believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial,
operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We do not
intend to acquire start-up companies, companies with speculative business plans
or companies that are excessively leveraged.
---

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of
the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. However, we
may structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of the
equity interest or assets of the target business, but only if we (or any entity
that is a successor to us in a business combination) acquire a majority of the
outstanding voting securities or assets of the target. We believe that, if we
own a majority of the target’s outstanding voting securities, we will not be
required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, since the securities of a
majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are
not deemed to be “investment securities” as defined in the Investment Company
Act, and since we expect that 60% or more of the value of our total assets
(excluding government securities and cash) will be represented by the securities
of our target business which we expect will be an operating business. Even if we
own a majority interest in the target, our stockholders prior to the business
combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business
combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in
the business combination transaction.

Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or
more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least
80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a
definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The
fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of
directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial
community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable
businesses. If our board is not independently able to determine the fair market
value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm, and that is
reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., which we refer to as Cantor
Fitzgerald, as representative of the underwriters, with respect to fair market
value and that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders
from a financial point of view. However, if our securities are not listed on
Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be required to
consummate a business combination with a target whose fair market value equals
at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account).

In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we
anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our
attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market
participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to
divest non-core assets or divisions.

In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive
due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews
of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial
and other information about the target and its industry.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a
company that is affiliated with our sponsor, initial holders, officers or
directors, nor are we prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or
entering into any similar transaction with our sponsor, or an affiliate of our
sponsor, in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to
complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with
our sponsor, one of our initial holders or any of their respective affiliates in
our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of
