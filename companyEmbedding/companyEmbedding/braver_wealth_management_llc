Why Take More Risk Than You Need?
Risk Control
By combining traditional, long-term diversified investing with our proprietary tactical strategies, Braver Wealth aims to offer you a steady, consistent investment return with less risk than traditional investment managers.
Seeking to provide downside risk control to avoid major market declines is the hallmark of Braver’s tactical strategies. Our analysts use computer models to recognize market trends, favoring investing when the trends are strong. When we detect deteriorating trends, we proactively move assets to safer investments, such as money market funds – to avoid steep market declines.
How we do it
Our strategies seek to reduce risk by utilizing computer models that monitor market data, follow specific stop loss rules, use strategic position sizing and diversify asset classes and model types. Tactical management can help to preserve capital and provide the peace of mind that most investors cannot find on their own or in strictly traditional investment strategies.
Avoiding large losses allows investors to maintain a disciplined investment plan. At the same time, consistent compounding of positive investment returns provides a better chance of meeting long-term goals and objectives.

What We Do – Making Your Financial Life Easier
As life expectancy increases, planning for you and your family’s financial future can become complicated. High quality financial planning can never be ‘one-size-fits-all.’ Our Relationship Managers draw upon extensive skills and significant experience to work with you. We ask good questions, we listen to you carefully, and we try to ensure that life’s inevitable complications do not impede your dreams.
We aim to very clearly understand your goals – what is important to you now and your lifestyle expectations at every stage of life. We create detailed long-term financial projections, painting a vivid picture of your current status and your path as you glide toward retirement. And we factor in the individual needs and preferences you have regarding inheritance and philanthropy.
We don’t simply answer your questions.  We try to make your financial life easier.  Here are a few of the ways we seek to do this:

By creating and updating your annual net worth statement each year
By cataloguing and providing feedback on all of your insurance coverage
By helping clients understand their social security options and optimizing their benefits
By sending regular email updates on topics such as tax changes or the best online saving options
By taking care of your annual Minimum Required Distribution (after you reach age 70)
By reminding you each year to receive your three free annual credit reports
By updating your account beneficiaries whenever your estate plan changes
By recommending talented advisors in areas like insurance, estate planning, mortgage refinance, bill-paying, elder care, real estate, etc.
By creating a retirement-paycheck, an automatic distribution every month to your checking account
By helping you set up and properly fund 529 plans to save for your children or grandchildren’s college education
By helping you give away money over time by setting up a donor advised fund, such as the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund
By holding complimentary client seminars on topics of interest

                STAY AWAY FROM BRAVER!!!! Braver Wealth Management professionally 'managed' my retirement account to a $16,000 loss in 8 months. They lost 6 years on investments in 6 months. They have the ability to move money into a cash account to mitigate losses but they don't use it. They are not watching your account nor are they concerned with your financial well-being. They will continue to take their 1% 'service fee' even when losing your life savings. The only advice I received repeatedly was to stay the course. The course led me to a $3000 loss in 2 weeks, $6000 in 2 month and gradually $16,000 in 8 months. All this while the Dow is down only 200 points.… read more

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients. As my agent, Nathan meets me with intelligence, patience, humor, warmth, knowledge and empathy.

I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more
