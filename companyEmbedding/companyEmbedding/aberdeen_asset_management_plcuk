History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]

Managing Mergers: Will Aberdeen Asset Management – Standard Life Go Through?


Winners and Losers

Managing Mergers: Will Aberdeen Asset Management – Standard Life Go Through?

Managing Mergers: Will Aberdeen Asset Management – Standard Life Go Through?






 
 
 
 


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is a non-ministerial government department that ensures markets function well for consumers, businesses and the economy. The CMA’s mission is to observe situations where there is a chance of unfair treatment or market problems.
One of its key responsibilities is to investigate mergers in the UK. Note that the CMA does not assess all mergers; some are assessed by the European Commission, particularly mergers of businesses within the EU or ones with global revenues above a certain threshold.
A More Focused Change
The CMA is reducing the number of mergers it investigates in smaller markets. Only important enough merger references will be warranted;  the figure for markets has been raised to over £15m from over £10m. Also, the figure for markets considered not important enough to warrant a merger reference has been raised from below £3m to below £5m.
What Does This Mean?
Sheldon Mills, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said:

“It’s important that we focus our resources on those mergers with the most potential to harm customers.”

The number of investigations will particularly reduce mergers where the cost is not worth the effect it has on the market. This means the CMA will become more cost and time effective, placing more focus on the mergers of larger businesses, which bear more risk.
Smaller businesses will merge more easily, without losing a lot of revenue, paying legal fees. The larger combined company should deliver a better financial performance for the shareholders and greater performance in the markets through synergy & economies of scale.
However, there is always a risk of failure when considering the culture clash and the integration the operations of two businesses; which is why only around 50% of M&A deals are successful overall. Despite this, by allowing smaller businesses to merge, the CMA will give them the opportunity to dominate their sector and have fewer rivals.
A Promising Merger
The CMA investigated the desired merger on 22 May 2017. It cleared it’s Phase 1 investigation on 22 June 2017 but has yet to clear the Phase 2 investigation by 18 July 2017. Once the deal is completed, Standard Life Aberdeen Plc is set to trade on LSE (14th August 2017).
Speculation was rife, on the 19th of June after it was released that 98.6% of Standard Life and 95.8% of Aberdeen Asset Management shareholders voted to approve the merger. This caused Aberdeen Asset Management’s stock price to fall, which indicated uncertainty amongst investors despite the approval of shareholders. A possible reason for this is that Standard Life shareholders would own 66.7 percent of the combined firm; this means that Aberdeen shareholders’ stock, is worth significantly less, hence the plummet in stock price.

After the deal closes, investor confidence should increase and so the share price of the combined entity should subsequently increase, particularly after Simon Troughton, chairman of Aberdeen said:

“This deal opens up significant opportunities across all facets of Aberdeen’s business and is an important step towards realising the company’s ambition of creating a world-class investment business with a truly global footprint.”

The above quote highlights the main reason why mergers occur: it allows two companies to combine their strengths, have a larger market share and greater dominance in the investment sector. The merger between Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management is an instance where this will hopefully hold.
Conclusion
Mergers are made to please shareholders and generate more revenue. Many mergers have succeeded like (Orange & T-Mobile, 2010), while others have failed (AOL & Time Warner, 2009).
The CMA is the first hurdle that merging companies must pass. The CMA’s assessment ensures that mergers do not gravely decrease competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers. Later, further complications may arise such as a culture clash & failure to integrate operations.  However, if these problems are resolved, the merged business should have a brighter future in the financial market.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]
Operations[edit]

The company operates mainly in the United Kingdom but has a growing presence worldwide, particularly Asia, Oceania and the Americas, with over 2,500 staff, across 37 offices in 25 countries. Its headquarters are in the city of Aberdeen, where Group functions including legal, group information and human resources are located, and has its major investment desks in London, Philadelphia and Singapore.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
