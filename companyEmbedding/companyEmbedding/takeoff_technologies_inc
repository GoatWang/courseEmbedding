Takeoff Technologies Selects Symphony GOLD as its End-to-End Retail Platform


Innovative grocery delivery startup to deploy full supply chain, merchandising, store operations and marketing capabilities to power innovative click-and-collect business
Paris, France – March 14, 2016 – Symphony GOLD, provider of the GOLD unified software platform for omni-channel retail, today announced that startup Takeoff Technologies Inc., which promises to bring fast, full-selection click-and-collect to grocery chains, has selected the Symphony GOLD platform to support its operations. Takeoff Technologies Inc., has licensed the complete Symphony GOLD suite including supply chain, merchandise management, and store operations.
 
Amid growing demand for online grocery services, retailers want to provide consumers with competitive prices, variety, immediacy, assortment and all-round convenience. Takeoff Technologies promises a different, consumer-friendly, fresh and fast new alternative with all the variety of a traditional supermarket, but without paying for the service. 
 
“The Takeoff business model revolves around developing small micro fulfillment centers for online grocery orders in places where end consumers live, work or transit, to pick up their order at their convenience,” said José Vincente Aguerrevere, co-founder, Takeoff Technologies. “We will be deploying the Symphony GOLD platform alongside warehouse automation technology in order to provide the same assortment as a supermarket, in a space 15 times smaller and with less than one tenth of the labor required.”
 
Combining the best developments from online retail operators with material handling automation technology, Takeoff Technologies makes the online grocery concept viable in a small neighborhood facility.  “We want to serve our clients in less than half an hour, something that the on-demand shopping operators have shown significant interest in. Finally, in terms of retailers, we seek to work with the assortment of existing supermarkets and help them create shareholder value by driving comps at low fulfillment costs,” explained Max Pedro, co-founder, Takeoff Technologies.
 
Takeoff plans to give back the time consumers spend in the supermarket and to break barriers of shopping for groceries online.  “Through Takeoff, customers will be free to use those 80+ hours that the average family spends a year in supermarkets for other activities of their choice,” explained Rafael Pieretti, co-founder, Takeoff Technologies. 
“Symphony GOLD is delighted that Takeoff Technologies has selected the Symphony GOLD Unified Retail Platform,” said Gregg Monastiero, president, United States, Symphony GOLD. “We’re excited to help such an innovative new company get off the ground, and we look forward to supporting its rapid growth in the years to come.”
