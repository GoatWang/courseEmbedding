What Clients are Saying About Robert



I was fortunate enough to take an Exec|Comm public speaking class that Robert and his Exec|Comm colleagues led. He provided valuable and constructive feedback and was able to make significant impacts in one day’s time with myself and everyone else I had observed in the class.
A week after the class was offered, I was able to use the guidance that Robert had provided and delivered my best presentation I had ever given to a large group of colleagues. The skills I had learned from Robert allowed me to really connect with my audience and I feel that my message was clear and well received. I’d highly recommend taking any class Robert offers, he has an impactful way of delivering information that really allows you to get the most out of his class.Rebecca Rowe, Vice President - Valuation, BlackRockI had a very rewarding experience after attending “Communicating with Impact” workshop at EY’s Advisory Immersion training taught by Robert Chen and his colleagues from Exec|Comm. Robert’s well prepared training materials combined with his professional, yet upbeat and interactive training style have definitely kept the trainees enthusiastically engaged throughout the day. The audiences were a group of about 60 experienced new hires at EY from various reputable companies with extreme diverse backgrounds, job titles and years of experiences. There were constant nodding heads, laughters and hands in the air with questions. I highly recommend Robert’s services to organizations and individuals who are interested in developing leadership with exceptional communication skills.Odbayar Batbold, Senior Consultant, Ernst & YoungRobert really helped me form a strategy for determining and designing the career path and lifestyle I desired. With a thoughtful and pragmatic approach, he taught me to understand and prioritize my goals and to plot out the next action steps. Robert’s own career path, experiences, and achievements are inspiring, and he is an effective motivator as well. I highly recommend retaining his services.Micah Acoba, Advisor, Alpha QuotientRobert is driven, thoughtful, intelligent and above all, a great listener. One thing that differentiates Robert from other life coaches I’ve met is his passion for success and his belief that any dream is possible. He has a genuine interest in what I wanted to do and helped me identify steps to reach that goal. The coaching sessions with Embrace Possibility were small, personalized workshops filled with fun and thought-provoking exercises. Robert evaluated the information and provided candid feedback and guidance on next steps.Christine Wong, Associate Product Manager, Priceline.com

CoachI help high performers find the difference that makes the difference in both their professional and personal lives.




My life’s work is to help people reach their full potential by sharing insightful strategies and teaching practical skills.
I work for Exec|Comm, a communication skills consultancy in NYC, helping leaders build authentic relationships, gain buy-in for their vision and communicate with more impact. In my spare time, I enjoy guiding successful professionals to find their true professional calling in my work with Embrace Possibility.
My philosophy
To be great, you have to pursue and reach mastery at what you’re called to do .
That calling comes from within you and the only way to hear it is through self reflection and introspection and taking action on what you uncover so that you can uncover more.
High performers who don’t follow their calling may do well initially but then end up living a life of mediocrity once the initial learning and novelty wears off. To have staying power to reach mastery, you need to take on functions that you are truly interested in.
In addition to finding your professional calling, it’s important to also set and attain your personal, financial and health-related goals.
My approach
With all of my engagements, I start by helping my clients gain clarity around their current situation and finding the drivers for the results they are currently experiencing.
Next, we focus on the specific outcomes my client would like to achieve. If there are skill gaps, we fill those in with experiential skill building drawing either on my expertise or those of relevant experts. If there are willingness gaps, we explore the reasons for sticking to the “less effective” habit and make a decision on whether to accept or challenge the status quo.
Throughout my sessions, I invest fully in my client’s success and remain both flexible and persistent to help my clients achieve positive results.
My responsibility
Clarity.   Support.   Trust.
Coaching is not about telling you what to do but about inviting you to be curious about your own experiences and to discover, clarify and align your actions with what you want to achieve. I am trained to listen, observe and customize my approach to your needs but ultimately it is your creativity and resourcefulness that will generate the solutions and strategies to move you forward.
I am responsible to keep the focus on your needs and to continuously learn new ways to shine light on your blind spots and guide you through your self-exploration. I will suggest strategies from time to time but the choice is always yours.  One of my main duties is to empower you and to keep you responsible and accountable for the commitments you make.
Everything discussed during the coaching session is strictly confidential and I promise to safeguard all your information. I firmly believe that the key to a successful coaching partnership is trust.




I’ve worked with professionals from top firms and organizations in:
Management Consulting
Investment Banking and Finance
Wealth and Asset Management
Accounting and Professional Services
Consumer Products
Insurance

DesignerI design training experiences that are:




Interactive
I build training experiences that lead to sustainable behavior change by engineering insightful exercises where participants learn and practice useful skills in a context relevant to their work. Participants spend most of the session executing the skills with guided feedback and will learn how to practice the skills on their own.




Outcome-Focused
I work closely with you and your stakeholders to narrow down the specific business outcomes you’re looking to accomplish and translate those outcomes to tangible skills to hone. I clarify the behaviors you can look for to assess the effectiveness of the training or coaching and build a program to achieve those outcomes.




Sustainable
Knowledge and understanding is not enough to yield impactful change if there is no action and no follow up. When your participants go back to work, there is a good chance that the urgent will trump the important. I build follow up into our post-program experience to ensure your participants sustain their learning.

What my clients are saying:




I am someone who is very work driven and often thinks I know exactly what I need. Despite this, I still found the “Know What You Want” Career Workshop to be very helpful. The course was quite comprehensive and made me really slow down to reflect on who I am, my values, what was important and not important in my life. This course is a great resource for those in need of some guidance in their career paths.Amy K., Portfolio Manager



When I attended Robert’s Know What You Want Workshop, I was still in college and feeling a bit hopeless. I did not know what I was looking
for in my career and was not doing too well in my job application
process. Through the workshop I was able to clarify and weigh the
different things I value most in my ideal career.
What I found most helpful was the 1-on-1 sessions with Rob. He helped me on many fronts from interviewing, identifying specific positions, improving weaknesses, and just overall analysis and feedback on my job search process. After college, I successfully found a job with many of the attributes that I was looking for, so I would definitely recommend Robert’s program and services.Esther C., Investment Associate



At first, I didn’t know what to expect or what I can get out of the Know What You Want workshop. I was three years out of college, working in my 2nd job, and questioning myself if this was really it; if what I was doing and the career path I was on was right for me. The problem was that I had no idea what I wanted to do; I didn’t even know where to start. I took the workshop and felt that it really made me reflect on myself and helped me to realize how my life can be so much more fulfilling if I loved my job. Rob’s workshop also provided me with the tools and resources I needed to continue researching on how to get there. Rob is really passionate about what he does and it is apparent in his work and communication. I am very thankful and excited to be working with him on this important journey and confident that I will get there with his help.Amy S., Equity Analyst







The knowledge I gained after attending the “Know what you want” workshop had an immense and positive affect on my overall attitude towards life. This workshop is not an infomercial promising instant results. You will gain an understanding of your values and establish a strong foundation to help you move forward in your life/career.
Since the workshop, I have used all that I learned and accomplished a whole host of goals, both personal and professional.
Major goals accomplished since the “Know what you want” workshop:
* Trained for and ran the Staten Island half marathon (health goal)
* Organized and currently running a basketball league with 36 participants (community goal)
* Hosted a “lunch and learn” at my workplace on photography (self confidence goal)
A lot of time and effort was put into this workshop to help you find your passion and bring to light the tools that are needed to be successful in whatever you choose to pursue. Robert is a true professional who takes pride in uncovering your strengths and fusing them with your passion(s).Job S., Financial Services Consultant



Robert is a perfect coach to improve your career-related skills such as business presentation for clients. He knows how to organize your presentation and deliver your message to people. I really appreciate his work!Hisashi A., Corporate Banker



I attended the 2 day Know What You Want career workshop and found it to be very professional/organized and thought provoking. Classes were small and interactive. If you feel a little lost or in need of some direction on your career path, this is the class for you!Stephen C., Software Engineer

			What is the difference between a coach and mentor?		


Robert Chen 


			2015-02-11T22:27:41+00:00		
What is the difference between a coach and mentor?Here is a nice explanation by Michael Ehling (www.balancecoaching.com):
A mentor knows from experience and teaches that knowledge. Mentors can say, “I’ve been there. I can help you avoid my mistakes and use my successes.” Mentoring conversations look like this, “Here’s what you need to do next.”
A coach uses a process to help you understand where you are, where you’d like to go next, what the next steps to get there are, and how to handle any roadblocks (typically stemming from perspective).

			Who should consider coaching?		


Robert Chen 


			2016-12-21T00:58:44+00:00		
Who should consider coaching?High performers who want to reach the next level without making all the mistakes.
“I’ve done just fine without a coach…”
You may be doing just fine but what does that really mean?
Are you living the life YOU really want?
If not, do you recognize the barriers that are stopping you?
You are the expert of your professional and personal life and you ALREADY have all the creativity and resources to live to your fullest potential. Coaches are experts on helping you identify and define the goals that matter to you and to support you in maximizing the life you want to live.  Well-defined goals along with new skills and insights will allow you to move toward achieving those goals faster and more effortlessly.
If you decide to engage in a coaching relationship, you can expect to experience fresh perspectives on life’s challenges and opportunities, improved thinking and decision-making skills, enhanced interpersonal effectiveness, and increased confidence in all aspects of your life. This will lead to noticeable results in personal effectiveness and satisfaction along with a strong sense of achievement and happiness.


			What are the benefits of coaching?		


Robert Chen 


			2016-12-21T00:58:44+00:00		
What are the benefits of coaching?

Finally…You CAN Live the Life You Want
Most people never reach their full potential because they don’t think it is possible to live the life they want and deserve. If you don’t believe me, just look around you.
The rewards of coaching compounds so the earlier you start the more you will benefit. Not all coaches are created equal and you need to choose wisely.
Here are the benefits you can receive:








Distinguishing Wants from ShouldsI will help you distinguish your “wants” (which is important) from your “shoulds” (which are not as important). When you can confidently answer the question, “Why do you do what you do?”, you will begin to live life with a sense of purpose and become committed to achieving your goals. Interestingly, when you commit, achieving your goal becomes inevitable. This is the preventative cure for the “mid-life crisis”.

Setting Effective GoalsHow many times have you disappointed yourself by starting something but never finishing it? As your coach, I will help you GET what you want through effective goal setting.
Live life with no regrets. With the proper goals, anything is possible.Challenging Limiting Beliefs“I am too young, I am too old, I am a minority, I never went to college, I am not smart enough, I can’t do that, etc.”
These are examples of the many beliefs that actively hold people back from getting what they want. I will help you to challenge your beliefs and to recognize that you don’t need permission to be happy and live the life you want.Identifying StrengthsDo you want to be good or do you want to be GREAT?
Life becomes easier when you stop trying to improve your weaknesses and you work on enhancing your strengths. The first step is to identify them and I will show you how.Providing Specific FeedbackWe can only see things through our own eyes and that makes us susceptible to blind spots. Imagine rushing to go somewhere and deciding to drive full speed just to find out you were going the wrong way.
I will help you prevent that by giving you a third person’s perspective of the situation.Upholding AccountabilityHow easy is it to give up when we are by ourselves. Most people quit right before the finish line.
I will make sure you stay motivated by consistently reminding you of the commitments you have made and provide support when you need it. If you’ve ever worked out with someone, you know how different that is compared to working out by yourself.Achieving BalanceHow many people do you know have great careers but poor relationships or a lot of money but poor health?
My philosophy is that you cannot reach your full potential unless you enrich the main areas of your life:
Health
Financial Freedom
Relationships
Personal Development
Professional Development
You have all the resources necessary to achieve your highest potential. My role is to help you identify the best places to allocate those resources.Removing RiskIt is not easy to invest your hard-earned money on self-development especially with someone you’ve never met or worked with so I have decided to take all the risk out of your decision. I’m confident in what I do and if I don’t provide you with enough value, then I won’t take your money.




			What to expect from our time together?		


Robert Chen 


			2016-12-21T00:58:48+00:00		
What to expect from our time together?Having worked with clients from various industries, I have come to realize that the fundamentals of my methodology remain the same. The first thing I do is to conduct an initial consultation to make sure I am the right coach for you. The second is to verify that you are willing and committed to improve (It is okay if you don’t know how, as long as you are willing). I will not coach people who do not WANT to be coached. It would be a waste of everyone’s time.
After securing a commitment to the coaching relationship, we will work together to clarify and create a plan to achieve the goals that you want. The usual commitment is for 3-6 month period meeting every 2 weeks (6-12 sessions).
I love coaching and training others to be their best and I have extensively researched the 5 key aspects for living your life to the fullest. I am passionate about reaching my highest potential and I apply everything I learn in my life before ever presenting it to you.


			How is coaching different from consulting, therapy and/or having a supportive friend?		


Robert Chen 


			2016-12-21T00:58:48+00:00		
How is coaching different from consulting, therapy and/or having a supportive friend?Consulting provides temporary or intermittent solutions while coaching is a consistent, ongoing relationship where the coach stays with the client to help them achieve their goals through skill building and change management. Consulting often involves telling people what they should do while coaching focuses on helping the client discover the solution on his/her own.
Coaching is not therapy. Coaching is focused on the client and provides the support and strategy to make changes based on the awareness a client holds. Coaching is movement oriented and action based. Therapy brings understanding and awareness of the past to a client to help resolve conflicting issues they have impeded them.
A supportive friend is great but they rarely hold the objectivity and distance a coach would. A coach is a professional who is trusted to work with you on the most important aspects of your life and to offer a different perspective of the truth because of the emotional distance the professional relationship offers.

Tiziana Bond



Richard A. Mathies
He received his B. S. Degree in Chemistry in 1968 at the University of Washington working with Martin Gouterman. He earned the M. S. Degree in 1970 and the Ph. D. in 1973 in Physical Chemistry at Cornell University from Andreas Albrecht. Following two years of postdoctoral study as a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University with Lubert Stryer, he moved to the Chemistry Department at the University of California at Berkeley in 1976 where he is G. N. Lewis Professor of Chemistry and Dean of the College of Chemistry.  



					Mathies' biophysical research is focused on the use of resonance Raman and time resolved optical spectroscopy to elucidate the structure and reaction dynamics of energy and information transducing photoactive proteins. His extensive work on the photochemistry of the visual pigment rhodopsin has established the structure of the primary photoproduct using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy, demonstrated that the primary cis-to-trans photoisomerization in vision is complete in only 200 fs, and analyzed the nonstationary state or wavepacket evolution that defines the excited state isomerization mechanism. His recent development of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy provides a revolutionary new way to study the structural dynamics of photochemical and photophysical processes with complete high resolution Raman vibrational spectra and <50 fs time resolution.



					Mathies' work in the area of biotechnology and the Human Genome Project led to the development of new high-speed, high-throughput DNA analysis technologies such as capillary array electrophoresis and energy transfer (ET) fluorescent dye labels for DNA sequencing and analysis. In particular, his development of ET fluorescent labels was a critical contribution to the early completion of the Human Genome sequence. He also pioneered the development of microfabricated capillary electrophoresis devices and microfabricated integrated sample preparation and detection methods for lab-on-a-chip analysis systems that are being applied to DNA sequencing, diagnostics, forensics, pathogen detection and space exploration.   



					Mathies is author of more than 430 publications and 40 patents on biophysical chemistry, photochemistry, photobiology, bioanalytical chemistry and genome analysis technology. He has also been active in consulting and working with biotechnology companies including Affymax, Affymetrix, Molecular Dynamics, US Biochemical, Amersham-Pharmacia, Bio-Rad, Singulex, and IntegenX among others.

Robert:
Coaches, Writes, Speaks,
Designs and Reads.












CoachI help high performers find the difference that makes the difference in both their professional and personal lives.




My life’s work is to help people reach their full potential by sharing insightful strategies and teaching practical skills.
I work for Exec|Comm, a communication skills consultancy in NYC, helping leaders build authentic relationships, gain buy-in for their vision and communicate with more impact. In my spare time, I enjoy guiding successful professionals to find their true professional calling in my work with Embrace Possibility.
My philosophy
To be great, you have to pursue and reach mastery at what you’re called to do .
That calling comes from within you and the only way to hear it is through self reflection and introspection and taking action on what you uncover so that you can uncover more.
High performers who don’t follow their calling may do well initially but then end up living a life of mediocrity once the initial learning and novelty wears off. To have staying power to reach mastery, you need to take on functions that you are truly interested in.
In addition to finding your professional calling, it’s important to also set and attain your personal, financial and health-related goals.
My approach
With all of my engagements, I start by helping my clients gain clarity around their current situation and finding the drivers for the results they are currently experiencing.
Next, we focus on the specific outcomes my client would like to achieve. If there are skill gaps, we fill those in with experiential skill building drawing either on my expertise or those of relevant experts. If there are willingness gaps, we explore the reasons for sticking to the “less effective” habit and make a decision on whether to accept or challenge the status quo.
Throughout my sessions, I invest fully in my client’s success and remain both flexible and persistent to help my clients achieve positive results.
My responsibility
Clarity.   Support.   Trust.
Coaching is not about telling you what to do but about inviting you to be curious about your own experiences and to discover, clarify and align your actions with what you want to achieve. I am trained to listen, observe and customize my approach to your needs but ultimately it is your creativity and resourcefulness that will generate the solutions and strategies to move you forward.
I am responsible to keep the focus on your needs and to continuously learn new ways to shine light on your blind spots and guide you through your self-exploration. I will suggest strategies from time to time but the choice is always yours.  One of my main duties is to empower you and to keep you responsible and accountable for the commitments you make.
Everything discussed during the coaching session is strictly confidential and I promise to safeguard all your information. I firmly believe that the key to a successful coaching partnership is trust.




I’ve worked with professionals from top firms and organizations in:
Management Consulting
Investment Banking and Finance
Wealth and Asset Management
Accounting and Professional Services
Consumer Products
Insurance
Academia

DesignerI design training experiences that are:




Interactive
I build training experiences that lead to sustainable behavior change by engineering insightful exercises where participants learn and practice useful skills in a context relevant to their work. Participants spend most of the session executing the skills with guided feedback and will learn how to practice the skills on their own.




Outcome-Focused
I work closely with you and your stakeholders to narrow down the specific business outcomes you’re looking to accomplish and translate those outcomes to tangible skills to hone. I clarify the behaviors you can look for to assess the effectiveness of the training or coaching and build a program to achieve those outcomes.




Sustainable
Knowledge and understanding is not enough to yield impactful change if there is no action and no follow up. When your participants go back to work, there is a good chance that the urgent will trump the important. I build follow up into our post-program experience to ensure your participants sustain their learning.

What my clients are saying:




I am someone who is very work driven and often thinks I know exactly what I need. Despite this, I still found the “Know What You Want” Career Workshop to be very helpful. The course was quite comprehensive and made me really slow down to reflect on who I am, my values, what was important and not important in my life. This course is a great resource for those in need of some guidance in their career paths.Amy K., Portfolio Manager



When I attended Robert’s Know What You Want Workshop, I was still in college and feeling a bit hopeless. I did not know what I was looking
for in my career and was not doing too well in my job application
process. Through the workshop I was able to clarify and weigh the
different things I value most in my ideal career.
What I found most helpful was the 1-on-1 sessions with Rob. He helped me on many fronts from interviewing, identifying specific positions, improving weaknesses, and just overall analysis and feedback on my job search process. After college, I successfully found a job with many of the attributes that I was looking for, so I would definitely recommend Robert’s program and services.Esther C., Investment Associate



At first, I didn’t know what to expect or what I can get out of the Know What You Want workshop. I was three years out of college, working in my 2nd job, and questioning myself if this was really it; if what I was doing and the career path I was on was right for me. The problem was that I had no idea what I wanted to do; I didn’t even know where to start. I took the workshop and felt that it really made me reflect on myself and helped me to realize how my life can be so much more fulfilling if I loved my job. Rob’s workshop also provided me with the tools and resources I needed to continue researching on how to get there. Rob is really passionate about what he does and it is apparent in his work and communication. I am very thankful and excited to be working with him on this important journey and confident that I will get there with his help.Amy S., Equity Analyst







The knowledge I gained after attending the “Know what you want” workshop had an immense and positive affect on my overall attitude towards life. This workshop is not an infomercial promising instant results. You will gain an understanding of your values and establish a strong foundation to help you move forward in your life/career.
Since the workshop, I have used all that I learned and accomplished a whole host of goals, both personal and professional.
Major goals accomplished since the “Know what you want” workshop:
* Trained for and ran the Staten Island half marathon (health goal)
* Organized and currently running a basketball league with 36 participants (community goal)
* Hosted a “lunch and learn” at my workplace on photography (self confidence goal)
A lot of time and effort was put into this workshop to help you find your passion and bring to light the tools that are needed to be successful in whatever you choose to pursue. Robert is a true professional who takes pride in uncovering your strengths and fusing them with your passion(s).Job S., Financial Services Consultant



Robert is a perfect coach to improve your career-related skills such as business presentation for clients. He knows how to organize your presentation and deliver your message to people. I really appreciate his work!Hisashi A., Corporate Banker



I attended the 2 day Know What You Want career workshop and found it to be very professional/organized and thought provoking. Classes were small and interactive. If you feel a little lost or in need of some direction on your career path, this is the class for you!Stephen C., Software Engineer
