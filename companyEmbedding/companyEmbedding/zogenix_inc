Zogenix Is On The Precipice Of Substantial Growth - Zogenix, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZGNX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Zogenix Is On The Precipice Of Substantial GrowthFeb.24.17 | About: Zogenix, Inc. (ZGNX) Tim Harrison Biotech, Growth at A Reasonable Price, special situations, small-capSummaryThe company has a promising drug candidate in late stage trials.Zogenix has several upcoming catalysts in 2017.The company's lead product candidate targets an unmet need for the treatment of a devastating childhood condition.Introduction Zogenix Inc., (NASDAQ:ZGNX), is a developmental pharmaceutical company that is developing therapies to treat central nervous system disorders. The Company's therapies target specific clinical needs for patients living with orphan diseases and other CNS disorders who need alternative treatments in order to improve their daily quality of life. The company was founded in 2006, and over the last few years, has divested itself of a few products in order to focus on clinical development of promising compounds. Zogenix continues to receive some revenue for manufacturing services and royalties. While this stream of revenue is somewhat valuable, and the company has some promising early-stage compounds in development, the primary driver of value for Zogenix for the foreseeable future will be its lead investigational product ZX008. Dravet Syndrome This drug candidate is for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome. This condition, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy, is a rare, catastrophic and life-long form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. The condition is characterized by frequent and/or prolonged seizures, usually beginning in the first year of life. Developmental delays, movement and balance issues, speech-language delays, growth and nutrition issues and chronic infection are just some of the maladies associated with Dravet. What is worse, approximately 15-20 percent of Dravet patience die due to SUDEP or Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy, prolonged seizures, seizure related accidents such as drowning and infections. This affliction occurs in 1 out of every 15,700 infants born in the United States. Current treatments are very limited. A combination of currently available anticonvulsants is standard-of-care, but outcomes remain poor and there are no effective, long-term treatments. With such a debilitating, childhood condition and few treatment options, it is no wonder that the FDA granted orphan drug designation to ZX008. European regulators have also granted this designation.
 ZX008 Zogenix's lead investigational product candidate is a low-dose fenfluramine liquid solution for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The company owns exclusive license to data and intellectual property on the use of low-dose fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet. In January of 2017, Zogenix announced it had received a method of treatment patent for the treatment of Dravet with ZX008 that covers claims through 2033. In the same press release, the company announced that it was pursuing additional patents to protect their lead product candidate. In addition, ZX008 also received both orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe and fast track designation in the U.S. Clinical Trials Zogenix is currently conducting phase three studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fenfluramine, with multiple data reads due in 2017. In addition, the company has garnered very promising results in earlier stage studies. The first report released in 2012 highlights results from a long-term, open-label study of fenfluramine in combination with commonly used anticonvulsants. This study included 12 children with Dravet syndrome ranging in age from nine months to 13 years. Sixty-seven percent of patients were seizure free for one year or longer and 9 out of 12 patients had overall seizure reduction of 75% or greater. In a five-year followup in 2016, 90% of these children had an average seizure frequency of less than one per month. Three out of ten patients were seizure free for the entire five year period. Four out of ten patients were seizure free for at least two years. In addition, there were no major safety issues and the treatment was well-tolerated. In December of 2016 at the Annual American Epilepsy Society Meeting, Zogenix presented results from an open-label observational study. In this study, nine patients with Dravet who were being treated with standard-of-care anticonvulsants were given fenfluramine as an add-on in doses ranging from .2 to .7 mg a day. The results were once again impressive. During a three-month baseline, the median major seizure per month was 15. After three months of treatment, the average number of seizures among these patients had dropped to just over two per month. The study found a 76% median reduction in monthly seizures over the entire study period which averaged 2.7 years in duration. There were no major adverse effects and most importantly, no evidence of cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension, conditions associated with high doses of fenfluramine.
 With promising results from these two earlier studies, the company has advanced ZX008 into phase three clinical trials. Studies 1501 and 1502 are identical trials taking place in North America and the EU and Australia, respectively. Patients in both of these trials are administered two different dosing levels of the drug and these results will be compared to placebo. These studies will asses the safety and efficacy of this treatment, as well as help researchers determine appropriate dosing. Clinical trial 1504 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenfluramine as an add-on to patients who have not responded to the standard-of-care medication stiripentol. Zogenix reported that enrollment during the fourth quarter of 2016 accelerated and anticipates this to continue throughout the first quarter of 2017. One of the studies has completed enrollment and the company should have data to report in the second quarter of this year. The FDA's website indicates that final data collection for 1502 will be completed in June 2017, and data collection for 1501 should be completed this month. Final data collection for 1504 should be completed in August of 2017. The company indicated that they should be able to announce data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2017 and file for approval in both the U.S. and Europe during this same quarter. In short, there are several major catalysts coming up for Zogenix stock over the next ten months. Based on previous studies, I anticipate these data will be positive and Zogenix's stock price will appreciate nicely as a result. 

Slide Courtesy of Zogenix, Inc. Company Guidance, Financials and Competition Like most developmental biotech companies, Zogenix continues to lose money and generate negative cash flows. The company indicated that it expects to continue to have losses and negative cash flow for at least the next year. More importantly however, Zogenix has roughly one hundred million dollars in cash. Its annual burn rate is around $40 million. In its September 2016 quarterly filing, the company indicated that it has enough cash to fund operations for the next twelve months, but it may need to return to the capital markets for additional funding, either through an equity offering, which would be dilutive, or through a debt offering. This possibility may become a reality as the company moves toward commercialization of ZX008.
 Regarding competition, ZX008, if approved, will meet an unmet medical need. Current standard-of-care for Davet, anticonvulsant therapies, are woefully inadequate. No long-term, effective treatment exists for Dravet. The clinical trials using ZX008, to date, offer much promise for patients with this awful condition, as well as to Zogenix shareholders. At the same time, other companies are developing drugs to treat Dravet. Laboratoires Biocodex has received approval and is marketing stiripentol as an adjunctive therapy in the EU, Canada and Japan. This treatment is not FDA approved, but patients can get access to the drug through the FDA's Personal Importation Policy. With that said, this therapy has not proved to be an effective long-term treatment. Epidiolex, a cannabinoid drug being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals also has received orphan drug designation by the EMA for the treatment of Dravet and by the FDA for the treatment of Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, as well as fast track designation by the FDA. GW has announced positive phase three data also, so this therapy may be ZX008's biggest threat. Price Action, Valuation and Analyst Coverage The company's stock price has been volatile to say the least, having reached a 52 week high of $13.70 and a low of $7.33. As of this writing, the stock sits around the middle of that range at $10.55. Over the last five years the stock has been north of $35 a share and above $20 a share as recently as February of 2015. Zogenix is a very small company with only a $260 million market capitalization. Though the company is not heavily covered by analysts, the five that do are bullish on the stock with an average price target of $19.80, which would represent an 87% gain from current levels. As always, any stock I favor is intended as a long-term investment, not as a short term trade opportunity. These five analyst project the company will grow earnings at 25% annually over the next five years. Conclusion I believe the timing is right for an investment in Zogenix. The company has several potential catalyst coming up this year and the possibility of a commercial launch in 2018. This is often a good stage at which to invest in developmental biotech companies; those with promising drug candidates in late-stage clinical trials. ZX008 appears to be highly effective in treating a devastating, childhood disorder with few treatment options. In addition, the drug offers potentially substantial commercial opportunities for the company, and Zogenix has other, earlier stage drug candidates. The company has also announced positive data for ZX008 for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Zogenix may soon initiate phase three trials for this indication as well. I plan to provide an in depth analysis of the Lennox-Gastaut clinical program in a subsequent article.

Zogenix, Inc. and DURECT Corporation (DRRX) Announce Development and License Agreement for Antipsychotic Product Candidate
  











Tweet








7/12/2011 6:39:26 AM


SAN DIEGO and CUPERTINO, Calif., July 12, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zogenix, Inc. (Nasdaq:ZGNX - News), a pharmaceutical company commercializing and developing products for the treatment of central nervous system disorders and pain, and DURECT Corporation (Nasdaq:DRRX - News), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based upon its proprietary drug delivery platform technologies, announced today a development and license agreement. Under the agreement, Zogenix will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of a proprietary, long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone using DURECT's SABER(TM) controlled-release formulation technology in combination with Zogenix's DosePro(R) needle-free, subcutaneous drug delivery system. The Companies will also share non-clinical development responsibilities. Zogenix expects to initiate clinical studies for the new product candidate, Relday(TM), in patients with schizophrenia in early 2012 following filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.

Risperidone is one of the most widely prescribed medications used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults and teenagers 13 years of age and older. Relday will be developed to address unmet clinical needs in this large patient population. 


The Companies expect that, if approved, Relday will be the first once-monthly, subcutaneous antipsychotic product available in a needle-free delivery system to enter the long-acting injectable antipsychotic market. The existing long-acting injectable risperidone product, which achieved global net sales of $1.5 billion in 2010, requires twice monthly, 2 mL intramuscular injections with a 21 gauge or larger needle. The Companies also expect that, if approved, Relday will provide a new long-acting treatment option for patients that currently use daily oral antipsychotic products. The combined market for oral and injectable antipsychotic products is estimated at more than $16 billion in 2010. The Companies believe the SABER controlled-release technology will allow Relday to be delivered subcutaneously without a needle on a once-monthly basis with a simplified dosing regimen, improved pharmacokinetic profile and significant reduction in injection volume. This will be enabled by DosePro's unique ability to deliver highly viscous formulations.

Roger L. Hawley, chief executive officer of Zogenix, said, "Relday is the result of a focused preclinical formulation development effort with DURECT. We believe Relday has best-in-class potential because it consists of a proven drug with improved attributes that our market research indicates are preferred by psychiatrists. The target audience of U.S. psychiatrists can be covered efficiently with a relatively small sales force. Outside the United States, we expect Relday will be of great interest to prospective commercial partners. We look forward to working with DURECT to file an IND for Relday which will enable initiation of clinical development in early 2012."

James E. Brown, D.V.M., president and chief executive officer of DURECT Corporation, said, "Consummation of this collaboration further demonstrates the flexibility and broad potential associated with our SABER depot technology platform, which we are also employing in our POSIDUR(TM) program which is in Phase III as well as with proteins and peptides in multiple feasibility projects. In conjunction with the DosePro delivery system, our goal is to develop a product that meets psychiatrists' and patients' preference for a long-acting, subcutaneous, needle-free antipsychotic medication. Zogenix has successfully developed and commercialized a CNS product, and we are pleased to work with them on this exciting opportunity with Relday." 

Mr. Hawley added, "We view this licensing deal as further validation of the value that our proprietary DosePro delivery system can provide to potential product candidates. We have demonstrated that physicians and patients are attracted to the technology with the launch of our first product, SUMAVEL DosePro, and we continue to focus on identifying new opportunities to more broadly leverage the technology."


Under the terms of the agreement, Zogenix will make an upfront payment of $2.25 million to DURECT, with the potential to pay DURECT up to an additional $103 million in future clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments based upon successful achievement of certain events. Zogenix will have exclusive global rights to commercialize Relday and will pay DURECT a royalty on Relday product sales. 

Zogenix will provide additional details on the agreement and the anticipated expenses associated with the development of Relday on the Company's second quarter 2011 financial results conference call.

Zogenix Forward Looking Statements

Zogenix cautions you that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "indicates," "will," "intends," "potential," "suggests," "assuming," "designed" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the company's current beliefs and expectations. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the development and commercialization of a commercially successful product, the timing of filing an IND, the ability of such product to address the global anti-psychotic market, the ability to develop a once-monthly injectable product with improved pharmacokinetics and significant reduction in injection volume, ability to achieve first-in-class status, coverage of the target physician audience with a small sales force, partnering opportunities for Relday outside the United States, and leveraging the DosePro technology. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by Zogenix that any of its plans will be achieved. Actual results may differ from those set forth in this presentation due to the risk and uncertainties inherent in Zogenix's business, including, without limitation: the uncertainties associated with the clinical development and regulatory approval of product candidates such as Relday, the ability of Zogenix and DURECT to obtain, maintain and successfully enforce adequate patent and other intellectual property protection of Relday and the ability to operate its business without infringing the intellectual property rights of others; the market potential for anti-psychotics, and Zogenix's ability to compete within that market; inadequate therapeutic efficacy or unexpected adverse side effects relating to Relday that could prevent its development or commercialization, or that could result in recalls or product liability claims; Zogenix's dependence on its collaboration with DURECT to develop Relday; the ability of Zogenix to field a targeted sales force which successfully markets Relday; and other risks described in Zogenix's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof, and Zogenix undertakes no obligation to revise or update this presentation to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This caution is made under the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

DURECT Forward Looking Statement

The statements in this press release regarding the potential uses, benefits, commercial opportunity and possible market of Relday, expected timing of filing of an IND and initiation of clinical trials for Relday, expected returns to DURECT from commercialization of Relday, anticipated interest in Relday from possible commercialization collaborators outside the U.S. and potential milestone payments and royalties receivable from Zogenix for the development and commercialization of Relday are forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, DURECT's and Zogenix's difficulty or failure to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies with respect to its clinical trials and other development activities, or their respective abilities to design, enroll, conduct and complete clinical trials, failure of such clinical trials to produce intended results, failure to achieve the performance milestones or commercial sales that trigger the referenced payments or royalties, possible adverse events associated with the use of Relday, delays and costs due to additional work or other requirements imposed by regulatory agencies for continued development, approval or sale of Relday, our ability to complete the design, development, and manufacturing process development of Relday, and to manufacture, commercialize and obtain marketplace acceptance of Relday, and avoid infringing patents held by other parties and secure and defend patents of our own, and manage and obtain capital to fund our growth, operations and expenses.
