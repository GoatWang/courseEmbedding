Approach
      

Investment Philosophy
Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by offering "high-touch" capital and operational solutions in transitional investment situations where we can influence the outcome. We focus on investments that allow us to utilize a flexible approach to acquire stakes in companies or assets where we have control or significant influence and have the ability to transact across the full range of the capital
structure. A typical WL Ross transaction tends to be characterized by a combination of some or all of the following attributes:

Out-of-favor industries or industries undergoing regulatory change/dislocation
Businesses underperforming their peak operational or financial capabilities
Situations that require transitional capital
Complex special situations with attractive valuations
Transactions where we believe we can alter the risk/reward equation
Industries where we have a perceived competitive advantage

In summary, we target transactions where we believe we can alter the risk-reward for the benefit of our investors. 



Investment Process

Opportunistic buyouts
-Controlling interest and attractive entry valuation
-Platform consolidation
-Add value through operational improvement, strategic mergers and acquisitions,
optimization of capital structure and multiple expansion
Restructurings/turnarounds
-Debt for control, highly structured or direct equity investments
-Typically targets out-of-favor industries or distressed companies
-Value creation through industry recovery, strategic engagement and
operational improvement
Special situations
-Structured investments
-Toehold positions with potential for control
-Low creation multiples and attractive entry items
Real assets
-Value creation through both current income and asset value appreciation
-Employ reasonable financial leverage
-Balance between stability from long-term contract and upside from market
pricing actions

NEW YORK, March 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- WL Ross Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:   WLRH) announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Nexeo Solutions Holdings, LLC ("Nexeo Solutions" or the "Company"), a leading global distributor of chemicals and plastics and provider of environmental services, from TPG, a leading global alternative asset firm. As part of the transaction, TPG will roll over a substantial portion of its existing equity and retain approximately 35 percent ownership. The anticipated initial enterprise value, including fees and expenses, is $1,669 million, implying a multiple of 8.4x the Company's estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ending December 31, 2016.








Nexeo Solutions, based in Houston, TX, is the No.1 plastics distributor and No. 3 chemicals distributor by revenue in North America. Through its exceptional distribution network in key end markets, Nexeo Solutions provides value-added services and a diverse array of product offerings, allowing it to provide customers with a one-stop-shop resource for their chemicals and plastics needs. Nexeo Solutions distributes products that are used in a broad cross section of manufacturing end markets, including household, industrial and institutional, lubricants, performance coatings (including architectural coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers), automotive, healthcare, personal care, and construction. The Company generated revenues of $3.9 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Nexeo Solutions operates in more than 80 countries employing more than 2,450 people in 170 locations.
Upon completion of the transaction, WLRH will change its name to Nexeo Solutions, Inc., and will apply to continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbols NXEO, NXEOU, and NXEOW. TPG will continue to be represented on the board of directors of Nexeo Solutions. In addition, the board of directors will consist of members of the existing board of directors of Nexeo Solutions as well as other qualified individuals; Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. will serve as Chairman. The current Nexeo Solutions management team, headed by David Bradley, is expected to continue to lead Nexeo Solutions, Inc. following the consummation of the merger.
Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., Chairman of WLRH, said, "We are pleased to partner with TPG to introduce Nexeo Solutions as a publicly listed company. Over the last two years, we have evaluated a number of potential acquisitions for WLRH and we believe this opportunity offers a superior option for our shareholders. Nexeo Solutions presents a unique opportunity to invest in an industry-leading company supported by strong business fundamentals and long-term structural growth trends. Additionally, we believe the Company is an ideal platform to further roll up the fragmented chemicals and plastics distribution space, creating significant value for shareholders. We look forward to our partnership with the Nexeo Solutions management team as we work with them to further capitalize on these attractive growth prospects." 
"This transaction allows us to align our ownership structure in a way that accelerates our progress towards defining distribution," said David Bradley, President and CEO of Nexeo Solutions. "With a strong, centralized operating platform and access to multiple sources of capital, I believe we will be positioned to grow organically and through acquisition." 
"It has been our privilege to work with Nexeo Solutions' management since our acquisition of the business from Ashland Chemical in 2011 to build a world-class distribution platform poised for further growth," said Christopher Yip of TPG. "We look forward to remaining a significant owner of the business and a value-added partner to the company as it enters this new phase of growth."
Key Transaction TermsUnder the terms of the definitive agreements for the transaction, at closing, WLRH will acquire Nexeo Solutions in exchange for up to 35 million shares of WLRH common stock (as adjusted for deferred purchase price consideration) plus $1,296 million in cash and assumed net debt for a total consideration of $1,646 million (which includes fees and expenses), assuming a $10.00 per share valuation for the shares of WLRH common stock. In addition, WLRH's sponsor will exchange its warrants for 2.24 million shares of WLRH common stock (a 0.10 share per warrant exchange ratio). The cash portion of the consideration will be partially financed by debt facilities that have been committed to by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Jefferies Finance LLC, an affiliate of Jefferies LLC, and Deutsche Bank. 
As part of the transaction, the aggregate stock ownership of TPG and the other sellers will be capped at 35% of the value of the capital stock of WLRH. If that cap applies and WLRH does not otherwise satisfy the remaining purchase price in cash at closing, TPG and the other sellers will receive the remaining purchase price through future deferred payments in cash in lieu of receiving additional shares. Those deferred cash payments will have a value that is linked to WLRH's stock price. Also, as part of the transaction, it is expected that a portion of the 12.5 million founder shares originally issued to WLRH's sponsor will be allocated to TPG and other sellers in approximately the same proportion to the capital stock of WLRH allocated to TPG and such other sellers. The 12.5 million founder shares will be subject to forfeiture on the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the transaction unless, prior to such date, (i) the last per share price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period equals or exceeds $12.50 per share with respect to half of the founder shares and $15.00 per share with respect to the other half of the founder shares, or (ii) if WLRH completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of its stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for consideration or in which WLRH is the surviving entity but which results in a change in the majority of our board of directors, management team, or shareholders. The holders of the founder shares will also be subject to transfer restrictions until the trading price thresholds set forth above have been satisfied. These shares and the shares received by TPG from the sale of Nexeo Solutions will be restricted from trading for 180 days following completion of the transaction. As part of the transaction, WLRH will also enter into a tax receivable agreement with TPG and the other sellers, which will provide for the sharing of tax benefits relating to pre-business combination tax attributes of Nexeo Solutions and tax attributes generated by the acquisition between TPG and the other sellers and the company as those attributes are realized by the company.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by both board of directors of WLRH and Nexeo Solutions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to all requisite regulatory approvals, and approval of the stockholders of WLRH.
Lazard acted as sole M&A advisor, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as equity capital markets advisors to WLRH. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP provided legal counsel to WLRH. Jefferies LLC was financial advisor to Nexeo Solutions and TPG, and Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as counsel to TPG and Nexeo Solutions.

Ross, Jr., Chairman of WLRH, will be hosting the call to describe the transaction in further detail.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "estimate", "plan", "outlook", and "project" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements include statements concerning the proposed merger, Nexeo Solutions's estimated and future results of operations, competitive position, and roll up strategy. These forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. As a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections. 
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, or will be, instituted against WLRH, Nexeo Solutions, or other parties to the merger agreement following announcement of the merger agreement and transactions contemplated therein; the ability of WLRH to meet NASDAQ listing standards following the mergers and in connection with the consummation thereof; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of WLRH or other conditions to closing in the merger agreement; the failure to obtain the necessary financing arrangements set forth in the debt commitment letters delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; risks that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement of the merger agreement and consummation of the transaction described therein; costs related to the proposed mergers and the impact of the substantial indebtedness to be incurred to finance the consummation of the mergers; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the ability of the combined Company to meet its financial and strategic goals, due to, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined Company to grow and manage growth profitability, maintain relationships with suppliers and adequate supply of products and retain its key employees; the possibility that the combined Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, competitive factors, weather and/or commodity prices; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by WLRH and Nexeo Solutions.

Investors and security holders of WLRH are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement, and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement in connection with WLRH's solicitation of proxies for its stockholders' meeting to be held to approve the mergers because the proxy statement will contain important information about the mergers and the parties to the mergers. The definitive proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders of WLRH as of a record date to be established for voting on the mergers. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement, without charge, once available, at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: WL Ross Holding Corp., c/o WL Ross & Co.

While we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating Nexeo Solutions, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA as presented for financial reporting purposes herein, although similar, is not the same as similar terms in the applicable covenants in Nexeo Solutions's ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility or its senior subordinated notes or as defined by any other company in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA projected for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016 is expected to be calculated by adding back to net income net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax; interest, net; taxes; depreciation and amortization; management adjustments associated with integration, restructuring and transformational activities; foreign exchanges (gains) losses, net; management fees; compensation expense related to management equity plan (non-cash); transaction and other one time items; and adjustments associated with discontinued operations.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

Wilbur Louis Ross Jr. (born November 28, 1937) is an American investor and government official who is the current United States Secretary of Commerce. On November 24, 2016, the Associated Press reported that President-elect Donald Trump would nominate Ross to be United States Secretary of Commerce.[2][3] On February 27, 2017, the Senate confirmed Ross as United States Secretary of Commerce by a margin of 72-27.[4] He was sworn into office on February 28, 2017.
Before he was appointed as Secretary of Commerce, Ross was a banker known for restructuring failed companies in industries such as steel, coal, telecommunications, foreign investment and textiles. He specializes in leveraged buyouts and distressed businesses. In February 2017, Forbes magazine reported that Ross has a net worth of $2.5 billion.[1] He is often called the "King of Bankruptcy" because of his experience in buying bankrupt companies, primarily in the manufacturing and steel industries, and later selling them for a large profit after operations improve.[5]

Early life[edit]
Ross was born on November 28, 1937[6] in Weehawken, New Jersey,[6] and grew up in suburban New Jersey. His father, Wilbur Louis Ross Sr., was a lawyer who later became a judge, and his mother, Agnes (née O'Neill), was a school teacher.[6]
Ross drove two hours a day from New Jersey to attend the Catholic college preparatory Xavier High School in Manhattan. He ran track and was captain of the rifle team. He received his bachelor's degree from Yale College, his father's alma mater. At Yale, Ross edited one of the literary magazines and worked at the radio station. Initially, he wanted to be a writer, but after his experience in a fiction class requiring 500 words daily, he concluded that he had "run out of material." His faculty adviser at Yale helped him get his first summer job on Wall Street. He earned his MBA degree at Harvard Business School.[7]
Career[edit]
Rothschild Investments[edit]
In the late 1970s, Ross began his 24 year career at the New York City office of N M Rothschild & Sons, where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice.[6][8]
Representation of investors in casinos owned by Donald Trump[edit]
In the 1980s, Donald Trump was in financial trouble because of his casinos in Atlantic City. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under foreclosure threat from lenders. Ross, who was then the Senior Managing Director of Rothschild Inc., represented investors in the casino. Along with Carl Icahn, Ross convinced bondholders to strike a deal with Trump that allowed Trump to keep control of the casinos.[8][9]
Establishment of WL Ross & Co.[edit]
In the late 1990s, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. In 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to buy out the fund from Rothschild and make further investments in distressed assets.[6] The new firm was named WL Ross & Co.[8][6] Staff included four top managers who, along with Ross, make up the firm's investment committee: David H. Storper, who runs trading; David L. Wax, a longtime workout specialist; Stephen J. Toy, an Asia expert; and Pamela K. Wilson, a J.P. Morgan & Co. veteran.[7] WL Ross & Co. was acquired by Amvescap (now Invesco) in 2006.[10] In August 2016, Ross agreed to reimburse investors $11.8 million and pay a fine of $2.3 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into the overcharging of fees by WL Ross & Co. The company had self-reported the issue to the SEC and did not admit any liability.[11]
Investments[edit]
International Steel Group (ISG)[edit]
In 2002, Ross founded International Steel Group after purchasing the assets of several bankrupt steel companies. Ross had support of the local steelworkers union, negotiating a deal with them to "save" Pennsylvania's steel industry.[7] Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers union stated about Ross that "he was open and accessible and candid and honest and he put a lot of money back into the mills, so literally tens of thousands of jobs were saved."[12] Ross sold International Steel Group to Mittal Steel Company for $4.5 billion, half in cash and half in stock, in April 2005.[13]
International Textile Group (ITG)[edit]
Ross combined Burlington Industries and Cone Mills in 2004 to form International Textile Group. ITG operates five businesses, all of which operate under separate brand names: Cone Denim, Burlington Apparel Fabrics, Home Furnishings, Carlisle Finishing and Nano-Tex. In 2005, Ross purchased 77.3% of Safety Components International for $51.2 million.[14] In 2006, Ross merged the firm into his International Textile Group.[15] In February 2014, Ross paid $81 million to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders that Ross breached his fiduciary duty when structuring the merger of two companies that he majority-owned: Safety Components International Inc. and International Textile Group Inc.[16] International Textile Group was sold to private equity firm Platinum Equity in 2016.[17]
International Automotive Components Group (IAC)[edit]
International Automotive Components Group was formed in 2006 by Ross and investment funds managed by Franklin Mutual Advisers.[18] In 2006, International Automotive Components Group purchased the European operations of Lear Corporation.[19] In 2005-2007, IAC purchased several divisions of Collins & Aikman.[20] In September 2005, investors led by Ross made a $100 million investment in Oxford Automotive in exchange for approximately 25% of the company.[21] In 2006, Oxford merged with Wagon Automotive.[22]
International Coal Group (ICG)[edit]
Ross founded the International Coal Group in 2004, which was formed after several coal companies went bankrupt. The United Mine Workers of America protested the bankruptcy reorganization as it led to changes in health care and pensions for the existing employees.[23]
The Sago Mine disaster was a 2006 explosion in a coal mine indirectly owned by International Coal Group that led to the deaths of 12 miners. Federal investigators said a lightning strike was the most likely ignition source for the blast.[24] Following the disaster, the New York Post's Roddy Boyd reported that the mine had 12 roof collapses in 2005, and that the U.S. Department of Labor data showed 208 citations for safety violations in that same period, including 21 times for build-up of toxic gasses.[25] Miners and their families accused Ross of ignoring safety violations. Ross defended his company's management of the mine.[26] Arch Coal purchased International Coal Group for $3.4 billion in 2011.[27]
Political activities[edit]
Ross was raised as a Democrat.[28] He served under U.S. President Bill Clinton on the board of the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. Later, under New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Ross served as the Mayor's privatization advisor.[29] In January 1998 he put $2.25 million in seed money into the campaign of his then-wife, Betsy McCaughey Ross, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York.[28] Although he was an early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Ross was previously a registered Democrat, served as an officer of the New York State Democratic Party, and held fundraisers for Democratic candidates at his apartment in New York City. Since at least 2011, Ross has been donating to Republican candidates and organizations. He became a registered Republican in November 2016.[30]
Political views[edit]
On the subject of foreign trade, Ross has said: "I am not anti-trade. I am pro-trade, but I'm pro-sensible trade. [Being anti-trade] is a disadvantage of the American worker and the American manufacturing community."[28] Ross has also said that the government "should provide access to our markets to those countries who play fair, play by the rules and give everybody a fair chance to compete. Those who do not should not get away with it -they should be punished."[28] Initially in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ross has said that after examining the agreement, he found it was "not consistent with what was advertised."[28]
Organizational memberships and directorships[edit]
Ross is a hall of fame member and past director of the Turnaround Management Association.[31] Since 2014, Ross has been the vice-chairman of the board of Bank of Cyprus PCL, the largest bank in Cyprus.[32]
As of January 2012, Ross was the leader (or “Grand Swipe”) of the secret Wall Street fraternity, Kappa Beta Phi.[33] He served on the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.[34] He is also on the board of advisors of Yale School of Management. He donated $10 million for the construction of Evans Hall at the Yale School of Management.[35]
Secretary of Commerce[edit]




Secretary Wilbur Ross addresses to employees on March 1, 2017






Ross in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 2017


On November 24, 2016, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ross would be nominated for United States Secretary of Commerce by incoming President Donald Trump. The Trump transition team confirmed Trump's intent to nominate him on November 30, 2016. On February 27, 2017, Ross was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 72–27 vote.[36]
In May 2017, Ross accompanied Trump on his first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia. In an interview on CNBC, Ross said "there was not a single hint of a protester anywhere there during the whole time we were there."[37] Saudi Arabia banned protesting after the 2011 Arab Spring, and dissenters face the death penalty.[38][39]
In 2017, Ross said that agreeing to a trade deal with the United Kingdom was a low priority for the Trump administration.[40]
Honors[edit]
In 1999, Ross was awarded the Order of Industrial Service Merit medal by South Korea's President Kim Dae Jung for his assistance during the 1998 Korean financial crisis.[41]
Ross began working with Ireland and Irish-American causes starting in 2011 with an investment in the struggling Bank of Ireland. In recognition for his efforts on November 6, 2014 Ross was awarded the American Irish Historical Society Gold Medal at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The medal is awarded to "individuals who make an especially meritorious contribution to Irish American Life".[42][43]
Ross was awarded the medal of the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star by Japanese Ambassador Sumio Kusaka on behalf of the Japanese government at Kusaka's New York residence on February 2, 2015.[44] This was in recognition for strengthening the bonds between Japan and the USA (including his service as Chairman of the Board of New York's Japan Society, which had begun in 2010 after being on its board of directors since 2005), his work to promote and strengthen the Japanese economy, and his relief efforts after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[45][46]
Personal life[edit]
Ross married Judith Nodine in 1961. They divorced in 1995.[47] Together, they had two children, Jessica and Amanada.[48] In 1995, he married his second wife, New York Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey. They divorced in 2000.[7][47] On October 9, 2004, Ross married his third wife, Hilary Geary, a society writer for Quest magazine.[49]
Art collection[edit]
Ross owns an art collection valued at $150 million that includes pieces ranging from Western surrealists to contemporary Eastern sculptures.[50] Ross owns 25 works by René Magritte, valued at $100 million, including some of the artist's most valuable paintings such as The Pilgrim.[50]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

There is no evidence that more regulation makes things better. The most highly regulated industry in America is commercial banking, and that didn't save those institutions from making terrible decisions.
Wilbur Ross


Decisions,
America,
Better



















It's important to have a sound idea, but the really important thing is the implementation.
Wilbur Ross


Important,
Sound,
Idea
























My wife Hillary sometimes accuses me of trying to reinvent the 19th century. In some ways she's right because I like things that I can understand and that aren't too complicated.
Wilbur Ross


Wife,
Trying,
Me



















The one term I don't like to be called is a 'vulture.' Because to me, a vulture is a kind of asset-stripper that eats dead flesh off the bones of a dead creature. Our bird should be the phoenix, the bird that reinvents itself, recreates itself from its ashes. And that's much closer to what it is that we really do.
Wilbur Ross


Bird,
Me,
Kind



















I think it's natural for any manager to want to grow his business. The question is at what rate, and in what direction, and in what format?
Wilbur Ross


Business,
Direction,
Want



















I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with a bank being big. In fact, there are some good arguments about universality of geography that in theory, if you have all your eggs in one little community, and some big employer goes out, that could be your downfall.
Wilbur Ross


Good,
Community,
Think



















Banking, I would argue, is the most heavily regulated industry in the world. Regulations don't solve things. Supervision solves things.
Wilbur Ross


World,
Banking,
Most



















Shipping has a great oversupply of vessels that came from over-ordering a few years back. We think 2014 may be when it turns around.
Wilbur Ross


Great,
Think,
Back



















You cannot just keep borrowing more and more and keep spending more and more without eventually having a day of reckoning.
Wilbur Ross


Day,
You,
More
























Shale gas, if left to flourish, could create several hundred thousand more jobs.
Wilbur Ross


Create,
More,
Left



















I think at the end of the day, the real sick man of Europe is liable to turn out to be France, not Greece, not Portugal, not Spain, not Italy. The reason is France is very uncompetitive to begin with on a global scale, and the measures that Hollande has been putting in have been very, very negative from the point of view of economic growth.
Wilbur Ross


Growth,
Man,
Day



















Each weekend I play at least one and maybe two sets of tennis a day. My doubles team was in the finals recently at my tennis club in Palm Beach and lost a tiebreaker after a three-hour match. I must confess, by the end of the three hours, I was relieved it was over.
Wilbur Ross


Beach,
Team,
Day



















Ships are a strange kind of commodity because they're very lumpy, very big individual units, but they're commodities.
Wilbur Ross


Strange,
Kind,
Ships



















Everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing. Tariffs are the last thing. Tariffs are part of the negotiation. The real trick is going to be increase American exports. Get rid of some of the tariff and non-tariff barriers to American exports.
Wilbur Ross


American,
Negotiation,
Real



















The fact that you're successful doesn't mean that you can't relate to working people.
Wilbur Ross


Successful,
People,
Working
























I see myself as a private-equity investor that helps rebuild companies. Restructuring is a cottage industry in that there aren't that many serious practitioners.
Wilbur Ross


Myself,
See,
Serious



















Generally speaking, companies get into bankruptcy as a kind of meritocracy. Somebody made some sort of big mistake, to get into bankruptcy, and very often, a part of the mistake is too much leverage.
Wilbur Ross


Mistake,
Kind,
Leverage



















Between the Community Redevelopment Act, requiring banks to make what I would call very weak loans, and specific quotas that the Congress imposed on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that created the market demand that really led to the subprime phenomenon.
Wilbur Ross


Community,
Act,
Weak



















The typical big Japanese company has somewhere between a third and 40 percent of its revenues coming from developing countries, and about a third of Japan's exports are also to the emerging countries, so in a strange way, Japan, which has very little internal growth, its big companies are a good way to play the emerging markets.
Wilbur Ross


Good,
Growth,
Strange



















The fundamentals are the U.S. is going to end up being a net exporter of natural gas. That's going to be wonderful to help our balance of payments, reduce our dependence on a lot of countries that aren't so crazy about us, and change many, many parts of what goes on here.
Wilbur Ross


Change,
Balance,
End



















If you want to do something to destroy consumer spending, just eat away at the middle class because the other problem we have is the structural problem of middle class America.
Wilbur Ross


America,
Problem,
Want



















Mexico has 44 treaties with other countries that make it very advantageous to do international shipping from Mexico rather than from the United States. Believe it or not, Mexico has better treaties with the rest of the world than the United States does.
Wilbur Ross


World,
Believe,
Better
























The problem with regional trade agreements is you get picked apart by the first country. Then you negotiate with the second country. You get picked apart. And you go with the third one. You get picked apart again.
Wilbur Ross


Problem,
You,
Country



















Many of the smaller banks have had to get to the point where they now have more compliance people than they have lending offices. That's crazy.
Wilbur Ross


Crazy,
People,
More



















Part of the reason why I'm supporting Trump is that I think we need a more radical, new approach to government - at least in the U.S. - from what we've had before.
Wilbur Ross


Government,
Why,
Think



















If you add up all the promises any politician makes, the math doesn't work. Hillary Clinton's math doesn't work; Donald's math probably doesn't work. I think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic, more as metaphors.
Wilbur Ross


Work,
Promises,
Think
