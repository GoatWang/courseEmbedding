FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.


Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
