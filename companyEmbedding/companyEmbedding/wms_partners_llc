We are large enough that we provide exposure to many unique ideas and strategies in the investment, estate, tax, financial advisory and risk management arena; but small enough to provide discreet individualized guidance.

At WMS Partners we define wealth management by these core values:

Objectivity
We always strive to eliminate conflicts of interest that could interfere with our advice to clients.  Consistent with client interests, we are a fee-only, independent advisor and our allegiance rests with our clients. We are compensated only by our clients and not by any financial incentives from product providers.
Client Focused
The small number of significant relationships we serve allows us to truly focus on each client and establish intimate, long-term relationships.
Creativity
We seek out the most creative solutions to help our clients achieve their goals.  Innovative solutions for clients always trump a cookie cutter approach.  This is reflected in our private alternative investment strategies, our estate tax planning concepts, our client reporting and our multi-generational approach toward families.

Comprehensiveness
Our approach is holistic and we strive to become the “Chief Financial Officer” to our clients.  Our duty is to serve our clients’ best interests, and we treat each client’s issues as if they were our own.
Families
With rare exceptions, our clients are individuals and families, not institutions.  Our core strength is in advising high net worth families on the wide range of financial issues that impact them.  Our advice is customized and tailored to the client’s needs and is based upon a relationship founded on shared values and mutual respect.
Teamwork
We surround the client with a team of professionals perfectly suited to meet the needs of each relationship.  By allowing the employees of WMS Partners to work with a diverse group of clients, partners and relationship teams, we build stronger professionals.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

You Grew It, Now What? 
















We'll Help Find the Right Path  for You and Your Family






Lasting Values
We understand that, once your needs are met, the primary goals relate to your children and grandchildren and their value systems. How do we create a world for our children and grandchildren that has safety nets but no hammocks?


Security
Life will produce bumps. Minimizing the bumps is the goal, but how we react to those bumps is what defines us.


Innovative Solutions
There is no "one size fits all" solution to investing or planning. We provide creative solutions tailored to you, not to the masses.


Opportunities
The creation of wealth can be a long and arduous journey.  The opportunities that result deserve your attention.  We have the experience and creativity to manage your financial life so your time and energy can be focused on making a difference for your family, your lifestyle or your philanthropy.


Giving Back
Creating good stewards of wealth is as much about the pleasure of giving back to the world we live in as it is maximizing our own lifestyles.


Eliminate Complexity
Investment, estate and tax planning don't need to be overwhelming.  We'll help you simplify your choices.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE INFORMATION
WMS Partners, LLC (“WMS”) is an SEC registered investment adviser located in Towson, Maryland.  WMS and its representatives are in compliance with the current filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisers by those states in which WMS maintains clients.  WMS may only transact business in those states in which it is registered, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration requirements.  WMS’s web site is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links.  Accordingly, the publication of WMS’s web site on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as WMS’s solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet.  Any subsequent, direct communication by WMS with a prospective client shall be conducted by a representative that is either registered or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration in the state where the prospective client resides.  For information pertaining to the registration status of WMS, please contact the SEC or the state securities regulators for those states in which WMS maintains a notice filing.  A copy of WMS’s current written disclosure statement discussing WMS’s business operations, services, and fees is available from WMS upon written request.  WMS does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to WMS web site or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefore.  All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Please remember that different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that the future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy (including those undertaken or recommended by WMS), will be profitable or equal any historical performance level(s).
Certain portions of WMS’s web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, WMS (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date.  Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s).  Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from WMS, or from any other investment professional.  WMS is neither an attorney nor an accountant, and no portion of the web site content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice.
Rankings and/or recognition by unaffiliated rating services and/or publications should not be construed by a client or prospective client as a guarantee that he/she will experience a certain level of results if WMS is engaged, or continues to be engaged, to provide investment advisory services, nor should it be construed as a current or past endorsement of WMS by any of its clients.  Rankings published by magazines, and others, generally base their selections exclusively on information prepared and/or submitted by the recognized adviser.
Each client and prospective client agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/its access to WMS’s web site, to release and hold harmless WMS, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of his/her/its receipt of personalized individual advice from WMS.
