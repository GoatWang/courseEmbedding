“I had the advantage of both genetics and upbringing. As I looked around at those who did not have these advantages, it became clear to me that I had a moral obligation to direct my resources to help repair that inequity.” 
– George B. Kaiser












A LETTER FROM GEORGE KAISER
I suppose I arrived at my charitable commitment largely through guilt. I recognized early on that my good fortune was not due to superior personal character or initiative so much as it was to dumb luck. I was blessed to be born in an advanced society with caring parents. So, I had the advantage of both genetics (winning the “ovarian lottery”) and upbringing. As I looked around at those who did not have these advantages, it became clear to me that I had a moral obligation to direct my resources to help right that balance.
No child is responsible for the circumstances of his or her birth.
I have therefore developed my charitable focus around the concept of providing the greatest opportunity for self-fulfillment for each child, focusing on those who arrive in the least advantaged circumstances. That governing concept has led us to those initiatives which attempt to reverse the generational cycle of poverty, especially for very young children and their families: prenatal health care; early learning and development for at-risk kids, birth to three; family health care; parenting training; job and income assistance for families with young children; operating a robust program to provide alternatives to incarceration for mothers who have committed non-violent crimes; and other initiatives.
My family joins me in my intention to devote virtually all of my financial resources to these same general charitable purposes. We have also chosen to focus these efforts in the community that welcomed my family from Nazi Germany. By doing so we hope to pursue the best approaches, drawing from the experience of others, and make a measurable impact.
If we can be successful, then maybe we will more closely approach the ideal of equal opportunity throughout the United States and the world.

ABOUT GEORGE KAISER






George B. Kaiser is president, CEO and primary owner of GBK Corporation, parent of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company, which he has managed for almost 50 years. He is chairman of the board and majority owner of BOK Financial Corporation and a major shareholder in a number of diversified businesses in North America and overseas. He continues to work full time with these enterprises while also offering counsel to GKFF. Mr. Kaiser attended Tulsa Public Schools and earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966.
Mr. Kaiser plans to contribute his remaining net worth to GKFF in life and through his estate. He developed the Foundation’s primary focus as equal opportunity for young children, which GKFF pursues through the evidence-based and experimental programs described elsewhere on this site. That mission derives from the belief that it is profoundly unfair and inconsistent with America’s founding principles for the accident of birth to determine a child’s potential. The unifying theme of the Foundation is that “no newborn child bears any responsibility for the circumstances of her birth and yet her future chance for success in life is heavily influenced by those circumstances.” The Foundation’s civic ventures are designed to advance its primary mission while also adding to the diversity and vibrancy of the Tulsa area.

HEALTH & FAMILY WELL-BEING




OVERVIEW
GKFF’s work in this area attempts to reverse the generational cycle of poverty, especially for very young children and their families, through programs focused on pre-pregnancy and family health care, teen pregnancy prevention and alternatives to incarceration for mothers who have committed low-level offenses.










Oklahoma incarcerates more women per capita than any other state in the nation. 










An 11-year discrepancy in life expectancy exists between the highest- and lowest-income ZIP codes in Tulsa.










Oklahoma has the second-highest rate of teen pregnancies among teens ages 15 to 19.






“Children bear no responsibility for the circumstance of their birth and are often the most impacted by poor health outcomes in their families, limiting their opportunity to escape from intergenerational poverty. That is morally offensive.”

— George B. Kaiser





INITIATIVES
The best way for young children to succeed is through a strong and healthy beginning. GKFF partners with nonprofit organizations to provide a level playing field, ensure access to necessary services and alleviate the symptoms of poverty, including food, clothing and shelter insecurity.









 
Community Health

In a state with some of the country’s worst health outcomes, GKFF has sought best practices to combat Tulsa’s significant health challenges. The Foundation invests in evidence-based practices and interventions dedicated to serving low-income populations.

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]

He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]

In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]

ABOUT GEORGE KAISER






George B. Kaiser is president, CEO and primary owner of GBK Corporation, parent of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company, which he has managed for almost 50 years. He is chairman of the board and majority owner of BOK Financial Corporation and a major shareholder in a number of diversified businesses in North America and overseas. He continues to work full time with these enterprises while also offering counsel to GKFF. Mr. Kaiser attended Tulsa Public Schools and earned his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966.
Mr. Kaiser plans to contribute his remaining net worth to GKFF in life and through his estate. He developed the Foundation’s primary focus as equal opportunity for young children, which GKFF pursues through the evidence-based and experimental programs described elsewhere on this site. That mission derives from the belief that it is profoundly unfair and inconsistent with America’s founding principles for the accident of birth to determine a child’s potential. The unifying theme of the Foundation is that “no newborn child bears any responsibility for the circumstances of her birth and yet her future chance for success in life is heavily influenced by those circumstances.” The Foundation’s civic ventures are designed to advance its primary mission while also adding to the diversity and vibrancy of the Tulsa area.

Early life[edit]
Kaiser was born on July 29, 1942 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[1][2][6] He attended Central High School in Tulsa.[7] He earned a B.A. from Harvard College in 1964 and an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1966.[8] He briefly considered joining the U.S. Foreign Service, but instead returned to Tulsa in 1966 to work for his father. Kaiser-Francis Oil Co. was created in the 1940s by Kaiser's uncle and parents, Jewish[9][10] refugees from Nazi Germany who settled in Oklahoma.[11][12]
George's father, Herman had been a judge in Germany until 1935, when he was removed from his job by the Nazis because he was Jewish. He and his wife escaped to England in 1938, then emigrated to the United States. They settled in Tulsa, where Herman's aunt and uncle already lived. Herman joined the uncle's oil drilling business. Their son was born in Tulsa.[6] Herman died in Tulsa on October 14, 1992 at the age of 88.[13]
Career[edit]
Oil and gas[edit]
George Kaiser took control of Kaiser-Francis Oil Company in 1969, after his father had a heart attack. Kaiser-Francis was a little-known, privately owned oil prospecting and drilling company at the time. Under George's management, it became the 23rd largest nonpublic energy exploration company in the U.S. by 2010. In that year the company earned about $217 million, based on estimates by Bloomberg News.[14]
Banking[edit]
In 1990, Kaiser bought Bank of Oklahoma out of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation receivership. Despite BOK's depressed state, it was rich enough to land Kaiser on the Forbes 400 at one stroke. He has since expanded BOK from a 20-branch company located solely in Oklahoma into a $23.9 billion bank with operations in nine states. It is the 23rd largest bank holding company in the U. S.[8] He owns 61.5 percent of BOK.[14] As of 2007, Kaiser's ownership interests in BOK were worth $2.3 billion. In 2008, with an estimated current[update] net worth of around $12 billion, he was ranked by Forbes as the 20-richest person in America and the richest person in Oklahoma. In March 2009, in the face of the general world economic downturn, Forbes reported that Kaiser's net worth had dropped to $9 billion, ranking him in a tie for 43rd-richest person in the world.[15] It has since risen to $9.8 billion as the markets recovered.[1]
Professional sports[edit]
In April 2014, Kaiser bought Tom L. Ward's interest in The Professional Basketball Club, the investment group headed by Clay Bennett that owns the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association, as well as its Tulsa 66ers minor league affiliate.[16]
Personal life[edit]
Kaiser's nephew is actor Tim Blake Nelson.[17]
Kaiser has been married twice:

His first wife was Betty Eudene. Betty was a prominent literacy advocate volunteering more than 7,000 hours with the Tulsa City-County Library's literacy program. Betty died in 2002.[4] The couple had three children: Philip, Leah and Emily. They also have five grandchildren: Shai, Eytan, Aidan, Ilan, and Ben.[4]
His second and current wife is Myra Block, who is a curator, authority on fiber art and founder of the Brady Craft Alliance.[7] daughter of Tulsa oilman and philanthropist, Charles Goodall,[7] known for establishing the small cities program on the Council of Jewish Federations.[18] The couple divides their time between Tulsa, Oklahoma, and San Francisco, California.

Kaiser typically works 70 hours a week in his office, spending half his time on philanthropy and the rest on banking, energy and other business interests.[7]
Kaiser is affiliated with Congregation B'Nai Emunah, the more conservative of Tulsa's two synagogues.[7]
Kaiser apparently values his personal privacy, for he avoids publicity, does not attend society functions and hardly ever gives interviews. While he owns homes in both Tulsa and San Francisco, he is said to own no vacation homes, airplanes or yachts.[7]
Philanthropy[edit]
Kaiser is listed third on BusinessWeek's 2008 list of the top 50 American philanthropists, behind Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.[19][20] Among his prominent causes is fighting childhood poverty through the George Kaiser Family Foundation; he is also a major benefactor to the Jewish community in Oklahoma, which numbers about 5,000 people.[11][21] He has been notably active in the promotion of early childhood education.[6][22][23][24] Kaiser's family foundation is also the largest contributor to the Tulsa Community Foundation, which Kaiser established in 1998 because of his perception that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 this foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the United States, and now has approximately four billion dollars in assets.[25][26][27][28][29]
Kaiser's family foundation funded the National Energy Policy Institute, a non-profit energy policy organization located at the University of Tulsa whose president since its inception is former Alaska governor Tony Knowles.[30] and whose director was former U.S. Representative Brad Carson.[31] In January 2009, Kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the Oklahoma House of Representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers.[32][33]
The foundation was instrumental in the funding of Tulsa's Woody Guthrie Center, which opened in 2013, and then in facilitating (together with the University of Tulsa) the acquisition in 2016 of Bob Dylan's 6,000-piece archive, which will be maintained by archivists at the university's Helmerich Center for American Research at Gilcrease Museum.[34]
Kaiser's family foundation was a large investor in the now-defunct Solyndra Corporation. The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

The company has revealed that the foundation invested $340 million in the venture in July 2009, and subsequently gave preferential consideration to a plant site proposed for an economically depressed area of North Tulsa. The plant was never built and Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in Fremont, California on September 6, 2011.[14]
Kaiser is among those who have made The Giving Pledge, a commitment to give away half of his wealth for charitable purposes.[35][36][37][38]
Kaiser's philanthropy focuses on stimulating economic growth and combatting poverty with investments in early education and health care for people who need it the most. He is a strong proponent of programs like Early Head Start and Educare. An article in Forbes quoted him as saying “Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.”[6]
The Kaiser foundation supports the training of teachers specializing in early education by donating $1.2 million per year to Tulsa Community College and Oklahoma University to fund training programs. It also reimburses the students' tuition if they work in Oklahoma for four years after graduating. The foundation has also brought at least 150 young teachers to Tulsa through the Teach for America program.[6]
Kaiser learned that poverty has a major effect on life expectancy. Before he became involved in funding health care, he was informed that there was a 14-year difference in life expectancy between children born in richest and poorest ZIP codes. Kaiser concluded that too few doctors were available to treat the poorer people. His foundation then donated $62 million to the University of Oklahoma to create a School of Community Medicine at its Tulsa campus. The money supplemented a $20 million donation by the Schusterman family. The grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community.[6]
Kaiser's philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is, ""Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose,"[7]
Political activities[edit]
A Wall Street Journal article reported in 2004 that campaign contribution records showed that Kaiser had donated $10,000 to Democratic Party political candidates for every $1,000 that he gave Republican Party candidates.[11]
Kaiser was a fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and functioned as a campaign bundler for Obama: an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate.[39] At one 2007 event for Obama, he raised more than $250,000.
An 2011 article by Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation analyzed Kaiser's business activities and his use of legal tax avoidance strategies, including how during the 1980s bust in the oil industry in Oklahoma and Texas, Kaiser bought up struggling energy companies whose losses provided him with tax deductions that effectively offset his own income and left him with little or no tax liability.[40][41]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

If you are born into poverty, the chances are good that your children will be born into poverty. Find a way to give poor kids the same cognitive stimulus that rich kids receive, and they should end up with the same tools for success.
George Kaiser


Success,
Children,
Good



















Rich, smart parents tend to have rich, smart kids - not because it's genetic but because they can create a home environment and sensory stimulation that lower-income kids often don't get.
George Kaiser


Home,
Parents,
Smart
























I prefer doing things rather than sitting around talking about doing things.
George Kaiser


Doing,
Talking,
Sitting



















Truly, learning appears to be a reverse geometric progression with experiences at one hour, one day, one month or one year dramatically more influential and formative than later experiences. As has often been quoted, 85% of brain development takes place by age 3, and yet we spend only 4% of our educational dollars by that point.
George Kaiser


Learning,
Age,
Day



















Those who have won the ovarian lottery by being born in an advanced society to loving parents have a special obligation to help restore the American Dream.
George Kaiser


Parents,
Society,
Help



















Naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement, yet more anonymous operational support may better advance the charitable purpose.
George Kaiser


Support,
Purpose,
Better



















America's 'social contract' is equal opportunity... yet we have failed in achieving that seminal goal.
George Kaiser


Opportunity,
Goal,
Achieving



















In the charitable world as in the business world, opportunities should drive budgets, not the other way around.
George Kaiser


Business,
World,
Drive



















During the desperate depression of the 1980s, there were no oil and gas companies without net operating losses.
George Kaiser


Depression,
Without,
Oil
























I suppose I arrived at my charitable commitment largely through guilt. I recognized early on that my good fortune was not due to superior personal character or initiative so much as it was to dumb luck.
George Kaiser


Good,
Character,
Commitment



















If you are doing what everyone else is doing, there is probably not an opportunity there.
George Kaiser


Opportunity,
You,
Doing



















Maybe the perceived fact that smart, rich parents tended to have smart, rich kids was largely due to the fact that they also tended to have stay-at-home moms or nannies who read to their kids, held them, put mobiles over their cribs, playing those annoying ditties, and sent them off for SAT training at six months.
George Kaiser


Training,
Parents,
Smart
