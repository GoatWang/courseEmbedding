Projections are very realistic


How realistic are the projections for an increase in nuclear power plants in the coming decades and what can the U.S. learn from the experience Europe has had with nuclear power?
In sum, very realistic. 

Our experience in the UK has shown that if you are seriously committed to a low-carbon, reliable and diverse energy mix, with the strictest modern safety measures, then you must consider nuclear energy. Nuclear power should be part of an energy mix that can meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.   

For this reason, we have backed an expansion of nuclear power, which has broad based political support. Based on a White Paper in 2008, we've put into motion the policy and investment wheels to reinvigorate the UK's nuclear energy industry.

We created the Office of Nuclear Development, dedicated to working with business to remove bureaucratic barriers and enabling investment in the UK from the earliest possible date, with no cap on the amount of new build. Further, by pricing carbon appropriately through our emissions trading scheme, we can expect investment from the industry to ramp up over the next decade.  Already we have seen significant investment interest from a number of British and international companies. Our first new nuclear power station is set to be operational by 2018.   

We recognize that waste, decommissioning and non-proliferation are serious issues for any country investing in a nuclear energy future. We will approve new power stations only if industry proposals can demonstrate they have effective arrangements for managing the waste they produce and funds to pay for the decommissioning.

The UK experience offers useful pointers for other countries. A number of our European partners are also looking at boosting their nuclear energy programs.  But, ultimately, every country has to design its own energy policy that balances considerations like energy independence, a greater reliance on clean energy and what is best for its economy.

I recall seeing Christie on PBS - former head of EPA saying Cheney came down and demanded she turn over her research maps showing serious temperature rise and flooding in the south.   
Recently I began wondering why Bush sought to liquidate the housing sector in 2002-  I think Cheney and Bush KNEW flooding would bring a crisis to US insurance sector and pop the housing sector anyway- figured they might as well get something for it - ALL the while DENYING it.
I also say - global warming is debatable, but all this flooding ? is not.  1/2 of Greenland's ice cap gone ? NOT debatable.
I saw the insurance sector on c-span two years ago with those very maps - stating coastal properties are costing them too much and they have to raise their premiums.
I find it peculiar, Countrywide had a high percentage of coastal mortgage policies.
I now question when Bush in 2002- when he came out of the blue saying 'forget the down payment, forget the fine print, just turn on Fox, where we're running our Countrywide and DiTech ads 24/7 - and go git your home, and remember, if you're not with us, yer a terrorist'. 
I recall those days VERY well.
Now it makes sense why bush would all of a sudden CARE about the African American communities when bush projected CRA pushed  mortgages should expand to 500 billion by 2010.  And they have.
Bush created inflation in housing, which was followed by deflation, in the meantime - Goldman and crew made out like bandits processing those phony loans.
Remember, Comptroller of Currency Dugan says Countrywide didn't GO to the banks- banks would have LAUGHED a ZERO down payment Bush arranged mortgage product out the door, they went to Wall Street.
All the while denying melting ice,  flodding, and now look - look at the south - the impact from flooding is going to CRUSH the US insurance sector.  2 years ago they had near 100 billion EXTRA in reserves to handle claims - with all this flooding ? 
That will be gone sooner than you can say - AIG really deserved the money it got to insure Goldman.
This was ONE clever FLEECING - Bush and family actually found a way to sell the LAND in America - keep the rewards for initial loans, and last I checked ? Bush is no where to be found in ANY press.
Don't forget - September 11th, no - not 2001, 2003- when Bush sought to control FAnnie and Freddie and take the WHOLE ball of wax.
http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2008/09/fannie-mae-new-york-times-rides-to.html
The closed door energy policy meetings by Cheney for Enron, TXU, Exxon, Exelon etc,  those were to assure final profits could be made.
Remember, if mean ole global warming is real - oil is a USELESS product- and we can't have that can we-  Coal is a USELESS product, possibly with LIABILITIES to the coal industry- can't have that either- therefore global warming isn't real... 
augh!
we've ALL been robbed, and kicked in the stomach by this former alleged 'administration'.  And where was the RUNOFF election in the US  ? We just had a private council of 7 people decide Bush 'must have won'. 
Is this REAL ? 
Is it ?

  Bottom line the "USA Establishment" is heavily invested into oil and coal and high prices in both are very good for THEM.
Carter was a agent of Standard Oil (and Coal).
 And solar and wind power is no competition.

I doubt Britain had to deal with as many crazy nut jobs as we do in the US.  Why couldn’t Harry Reid, Ralph Nader, Amory Lovin, and Ed Markey come from Britain and promote their anti-nuclear diatribe their?   The answer is the British electorate won’t put up with these types of anti-nuclear fear mongers.  In Britain they base their discussions on science not fear.  In fact they look at fear mongers as people who are bit mentally unstable.  They look at giving creditability to a fear monger as the same they would to following a crazy over a cliff.  If Lovins and Markey raised the same type of anti-nuclear rhetoric in Britain as they do here they would loose all creditability and be seen as the true nut jobs that they are. 
I am not saying that Britain does not have to deal with their own NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) factor.  But our US NIMBY’s have significantly more influence.  Our US judicial system will give standing to any NIMBY regardless of how ludicrous their argument is.  Even our own media be it CNN, FOX, the Washington Post, or Glenn Beck has a significant economic advantage to give a voice to any NIMBY who asks to be in the spot light.  It is preposterous, stupid, and inane to give credence to anyone that does not have sound science to back up their arguments.  But this does not stop our media from giving a stage and thus creditability to crazies like Nader, Lovins, and the other anti-nuclear fear mongers.  
What ever happened to the scientific editors?  Is it not the scientific editor’s role to fight the temptation of giving a voice to these fear mongers?  The sad fact is it is more important to have readers, viewers, and listeners than it is to preserve ones own media integrity.  Today’s scientific editors are seen as more of a hindrance to the bottom line than that of a liability.  I guess the quick buck wins over the public good once again.  
Let’s build 200 new nuke plants now and save the planet,

Press release
Sir Nigel Sheinwald appointed Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing









From:

Cabinet Office, Home Office, and The Rt Hon David Cameron

Part of:

Cyber security

Published:
19 September 2014





This was published under the 2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government


    The Prime Minister has appointed Sir Nigel Sheinwald as Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing.
  









Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former senior Diplomat and Ambassador to the US 2007 to 2012, has been appointed by the Prime Minister as Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing.
This role was announced by the Prime Minister when he set out the government’s plans to introduce emergency legislation to preserve data retention and investigation powers (the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act) in July 2014. At the time the Prime Minister said:

A number of overseas companies have asserted that their ability to work with the UK government is being severely constrained by international conflicts of jurisdiction. For example, where they think they have a British law saying that they should share data, and an American law saying that they shouldn’t. So we intend to appoint a senior diplomat to work with America and other countries to address these concerns and ensure that lawful and justified transfer of information across borders takes place to protect our people’s safety and security.

Sir Nigel’s overarching objective is to lead discussions with governments, other key international partners and Communications Service Providers (CPSs) on ways to improve access to and sharing of law enforcement and intelligence data in different jurisdictions. Sir Nigel will seek to identify ways to take forward the British government’s relationship with CSPs and explore how new formal arrangements could improve data access and sharing in both the short and longer term.
Sir Nigel will be based in the Cabinet Office and report to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, through the Cabinet Secretary.
Terms of reference
Sir Nigel Sheinwald: Special Envoy
The Prime Minister has appointed Sir Nigel Sheinwald, a former senior member of HM Diplomatic Service and Ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2012, as Special Envoy on intelligence and law enforcement data sharing. This role was prefigured during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act in July 2014.
Sir Nigel will lead discussions with the US government, other key international partners and the Communications Service Providers (CSPs) on ways to improve the accessing of this data in different jurisdictions. He will seek to:

identify ways to take forward the British government’s relationships with the CSPs and ensure that the British government’s work in this area is coherent with its broader relationships with the CSPs, and vice versa
explore how new formal US/UK arrangements could improve data access for the UK agencies
work with the US government and CSPs on a range of options for strengthening arrangements and ensuring reliable access, eg through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty systems, other legal or political  frameworks or remedies, better arrangements for direct requests from the UK agencies to the companies which hold the data, or other means
consider wider international arrangements in this area
ensure that any new arrangements observe the requirement that data is requested and provided only where necessary and proportionate for the purposes of national security and the prevention or detection of serious crime

    Innovia Group has appointed Sir Nigel Sheinwald GCMG as a non-executive director to enhance the group’s capability to support its continued international growth and expansion.   
Sheinwald will join the board of Innovia Group at the end of January 2015.
He was a career diplomat with the British Diplomatic Service between 1976 and 2012, serving as British permanent representative to the European Union between 2000 and 2003, the Prime Minister’s foreign policy and defence adviser from 2003 until 2007, and completed his diplomatic career as ambassador to the US between 2007 and 2012.
Following his retirement Sheinwald has established a portfolio of interests including being appointed as a non-executive director of Royal Dutch Shell, senior policy adviser to Universal Music Group and the Prime Minister's special envoy for intelligence and law enforcement data sharing.
