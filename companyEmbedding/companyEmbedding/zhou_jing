Jing Zhou
Founder
elemoon
Jing Zhou is a patent-holding Chinese entrepreneur based in New York. She is founder and CEO of elemoon, a wearable tech company for women. Its initial product is an elegant bracelet that does more than tracking your steps or display time. It also enables you to change its light design to match any outfit or occasion, to notify you with important calls and texts, and to help you find your phone. elemoon is featured in numerous US and international media, such as New York Times, ABC News, CNBC, Time Out, VICE, Us Weekly and Forbes China. It’s named “the best new invention” by MSN and “object of desire” by Time Out. Zhou’s team spans the globe—from New York and Los Angeles to Shanghai and Shenzhen. By encouraging female leadership and creativity, Zhou’s company has attracted top talent from Pixar, MTV and E! Entertainment.
Before taking on the nascent wearable industry, Zhou’s team developed a Chinese social app to help young women better communicate, support, and exchange gifts with one another. The app was featured by Apple and China’s most-watched business TV show, 30 Minutes.
Zhou also built and sold a mobile ad company, raising $4 million. She then invested in a number of startups founded by women. In 2010, she co-founded the China Chapter of Girls in Tech and spoke at the UN about how to build an ecosystem that supports female innovation.
Prior to her startup life, Zhou worked as reporter for BusinessWeek magazine and other B2B publications in the US. She received a U.S. visa for aliens with extraordinary abilities for her work. She also worked in the contemporary art industry in Shanghai, and managed international touring exhibitions in China and Europe.

Nu Skin’s products were the driving force behind Pei Zhang’s decision to become a Nu Skin distributor after she, her husband, Wen Long Gan, and their son immigrated to Canada. She tried the products after attending a presentation and she and her friends quickly noticed her results. She then learned the compensation plan, heard leaders’ success stories and decided to take action to begin her and Wen Long’s Nu Skin journey.
 
Pei believes that diligent use of the products is key to building a successful business. Her own strong belief in the products’ benefits has catapulted her and Wen Long to a rewarding lifestyle, and given them the ability to help others transform their lives—from how they look and feel to enjoying life with their own thriving businesses. She encourages distributors to remain positive, attend meetings and events, enjoy the journey, and act as a force for good.
 
Jing Jin and Jue Zhou were looking for an opportunity that would change their future, and they found it with Nu Skin. They soon learned that Nu Skin is a business of duplicating your actions, and that it is important for you to first demonstrate to your team actions to take to achieve the results you—and they—want. Jing and Jue say they have learned the power of love through their business—loving their family, their organization of customers and distributors and people in their community whom they help.
 
Creating a dream board to keep them focused on their goals was a vital part of Jing and Jue’s success, they say, along with continuing to learn, present and help their partners as they grew their organization. Today they give back by sponsoring Tibetan students to help them attend school and improve their futures, by helping with relief efforts during natural disasters in China and through finding new ways to help others.

HP offers a wide spectrum of innovative products to meet diverse customer needs. While this has helped the company achieve unparalleled market reach, it has come with significant costs and challenges. HP developed two powerful OR-based solutions for product variety management that address the diverse needs of its businesses throughout their products’ lifecycles. The first uses custom-built ROI calculators to evaluate each proposed new product before it is introduced. The second, HP’s Revenue Coverage Optimization (RCO) tool, is used to manage product variety after it has been introduced. By identifying a core portfolio of products most important to order coverage, RCO enables HP businesses to increase operational focus on the most critical products in their offerings. Using these tools, HP achieved over $500M in profit improvements across several business units since 2005. HP also streamlined its product offering, improved execution, achieved faster delivery performance, lowered overhead, and increased customer satisfaction and market share.Access the winning project’s companion paper
