Medication non-adherence is a big problem. It's a 290 billion dollar problem in the US annually. Fifty percent of us don't take medications as we should. So Orbis wants to take a lot of that error out of the hands of the patient, and put it back into the dosage form. We use precision particle fabrication to create particles that are very uniform and unique things. If you want to inject a particle, there's a certain optimal size. If you want to control the release rate for weeks or days, there's a certain optimal size. So on the left; you can see an example of Orbis' technology. On the right you can see particles made from the exact same material from a different manufacturing process. All the particles are different sizes, there's no sort of uniformity. You can deal with that later, you can sieve off some of the particles and try to find the right ones, but Orbis can actually do that from the very beginning. For kids, taste is one of the biggest problems, so we use this technology to mask the taste, so that you don't taste anything. We recently produced a four to five kilogram batch, and we have the capacity to create scales that are large enough to address clinical trial need right now. Pharmaceutical companies can leverage this technology to differentiate their products. Maybe they need to make it long acting, or there's a taste issue, or they need a new format. This allows them to introduce differentiated products into their portfolio. These are the things you can't do with other technologies.

About Taste Masking and Dosage Format Flexibility
There is a significant demand for taste-masked pharmaceutical formulations due to a large number of geriatric and pediatric patients who lack access to age-appropriate dosage formats. Upwards of 79% of children discharged from pediatric hospitals are prescribed one or more medications that are designed, approved, and intended for use in adults, underscoring the need for patient-specific formulations.1	The importance of providing safe, effective, and proven medicines for children has been continually cited as an area in need of improvement for pharmaceutical companies and the providers who administer their products.2 

However, the widespread lack of patient-specific drug products forces medical providers and pharmacists to use alternative solutions to treat their pediatric and geriatric patients that are not backed by key bioavailability, stability, and safety studies.3,4 Not only are these methods inconsistent, they often lead to dosing errors, decreased bioavailability or efficacy, and they suffer from non-adherence because of foul-tasting pharmaceutical actives.5 The lack of titratable and palatable formulations affects 40 percent of the global population, subjecting patients to avoidable adverse drug events, reduced compliance with medication regimens, limited access to new medications, and prolonged treatable illnesses.6
Current dosing regimens for pediatric and geriatric populations suffer because they fail to address the following critical aspects simultaneously:

Palatability. Many APIs are extremely bitter and coating efforts can result in an unpleasant mouth feel due to irregular surface features.7,8 Approximately half of children refuse to take their medicine, with the large majority of those reporting bad taste as the single major reason for non-compliance.6 Sweeteners alone are often unable to overcome the extremely unpleasant taste of many active ingredients. Moreover, efforts to mask flavors using coatings, agglomeration, or microencapsulation often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions that result in a gritty or granular mouth feel.8
Titratable dosing. Different ages, weights, and body mass indices require extreme dosing precision that is not linearly scaled. Medication errors are common in 6 percent of pediatric hospitalizations.9 Dose titration is critical; one-size-fits-all dosing is ineffective in children due to their developmental variability.6
Drug format. A wide variety of age appropriate formats (liquid, suspensions, chewable tablets, effervescent tablets) are needed.3 Up to one-third of children have difficulty swallowing tablets.4

    In the absence of patient-specific dosages – formulations that are both palatable (to ensure compliance) and titratable (to meet the weight/surface area-appropriate dosage needs from neonates to adolescents) – healthcare providers either: (i) prescribe adult-approved liquid formulations, or (ii) manipulate available products to create extemporaneous formulations (e.g., by crushing a tablet). Liquid suspensions, while titratable and largely preferred by children over tablets and capsules, are often poorly palatable and thus suffer from poor compliance. Extemporaneous formulations can alter the performance – including the palatability and bioavailability – of the original product and contribute to both poor compliance (only 70% compliance in hospitals)10 and increased risk for under- and over-dosing. Free-flowing, drug-loaded microcapsule powders would allow pharmacists to prepare highly palatable microcapsule liquid suspensions to accurately dose children of all ages.
    

About ORB-101
    Using optimμm™ technology, Orbis creates drug-loaded microcapsules that mask bitter flavors and allow for accurate dosing and the ability to process into a variety of dosing formats. The core-shell microcapsules contain prednisone-loaded cores. ORB-101 is a shelf-stable, microcapsule formulation of prednisone that is taste-masked, dose-titratable, and bioequivalent to the PredniSONE Intensol™ (5mg/mL) – the target Reference Listed Drug – when placed in suspension or used as a stand-alone solid dosage form.  These ~200 µm-diameter microcapsules exhibited minimal release in simulated oral cavity conditions (< 5% drug released within 2 min) followed by near-complete release within 30 minutes (>90% release by 30 min in simulated gastric conditions). Optimµm technology enables the creation of a shelf-stable, prednisone-loaded microcapsule-based powder that will significantly outperform the reference listed drug (predniSONE solution USP, 5 mg/mL) in terms of palatability while maintaining bioequivalence to it.

ORB-202
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), Ménière's disease

 






About Inner Ear Diseases
New medicines are needed to better treat the millions of Americans affected by debilitating diseases of the inner ear, including sudden sensorineural hearing loss, autoimmune inner ear disease, tinnitus, and Meniere’s disease.1-6 There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat these diseases, forcing physicians to administer – both systemically and locally – off-label, ad hoc formulations of drugs that lack evidence-based safety and efficacy data. Current approaches to local delivery of therapeutics to the inner ear offer either high control of dose levels or low administration costs - but not both. This significantly limits their commercial viability and the potential to improve patients’ lives as the market demands drugs that are safe, efficacious, and cost-effective.


There are two approaches to deliver steroids that are used in current clinical practice: (i) oral and (ii) intratympanic injection. Orally-delivered steroids offer patients convenience and low cost. Physicians, working within the confines of current medical reimbursement paradigms, often use oral steroids as a first line treatment for common otic disorders.6 In order for a physician to be reimbursed for intratympanic steroid use (Current Procedural Terminology code 69799), a patient must often have a documented inability to tolerate oral steroids or have at least 1 week of hearing loss with no improvement after oral steroid therapy. Oral steroids are typically dosed at high levels (40mg per day for up to 14 days followed by 5 day taper) to achieve significant concentration of the drug within the perilymph fluid of the cochlea.7,8 Oral steroid treatment has shown some level of effectiveness in the treatment of steroid-responsive disorders. However, treatment is generally limited to short durations (1-2 weeks) due to the significant negative side-effects of systemic steroids.9-12 It is also unclear if, and to what extent, systemic steroid treatment results in sufficient concentrations of steroid in the inner ear. Systemic steroid exposure can cause significant side-effects, and is thus a less preferred option than local de-livery to the cochlea.13


Compared to systemic delivery, intratympanic delivery of steroid to the inner ear offers the ability to deliver high concentrations of steroids to the inner ear for longer periods of time. The rationale for intratympanic injections is that they might allow for higher concentrations and longer durations of drug exposure within the inner ear and could, therefore, result in improved clinical outcomes.  Current clinical practices rely on ad hoc formulations of steroids that have produced inconsistent clinical results.  For example, a placebo-controlled study of the intratympanic dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) for the treatment of Meniere’s disease reported substantial improvement of vertigo symptoms (82% versus 57% placebo control).14 However, a similar randomized, double-blind study showed intratympanic dexamethasone did not improve symptoms compared to placebo (saline and sodium hyaluronate).15


These inconsistent clinical outcomes could be attributable to the pharmacokinetics of the steroid within the inner ear.  Indeed, increasing the dose from 4 mg/mL to 12 mg/mL can improve the control of symptoms in Meniere’s disease. This 2-year longitudinal study showed that sustained levels of steroid in the perilymph could significantly improve outcomes for patients as 91% of patients reported “acceptable” vertigo control after 1 to 3 injections of 12mg/mL dexamethasone.16  A 2006 study in which the intratympanic injection dose was increased to 24mg/mL of dexamethasone resulted in patients reporting 95% control of vertigo symptoms.17 Taken together, there is clinical evidence to support the hypothesis that increased concentrations of steroids in the inner ear can improve treatment outcomes.


Based upon this clinical data, we developed ORB-202 in order to demonstrate that providing steady-state steroid levels in the perilymph cochlea fluid for no less than 30 days will overcome these challenges and provide significant clinical benefits.


About ORB-202
As the first therapeutic to use Unisun™, ORB-202, will eliminate the need for physicians to prescribe off-label use of high concentrations of oral steroids or ad hoc formulations of suspended steroids that they deliver through intratympanic injection. While both systemic (via oral dosages) and local (via intratympanic injection) delivery of steroids to the inner ear have been a common practice in the ear, nose, and throat medical community for some time,1-4 there has yet to be definitive, clinical-based evidence as to the utility of this approach to improve patient outcomes. Regardless of the route of administration, off-label use of steroids is problematic for a number of reasons including:

Lack of both clinical and scientific-based understanding of the appropriate steroid concentrations to achieve a therapeutic effect in the inner ear
Insufficient pharmacokinetic data to determine the appropriate dose, leaving patients at risk for both under and over dose
Lack of safety data, leaving patients exposed to unnecessary risks that could potentially worsen their hearing
Minimal clarity on the appropriate treatment duration, which further contributes to the potential risks


Orbis has developed ORB-202 to deliver therapeutic concentrations of steroids to the inner ear for more than 4 weeks after a single, intratympanic injection. This represents a significant improvement over current clinical practices that rely on multiple intratympanic injections, spaced several days apart, for the treatment of otic disorders that are steroid-responsive.5


An example of this common procedure, performed by Dr. Chris Chang of the Fauquier Ear Nose and Throat Consultants of Virginia, can be viewed online. Notice that the patient must lay their head to the side for approximately 30 minutes to allow for the steroid to diffuse through the round window membrane (RWM).  As soon as the patient sits up right, or swallows, the steroid solution will run down the estuation tube and be ingested, an undesirable effect that limits the amount of time that the drug is in contact with the RWM.  In contrast, ORB-202 will adhere steroid-loaded microspheres to the RWM in less time (~10 minutes after injection) and will remain for a minimum of 4 weeks, thereby allowing for controlled release of steroid to the inner ear for prolonged periods of time from a single, convenient intratympanic injection.

Microparticle controlled release delivery systems | Orbis Biosciences







































HomeAbout UsFoundersLeadership TeamAdvisorsThe Orbis DifferenceTechnologyPrecision Particle FabricationPlatformsUnprecedented ControlUnparalleled ScalabilityFAQsR&D PipelineBlogFor FunContact us













Medication non-adherence is a big problem. It's a 290 billion dollar problem in the US annually. Fifty percent of us don't take medications as we should. So Orbis wants to take a lot of that error out of the hands of the patient, and put it back into the dosage form. We use precision particle fabrication to create particles that are very uniform and unique things. If you want to inject a particle, there's a certain optimal size. If you want to control the release rate for weeks or days, there's a certain optimal size. So on the left; you can see an example of Orbis' technology. On the right you can see particles made from the exact same material from a different manufacturing process. All the particles are different sizes, there's no sort of uniformity. You can deal with that later, you can sieve off some of the particles and try to find the right ones, but Orbis can actually do that from the very beginning. For kids, taste is one of the biggest problems, so we use this technology to mask the taste, so that you don't taste anything. We recently produced a four to five kilogram batch, and we have the capacity to create scales that are large enough to address clinical trial need right now. Pharmaceutical companies can leverage this technology to differentiate their products. Maybe they need to make it long acting, or there's a taste issue, or they need a new format. This allows them to introduce differentiated products into their portfolio. These are the things you can't do with other technologies.


Delivering Precision


Orbis Biosciences optimizes oral and injectable pharmaceutical products for improved compliance.


Our proprietary technologies provide customized drug release, format and dose flexibility, and taste-masking for oral drugs.
