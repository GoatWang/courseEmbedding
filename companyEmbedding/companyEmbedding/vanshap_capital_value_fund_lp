April 30, 2015 Dear Partner: The Vanshap Capital Value Fund, LP returned -1.5% net of fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2015, compared with 1.0% for the S&P 500 and 2.3% for the MSCI World Indices. 

Hellenic Opportunity 

Nathan Mayer Rothschild, the London-based family member of the eponymous banking dynasty, famously suggested that “The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.” We observe that the roads in Athens currently have a distinctive crimson sheen. Since the start of the political turmoil at the end of last year, we have made a substantial investment in Greek equities, now amounting to 17% of Fund assets. Among the headlines declaring a “Grexit” all but inevitable, we see substantial opportunity. The Cyclically Adjusted Price to Earnings (CAPE) ratio of the Greek equity market is currently just two, the lowest in the world to our knowledge, and one-third the multiple of Russia and Hungary. Considering the relative stability of democracy in the country, we suspect such a valuation reflects the consensus view that Greece’s exit from the Eurozone is the likely result. While not an infallible strategy, purchasing equity securities in countries with low CAPE ratios has historically generated exceptional returns over the ensuing decade. As individual securities analysts ourselves, we have assembled a handful of what we believe are high quality, well-managed businesses trading at exceptionally attractive valuations. Negotiations between Greece and the Eurozone have undoubtedly been lengthy and contentious. We, however, continue to believe an agreement will eventually be struck—not only because the alternative could have dire consequences, but because recent polls indicate the Greek populous desires to remain in the currency union—regardless of the cost. While the quoted prices of our securities will fluctuate based on the deluge of headlines surrounding the process, we think fundamental analysis and rationality will return to the market over time 

Top 5 Holdings – March 31, 2015 

Company Country Market Cap (M$) % of Fund % of Company 

Detrex Corporation U.S. $47 10.8% 9.7% Character Group U.K. $106 9.5% 3.8% Public Service Properties U.K. $38 7.0% 7.7% Grivalia Properties Greece $827 6.0% 0.3% Kicking Horse Energy Canada $126 4.7% 1.5% 



























 

2 and we are confident the valuations of our holdings will more properly reflect the intrinsic value of those enterprises. 

The Portfolio 

The largest detractors from performance in the quarter were 

Detrex Corporation (OTC: DTRX)

 and

 Kicking Horse Energy (CN: KCK)

. The largest contributors were

 Character Group (LON: CCT) 

and

 Village Main Reef (SJ: VIL)

.

 

The share price of Detrex Corporation has been significantly pressured, presumably driven by a rather poor fourth quarter earnings result and lack of progress in the search for strategic alternatives. While revenues did not change materially from the prior year, profitability declined largely due to unfavorable product mix. Additionally, costs increased due to higher investments in manufacturing and product development, and expenses stemming from regulatory compliance. The good news is that these investments appear to now be generating a return. In late April, the company announced first quarter revenues increased by 7.4% over the prior year and net income improved by 32%. Also in late April, we were appointed to the company’s board of directors to represent our significant investment and the interests of all stakeholders. Please note that all comments regarding Detrex Corporation will continue to be restricted to publicly available information. We look forward to assisting management and the board in their effort to “evaluate and embrace strategic opportunities to generate shareholder value.” Kicking Horse has been greatly impacted by the steep decline in the price of crude oil. We recently spoke with CEO Steve Harding who confirmed the company has no desire to squander its valuable petroleum resources and has therefore slashed development expenditures. Of the two rigs that were drilling for the company at the start of the year, one was indefinitely released in January and the other in mid-February for spring break-up, but is likely to return later in the year. With modest debt levels and relatively low development costs, we expect Kicking Horse to be a survivor, even in a prolonged downturn, and to thrive once again should crude prices return to higher levels. The growth of Character Group continued to settle into the market in the quarter, resulting in a higher share price. We took the opportunity to modestly reduce our ownership in the company after significant appreciation and increased, although minimal, investor excitement. The shares are still valued at only 9x estimated FY2015 cash earnings. Management continues to believe the share price does not accurately reflect the intrinsic value of the company, and has therefore been repurchasing shares opportunistically in the market. Orders for the upcoming holiday season will begin later this summer and news until then is likely to be minimal. 

Village Main Reef (SJ: VIL)

 is slated to come to an end. As we noted in our last letter, the company received multiple offers for both individual assets and the entity as a whole and a financial adviser had been retained to manage a formal solicitation process. In early February, the board announced the company would be acquired by Heaven-Sent, one of the 
























 

3 largest private equity/venture capital firms in China—for 1,225 rand, noticeably below our estimated fair value of 1,500 rand. Through subsequent conversations, we learned that capital expenditures to extend the life of the Tau Lekoa gold mine would be higher than we had believed. We expect the transaction to close within the next month or so, though we have been reducing our position in the meantime. Over our roughly two-year holding period, we lost about 30% of the capital we invested in Village Main Reef, a disappointing result. While roughly half the loss is attributable to the significant depreciation of the South African rand, we nonetheless made numerous analytical errors. First, as we have noted in prior letters, we drastically underestimated the liabilities that would ultimately stem from the closure of the Buffels and Blyvoor mines in a lower gold price environment. Second, we should have been far more wary of what turned out to be a single asset commodity company, operating in a highly volatile geography, rife with strikes and other turbulence. Lastly, and relatedly, we should have more carefully considered investing in a small South African resources company, regardless of the optically low valuation. Last quarter, we wrote that 

Public Service Properties Investments Ltd. (LON: PSPI)

 was “inching closer to liquidation.” In the first quarter, the company took a giant leap toward dissolution. In mid-February, the board agreed to sell the troubled U.K. assets to tenant Embrace for only £34.5 million. The sales price was at a significant discount to the stated net asset value and far below what we believed would be the ultimate value of the portfolio. The alternative was less appealing than we thought; a £4 million upgrade of the properties with two or three years required for operational turnaround, without any guarantee of an exit. After concluding that the incremental return for assuming the risk was meager, we voted to approve the disposal. The result of our investment in Public Service was poor. In our second quarter 2013 letter, we told you we estimated the conservative net asset value to be 41p per share. Assuming the renewal of domiciliary care contracts in Liverpool, we expect to receive just 29p per share in total proceeds. Over the two year holding period, we will have earned virtually nothing after accounting for currency depreciation. In hindsight, we believe the initial investment thesis was reasonably sound, but that the allocation was far too large. We had closely analyzed the negotiating position of the company versus the tenant at the time, and concluded that while not overwhelmingly strong, the existence of alternative operators would result in an acceptable outcome for the assets. The amount of capital required and the risk associated with those alternatives grew over time and ultimately proved unpalatable. We expect the five remaining German care homes, which are in relatively good shape compared to the U.K. properties, to be liquidated over the coming months. In the interim, the board executed a compulsory stock redemption, effectively returning £16 million to shareholders—equivalent to about 60% of the market value. Thus, Public Service has been reduced to a 3% position in the Fund and will hopefully be nonexistent by year-end. We recently met with 

Second Cup Ltd. (CN: SCU)

 CEO Alix Box and Interim CFO Sandra Clarke at headquarters and believe the company has made significant progress over the last
