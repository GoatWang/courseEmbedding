 Business Editors  JACKSON, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 18, 2000  Electronic Design and Manufacturing Service (EMS) provider, Sparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA), elected David P. Molfenter to the Sparton Board of Directors at its December 18, 2000 meeting.  Mr. Molfenter's election fills the vacancy created by the recent death of Mr. John J. Smith, Chairman Emeritus.  David P. Molfenter was recently the Vice President and General Manager of the Communication Systems Division of the Raytheon Company. This division, headquartered in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, with major operations in six locations throughout the United States, is a $1 Billion business focused on providing cost effective communication solutions across the battlespace and for commercial satellite-based applications.  Mr. Molfenter's experience in the defense and communications industries will provide a strong and extensive base for the strategic direction of Sparton Corporation. Employed with Magnavox Electronic Systems Company (MESC) for 28 years, his extensive background in engineering and management elevated him to President and Chief Executive Officer. After the acquisition of MESC by Hughes Aircraft Company in December 1995, Mr. Molfenter was appointed Vice President of Hughes Aircraft Company and President of Hughes Defense Communications. In December 1997, following the merger of Raytheon Company and Hughes Aircraft, Mr. Molfenter was appointed to his recent position with Raytheon.  Mr. Molfenter is a native of Cincinnati, Ohio. He received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Cincinnati and holds masters degrees in electrical engineering and business administration from Purdue University and Indiana University, respectively.  Sparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA) now in its 101st year, provides high mix, low to medium volume electronics contract manufacturing services utilizing six manufacturing locations encompassing over 700,000-sq. ft. along with ten alliance partner facilities throughout North America and Europe. In addition to strong core surface mount technology (SMT) and plated through-hole (PTH), printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and complete assembly manufacturing capabilities, Sparton offers a complete range of pre-manufacturing and post-manufacturing services. Pre-manufacturing services include product development, concurrent engineering, design for test (DFT), design for manufacturing (DFM), design for assembly (DFA), printed circuit board design and quick-turn prototyping. Post-manufacturing services range from repair depot, direct ship, distribution management to field support.  For further information, please contact Rhonda Aldrich, Sparton Corporation at (517) 787-8600 or visit the Sparton website at http://www.sparton.com/.
