Greetings and welcome to the Acacia Communications Second Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Monica Gould, Investor Relations for Acacia Communications. Thank you, Ms. Gould. You may now begin.
Monica Gould
Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Acacia Communications released results this afternoon for its second quarter ended June 30, 2016 after market close. If you did not receive a copy of our earnings press release you may obtain it from the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.acacia-inc.com. This call is being webcast live and replay will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me on today’s call, are Raj Shanmugaraj our President and Chief Executive Officer; John Gavin, our Chief Financial Officer; and Benny Mikkelsen, our Chief Technology Officer and Founder.
Before I turn the call over to Raj, I'd like to note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements based on the business environment as we currently see it and as such does include certain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release and our SEC filings for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the projections described in today’s discussion.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, we report certain financial measures that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance. Reconciliations between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in the table found in today's press release.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Raj.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our first earnings call as a public company. For those of you new to Acacia I’d like to start out with a brief overview of the Company, the markets we serve and our growth strategy. Following the overview, I will discuss our recent achievements and then turn it over to John Gavin, our CFO who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance and outlook.
Acacia’s mission is to deliver high-speed optical interconnects that transform, cloud, content and communication networks. We have developed a family of high-speed interconnects that leverage our own Digital Signal Processor or DSP ASIC and silicon based Photonic Integrated Circuit or PIC. Our DSP ASIC has over a billion transistors and our PIC collapses over 50 photonic functions, significantly reducing the cost and size of optical interconnects.
Our products enable industry-leading speed, density, and power efficiency. This level of innovation and integration is only possible because we have developed both our DSP ASIC and PIC in silicon. This siliconization causes disruption at multiple levels, but primarily helps Web 2.0 content providers and traditional service providers build fiber-optic networks at lower cost, while increasing network capacity substantially to meet the bandwidth demand for video, mobile, cloud computing and other high bandwidth drivers like IoT.

Our family of standard interconnect modules can be easily integrated into traditional network equipment like DWDM boxes as well as routers, data center switches or custom equipment being built by the Web 2.0 content providers. Our modules reduce the overall cost and complexity of building and managing high speed networks. We offer 100 gigabit per second and 400 gigabit per second products today and are working on products that enable speeds up 1 terabit per second and more.
The market opportunity we are targeting is large and growing. The growth in bandwidth demand has caused an increase in investments across long-haul, metro and inter-data center networks with most of that investment focused on speeds up 100G and higher. With the growth of large data centers and content moving closer to the consumer, we are seeing strong demand for our products across metro and inter-data center networks.
Geographically, we are seeing demand across all regions while demand from China is particularly strong. Our customer base has grown from eight customers in 2011 to more than 25 customers in the first half of 2016. We have seen substantial increases in customer revenue in the past four years from our original eight customers. They have increased both the volume and the number of products they purchased from us. And we believe, we will see similar increases from our newer customers going forward.
Our growth is being driven by strong global demand from metro and inter-data center network buildouts. We believe that the industry is in the early stages of a multi-year buildout cycle of 100G, 200G and 400G technology. These buildouts are happening in long-haul including submarine and in metro and inter-data center networks.
In the second quarter, we saw a step function increase in demand driven by deployments in all of our growth markets. We started to see this demand increase beginning late in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter which enabled us to achieve a revenue growth rate of 91% year-over-year in the first half of 2016. We expect similar growth to continue into the second half of 2016.
During the second quarter, total revenues grew to $116.2 million, an increase of 101% year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in sales of our 100G CFP digital coherent optics or CFP-DCO products as well as the ramp of our new 400G product family. At the same time, we recorded non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of $28.9 million compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2015.
These results demonstrate the strength of both our business and operating leverage in our model. We continue to lead the industry in delivering next generation products is our CFP-DCO shipments which in the second quarter exceeded 8,000 units. Also as we previously reported, we began sampling our CFP2 Analog Coherent Optics or CFP2-ACO in the first quarter of 2016.
In 2016, we began to see the majority of our revenues shift from long-haul to metro and inter-data center applications. We also continue to make progress on diversifying our revenue base. For example, the second quarter two of our newer Tier-1 customers who are not in our original group of eight customer substantially increased their spending with us and moved up on to the top five customer group as they ramp their inter-data center and metro buildouts.
Our second quarter highlights also include the completion of our IPO in which we raised $97.8 million in net proceeds. And we added Vincent Roche, CEO of Analog Devices to our Board. Vincent brings a wealth of industry knowledge and experience, which further enhances the public company leadership capability of our Board.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong financial performance and our ability to quickly scale to meet growing customer demand. Our success is a testament to the strength of our disruptive technology and execution from our talented employees. We have built a unique multi disciplinary team which provides us a significant competitive advantage in solving the optical interconnect problem.

We are also very excited about the many opportunities ahead of us and the magnitude of the tectonic shift we believe we are driving in the industry. Our disruptive technology has already started to transform cloud, content, and communication networks and we feel this is just the beginning. We planned to continue to invest in our R&D organization to introduce additional market leading products.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John for a more detailed review of our financial performance and our outlook for the third quarter.
John Gavin
Thanks, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. As Raj mentioned I am John Gavin, CFO of Acacia and today I will walk you through our financial and operating performance for the second quarter of 2016 and will provide our outlook for the third quarter before opening up the call to questions. We are excited to report our first quarter as a public company, and I am very pleased that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations across the Board.
Total revenue of $116.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 rose 101% from revenue of $57.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. This growth was driven by continued strong global demand for metro and inter-data center network buildouts with particularly strong demand from the China market.
Thanks to the efforts of our operations in R&D teams, we are able to ramp additional production capacity to meet the strong customer demand. We saw increased demand for products that contain a vertically integrated silicon PIC technology and we have scaled our production capacity to better meet that demand. In particular, we saw increased demand for our metro focused 100G CFP DCO and our 400G inter-data center focused products.
We continue to execute on our objective to diversify our revenue base, revenue from customers outside our original eight customers grew 120% year-over-year and 117% sequentially compared to 96% year-over-year and 25% sequential growth for our original eight customers.
Non-GAAP gross margins rose to 47% in the second quarter of 2016 from 35.3% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase is primarily due to the continued shift in our revenue mix to products that contain our vertically integrated silicon PIC technology combined with our progress on transitioning our manufacturing to lower cost regions during the second quarter. We also began to ramp our 400G products which utilize our silicon PIC technology.
Our gross margin can fluctuate based on quarterly product mix, the introduction of new products and the impact of pricing changes. Over the long-term we expect non-GAAP gross margins to improve driven by further vertical integration into our silicon building blocks and our ongoing focus on reducing manufacturing costs. Over the long-term, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be in line with our long-term target range of 48% to 50%.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $22 million or 19% of revenue compared to $11.6 million or 20% of revenues during the second quarter of 2015. R&D expenses totaled $16.5 million or 14% of revenue compared to $8.7 million or 15% of revenue in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to a increases in personnel costs and cost that support our next generation silicon development for both DSP ASIC and PIC technology.
We expect fluctuations in our quarterly R&D expenses due to the timing of silicon development costs and the associated development expenses to prototype and qualified new technology developments. We continue to invest in our technology roadmap and we are making progress with the roadmap products that will come to market during the 2017 and 2018.
SG&A expenses were $5.5 million or 4.8% of revenue compared to $2.9 million or 5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2015. We continued to add to our sales and marketing efforts to support new and existing customer growth and in the second quarter we expand that our direct sales force with sales engineering support and customer facing resources. We also have increased our G&A resources to address the additional scale of our business and to meet the requirements of being a publicly traded company.

We plan to continue to expand our R&D and SG&A organizations as we scale the business to support the many growth opportunities ahead of us. Over the long-term we expect non-GAAP R&D and non-GAAP SG&A to increase as a percentage of revenue to be in line with our long-term target range of 20% to 22% and 6% to 9% respectively. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $32.6 million or 28.1% of revenue up from $8.8 million or 15.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP results exclude $9.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. Due to the step function increase in our revenue during the second quarter. Revenue growth far exceeded our ability to scale our planned investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Over the long-term we expect our non-GAAP operating margins to be in line with our long-term target range of 20% to 24%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $34.7 million in the second quarter, up from $9.8 million in the second quarter of 2015. Driven by our expanded gross profit on the year-over-year incremental revenue and the operating leverage inherent in our business model. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 11% down from 30% in the second quarter of 2015.
A principal international operating entity continue to make progress in the second quarter. In addition, we have achieved our initial objectives of establishing our operations in Ireland and having our team there be a critical aspect of our global customer and operations support model. Over the long-term we expect that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be in line with a long-term target range of 10% to 15%.
Overall we recorded non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of $28.9 million or 24.9% of revenue compared to $6.1 million or 10.5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2015. Based on a fully-diluted weighted average share count of 37.4 million shares this translates to non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.77 per share. We expect that non-GAAP net income as a percent of revenue will be in line with our long-term target range of 18% to 22%
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $159 million, which included net proceeds from the IPO of $97.8 million and we have no debt. We generated $31 million of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We are very encouraged by the continued strong demand for our products across our customer base coming out of the second quarter which provides us with good visibility to our business in the third quarter.
This ongoing demand is led by the same market drivers we saw in the second quarter namely growth driven by continued strong global demand from metro and inter-data center network buildouts with customers of our legacy products now migrating to our next generation silicon PIC products.
With that, I would like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter of 2016. As Raj previously stated we achieved year-over-year growth of 91% in the first half of 2016. We expect to see similar growth continue into the second half of 2016 with some history of seasonality in the fourth quarter.
With that being said, as noted in our earnings release in the third quarter of 2016. We expect total revenue to be between $120 million and $128 million. Non-GAAP net income to be in the range of $26 million to $31 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $0.64 to $0.76 per share based on anticipated 40.8 million diluted shares outstanding.
In wrapping up my comments, the second quarter was an exciting and busy quarter for Acacia all across the Company. We exceeded our financial and operating expectations and strengthened our balance sheet to the completion of our IPO. We see continued strength in the major demand drivers of our business and believe they are well positioned to take advantage of those growth opportunities.

I will now turn the call back to Rob to open up the call for questions, after which Raj will wrap up with some summary remarks.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Vijay Bharadwaj with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
Vijay Bharadwaj
Yes, thanks. Hi, Raj, John. Solid results here. Congratulations to your team. My question is help us – give us an anchor on how we should look at end market growth and demand which would help us to better model the business into next year, so you mentioned strength in metro and also in data center interconnects. Give us any numbers, any quantitative feel you can on those end markets and then that would help us to better model the business heading into next year? Thanks.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So Vijay, I'm going to take a crack at it and have Benny also add to it. So if you look at the market segments that we participate in which is the long-haul, and the metro, and the inter-data center markets. And we talked about this a little bit in our S1. It’s a little complicated to model it exactly, but collectively these three according to ACG are over $11 billion in 2015 moving to over $20 billion in 2019. And so these are growing, but these are customer network equipment revenue numbers and not specifically our addressable state.
But if you look at our addressable states within theirs, we share a significant portion of the inter-data center markets where our products play pretty well and we also have a good participation in the metro markets. And so if you look at just our own addressable market is in the $4 billion to $5 billion and growing is what we can say. So it is a little dynamic, it is a little difficult to model exactly because it’s multiple markets product segments and we sell into the service providers – equipment providers space, which participate in that and our addressable market is a little lower than those numbers.
Vijay Bharadwaj
Perfect. A quick follow-up for John. John on sales OpEx, in OpEx overall how should we think about it through the rest of the year? Would you be allocating OpEx for these cloud customers like dedicated sales force because you're seeing strength there obviously? Thanks.
John Gavin
Sure, Vijay. In terms of overall operating expense, we're only – we're not guiding out for the follow-on quarters. But in terms of just overall direction, we wouldn't necessarily per se dedicated sales resources. What we're doing is we’re supplementing our teams with both customer technical support resources and incremental customer facing resources.
So there isn't really a notion of having dedication in our sales structure, but we are making investments there as you see our business is scaling quite rapidly. So we're making those associated adjustments over time to scale up those organizations, but not really in a mode of dedicating a specialty sales team if you will. It’s just augmenting the resources that we have.
Vijay Bharadwaj
Excellent. Yes, thank you again and solid results.
John Gavin
Thanks, Vijay.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj

Our next question is coming from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your questions.
Alex Henderson
Some quarter guys. Couple of simple stuff. Can you just give us the ending headcount?
John Gavin
Yes, Alex. This is John. Thank you for your comment, ending headcount was 233 at the end of Q2.
Alex Henderson
And on the tax rate just quickly, I know you're planning on having it come down to 12, but how rapidly does that trend down?
John Gavin
So the tax rate Alex, we're in the early aspects of the establishment of the restructuring that we did back in starting in Q4. So we'll see that rate fluctuate a little bit over time, but as you saw the non-GAAP rate was 11% for the quarter. So we're going to move up and down a little bit variably in the tax rate as that structure settles in and becomes more steady state over the period of time. But you can think about it in that 10% to 15% range for sure is what we've given for guidance.

Alex Henderson
Okay. One question on the technology side. Can you give us some sense of where you are testing the ACO product with other people's DSP other than your own? And how long do you think that that will take to reach fruition, so that we can get some sense of the timing of that?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So Alex I'll take a crack at it and then I’ll let Benny extrapolate on it. So as you know we sampled the ACO back early in the first quarter and we've gone after a few select opportunities in terms of testing it out and so that's the phase we are in. If you look at our own projections, we [plant ramping] this product late in the year in Q4. And if you look at the total revenue projections the ACO is not a material portion of the revenue at this stage. And maybe Benny you want to add to it?
Benny Mikkelsen
Yes. First before answering the question, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Benny Mikkelsen, I’m CTO and Founder of Acacia. So as Raj pointed out, we started sampling our ACO in late first quarter this year, but with the plant ramping – and I think in North Hemis Acacia is uniquely positioned to participate in both ACO and DCO market.
And as Raj pointed out we shipped more than 8,000 DCO modules through this year and consequently shipping a lot more DCO than ACOs. And we also believe that 2017 the DCO market is expected to be significantly higher than the ACO market is also an agreement we like counting. However, we can't speak - make specific customer big announcement, but we see good traction on ACO and we believe this is also going to be an important part for our next year.
Alex Henderson
If I could just ask one last question, you obviously had a lot of conversations with people out of China. Can you give us some sense of where you think people are in China with respect to new RFPs that could be left in the remainder of the year and update us on where ZTE is relative to the issues around that government issue? Thank you.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. So Alex, again as you heard in some of the other calls, China is in a cycle of a multi-year expansion of 100G, 200G and 400G started out late last year with the backbone network from one carrier namely China Mobile that went through all through the Q1 and into Q2.
We are seeing more activity in the provincial networks of China Mobile as well it's not going to be as we the backbone, but it’s going to be significant and we see activity happening in those networks through the second half of this year and to the first half next year. We're also hearing about the tenders from the other two carriers China Unicom Telecom as well. And so in the near-term we see the 100G, 200G expansion happening in those three carriers.
Now as some alluded as well there's the 13 five-year plan from the Chinese government that was released, that talks about the expansion of broadband all the way from the access to the backbone from 2016 to 2020. That's should cover through the midterm of the expansion. And again as they are adding more access capacity, adding more mobile capacity we see this is a multi-year expansion and so we're in the early innings of that. So that's part one of the question you asked.
In terms of ZTE, as you know ZTE is consistently one of the top five equipment providers in the world and we're happy to have them as a big customer of ours. As they've demonstrated, they're working through the U.S. Commerce issues and we believe that they're going to put the issues behind them and looking forward to working with them as we move forward.
Alex Henderson
So nice super size opportunity there. Thank you.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Thank you, Alex.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.

Tal Liani
Hi guys. I have more ZTE specific questions and also gross margin. What was the contribution of China I'll just shoot a few questions and then we can discuss what was the contribution of China this quarter percentage wise? And then did you provide your number one customer, what was the contribution also percentage? I know you provided growth with original eight customers versus others because of the issues with ZTE I'm trying to isolate ZTE.
And then another question on ZTE was entering the quarter you had backlog of $30 million you disclosed it before attributed specifically to ZTE. Did you draw on this backlog or did it go up this quarter?
And final question is about the gross margin. The gross margin this quarter we see similar behavior of Q1 where there was a growth in proportion of DSPs that drove up the gross margin. It's about a year early on the plan and I'm wondering how should we think about the gross margin? What drove the increase in the gross margin? And is it sustainable? Are you seeing the benefits of what you were supposed to see next year?
Are you seeing the benefit this year? Or is it mostly because of higher proportion of DSP that is temporary and should reverse back and then grow next year for the reasons you highlighted before. Sorry, I know many questions in different directions, but I just wanted to bring this up.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So we will try to address one by one Tal although you may have to repeat the last couple. But on the - let's start with the ZTE and the contribution. So if you look at what we had in the 10-Q ZTE as you know in Q1 was pretty large 46% revenue and that was because of the backbone buildouts. And then in Q2 they dropped down to 31%, so it's lower, so we had the other customers move up.
In terms of backlog we see continued strong backlog as well from ZTE going into the rest of the year. So we don't see a whole lot of slowdown. If that's what you're getting at in terms of backlog coming from ZTE or growth prospects for them in terms of expansion. So just jumping into the gross margin I'm going to take a little crack at it and turn it over to John.
Gross margin as you pointed out depends on multiple factors, it depends on our own vertical integration which includes the mix shift of our replacing our legacy products with more or vertically integrated PIC products. It also involves shipping DSPs but and of course we are moving to a low cost region in terms of CM.
And I would say that we are not near the top of any of those transitions yet we've had a mix of those where we've done a little bit of all of those things and I'm going to let John expand on that. But it is something that has moved in because of the mix shift but I think there's still additional opportunities we see.
John Gavin
Sure. Thanks Raj. So I think to add a little bit more color to what Raj was saying in gross margin I think for sure in the second quarter versus the first quarter. The incremental revenue that we saw that was really coming pretty much 100% from the PIC base products. So as you know we're getting a much better gross margin there because of the integration into our PIC technology that was one factor.
Also Q2 was really the first quarter where we really did a big pivot and shift of our contract manufacturing moving that out from North America and into the far east lower cost regional contract manufacturing plants that also gave us another bump in gross margin.
So I think you know as I said in my remarks, we'll have some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter in our gross margin. I don't see it being in wide fluctuation points like maybe you would see between Q1 and Q2, but certainly factors like second half pricing now start to kick in from a pricing perspective and those types of things will impact our margin.

So I think where a little ahead of where we would be in terms of our plans for gross margin expansion which is good, but I wouldn't expect that it's going to be substantially higher than that going forward.
Tal Liani
So just a follow-up on your last comment. That means I mean all the reasons you noted are basically next year reasons that are being materialized now. So that means we should not expect – just hypothetically speaking, we shouldn't expect gross margin to go back to where it was last quarter, in the following quarters, is this sustainable what you're seeing now was gross margin?
John Gavin
Correct. I’d say that – as I said the variability is not going to be as wide as the Q1 to Q2 swing, but we will see variability in the gross margin rate. And as I said in my remarks, the target we still have for the long-term, we still believe that’s accurate 48% to 50% in terms of where we're going to be long-term
Tal Liani
Got it. Thank you.
John Gavin
Sure. No problem.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Savageaux
Hi, good afternoon and my congratulations as well on a great quarter. I wanted to ask – it looks like at least from a sequential standpoint while China remains strong for you and grew a bit on a year-over-year basis, real standout was growth in the U.S. and I want to focus in on that for a moment. I'm going to assume that the sort of focus of a lot of the cloud data center interconnect activity.
I wonder if you might be able to sort of frame your direct and indirect kind of engagement with the cloud players sort of is that getting to be material piece of your revenue. It looks like it is and sort of along with that I think you mentioned some new perhaps U.S. based OEMs moving into the top five.
I wonder if you can talk about whether – and this is going touching the gross margin issue as well, whether there is some sales of just coherent ASICs there, the whole modules are how that overall kind of cloud business looks both with the service providers and their traditional equipment suppliers? Thanks.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes, Tim. That's a good question. Again, I’ll take a crack at this and let John elaborate on this. But you're right in terms of just the growth itself I would not classify this as just one customer or two, but it’s – original eight customers they grew sequentially 117% as we said as opposed to the eight customers grew only 25% sequentially from Q1 to Q2. But we do see a lot of activity and there is a lot of growth that we saw coming from the data center, inter-data center networks and our products are deployed in several of these inter-data center networks.
But again, as we said before as a policy we’re not going to talk about individual customers other than the ones we list as the 10% customers in our 10-Q. So we are happy to see a couple of the Tier-1 customers move into and the growth is coming both from inter-data center as well as the metro networks.
Timothy Savageaux
Okay. Go ahead. I’m sorry.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
John do you have anything to add?
John Gavin
Yes. I'm just going to add to that from what Raj said a little bit in terms of the ship location. Keep in mind that ship location for us is going to be where our product is shipped to. So sometimes that cannot be where the end product ends up from our final customer perspective, so just wanted to keep that in mind. But Raj is correct.
I think the North America shift is definitely from the growth that we've discussed on our prepared remarks around not only the inter-data center market, but for the metro market as well. So metro as most people have seen is in a buildout cycle that’s globally and has picked up certainly from the North America perspective in terms of where some of those customers were seeing increases in demand in Q2. Also, a little bit of a long-haul exposure in North America specifically in the subsea aspect of the marketplace.

Timothy Savageaux
Okay, great. And any comments on the kind of ASIC versus module kind of business model or margin driver, is that sort of a material thing to discuss right now or is it principally DCO modules going into all your major customers?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. I think it's a latter term I think it's really the DCO driver is really what's predominant in our revenue structure versus components and that is driving it in terms of the revenue growth both in metro and inter-data center.
Timothy Savageaux
I can just throw one quick follow-up in their, I wondered if you can address from a competitive standpoint that does look like you're picking up some share here, but to what extent the strength and you mentioned 200 gigabits plus a lot of that's enabled by the advanced modulation technologies 16QAM and up among them. But if you could talk about kind of advanced modulation has a competitive factor in the marketplace and whether you see that as an advantage for Acacia?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes, Tim, so I'll take a crack at this and Benny will elaborate little bit, but if you look at the growth segments that we see which is the metro and DCI market. We have a unique combination of our low power high performance DSPs which are ideally suited for those market segments and integrated with our low cost silicon optics. And this combination in a module provides significant advantages to customers in those two market segments.
So that’s primarily the driver for us, growing share ourselves. There is competition that you would see in some individual segments, but as Benny pointed out as well, we are unique in being able to do the DCO as well as the ACO that gives us ability to move into taking share. Benny, do you have any other comments?
Benny Mikkelsen
I think you’ve mentioned clear answer.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Okay. Nothing more Tim on that.
Timothy Savageaux
Okay. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Thanks Tim.

Our next question is from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Paul Silverstein
Thanks guys. I just want to clarify something the guidance who gave is that similar to when you kicked off the IPO i.e. does not include any revenue from ZTE, are you now factoring in second half revenue from ZTE?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So Paul, the guidance we gave is Q3 only and within the Q3 number, we are assuming that ZTE is in that number for the third quarter.
Paul Silverstein
Okay. So you put the back in.
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Okay.
Paul Silverstein
Secondly, given the numbers you put up recognizes maybe – somewhat a silly question, but I’ll ask anyway. Where you are at all supply constraint?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. So it's a good question, Paul. As you know [indiscernible] last year and we put in place additional capacity to scale and so one of the reasons for our Q2 achievement was our ability to scale our CM as well to be able to meet the demand. Now we're not caught up on that demand at this point yet. We see some residual demand even in Q3 that is not going to be satisfied.
Because part of it is we are bringing in another CM, but we are also adding additional products like as you know the AC400 is ramping to high volumes and then of course we have the ACO products, so we are in a continual move where we are bringing in new CM, but also new products that makes it a little bit more challenging to meet all the demand we have, but we made significant headway in meeting the demand in Q2 and we expect in Q3 as well.
Paul Silverstein
Raj, correct me if I’m wrong, but you guys relying on third parties for lasers, correct? 
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes we do.
Paul Silverstein
Is that a source of meaningful constrain, is that an issue now were as you look forward. I know there are multiple suppliers, but is that an issue?

Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Well. So we have some great partners that we work with on supplying us with the ITLAs and however because as you rightly point out, there is a global demand and so we've got to continually be asking them to supply more which is always a little challenge. But we haven't seen any serious concerns because of that because you have some very good partners that we work with on this.
Paul Silverstein
All right. Two last quick questions related to customers. One, can you – John, I think I heard you correctly you said your top aid, you gave us the growth numbers, but can you give us the absolute dollars for the contribution between the eight and the other 25 or the other I guess that would be 17 - original and the non-original?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Oh, in Q2, yes we're not providing those kinds of breakdown metrics Paul.
Paul Silverstein
So you just given the growth not the dollars?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Correct.
Paul Silverstein
All right. And then on your 10% customers, collectively they were 78 down from 82 and there were three of them. Is that correct?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. That sounds right, yes.
Paul Silverstein
And I apologize, but did you tell us what they were in terms of you know how much from I know you're not naming them but can you tell us with respect to contributions were to get to the 78?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So in Q2 it was 32%, 27% in 10 for one, two, and three.
Paul Silverstein
And finally, John can you just I forget to ask the question, but going back to the you mentioned that you don't see gross margins going up meaningfully in the second half, if I heard you correctly and you like to identify one or two issues? Can you just repeat what those issues were the offsets given that I think I heard you and Raj say that with respect to each of the three drivers there was still a fair ways to go? What are offsets that will keep a lid on gross margin expansion in the near-term?
John Gavin
Yes, Paul. Sure, so in terms of gross margin I think one of the big drivers obviously that affects that is product mix and in that you know we're seeing the legacy products that don't use our silicon photonics devices come down at a bit of an accelerated pace. Those customers are moving their products into the silicon based products, so now we’re switching the mix of revenue a little bit harder - little bit faster to the PIC based solutions and that's one of the principle drivers.
The other aspect is we will be getting some continued cost improvement as we ramp up in the second half to our CMs in the lower cost regions. But the benefit - lot of the benefit of the mix portions has been accelerated a little bit. So we will have price changes coming through that that are normal for the business in the second half.
So you have those factors that kind of you know way in and out of gross margin calculation. So we’re a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of where we thought we would be at this point in time. And then until we get more vertical integration into some of the new products, we expect to be around this range.
Paul Silverstein
All right. I will pass it on. Thanks guys.
Operator
The next question is from the line of the Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas Clark
Great thanks a lot. First question on gross margins as well you've talked a number of times now about the mix of silicon based or vertically integrated silicon products, exiting 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016 I thought that mix was already quite high. So I'm just wondering if you can give us an estimate as to kind of how high or how much of a percentage of the mix that is at this point.
And then secondarily related to gross margins on the analog CFP2 product that's coming out, considering it doesn't have the ASIC DSP as well. Can you give us an early glimpse as to the impact to gross margins from that product?

Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes, Doug I will take look – take a crack at that. So exiting the 2015 part of the business. So legacy products were still shipping as a higher percentage of our overall revenue. In Q2 as an example it was under 10%. So that that mix shift is changing and a piece of that is the step function we took in revenue.
Those were obviously mostly all of the new PIC based products. So you know getting more gross margin dollar contribution from those products and then seeing the percentage of the legacy products you know come under the sub-10% range where it was in the – 20%, 25% range coming out end of the year.
John Gavin
And on the ACO product per se Doug I mean it doesn't have the DSP however it still uses our own silicon photonics PIC so which has most of the value in the ACO as well. So we're not giving exact margin numbers on each of those but that's still built on the same silicon technology.
Douglas Clark
Okay.
John Gavin
A lot of leverage out of that technology because its on our existing silicon photonics platforms.
Douglas Clark
Okay. That makes sense. And a follow-up on the ACO product as well. I know that you've been in sampling with customers for at least a quarter and a half competitively. What type of feedback are you getting on or reception are you getting on your product versus some of the other solutions that are starting to make their way into the market as well?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So as Benny had indicated, we are sampling with the few customers. There is strong interest from customers and again the interest on the ACO as we see is a little bit more regional where the Western Hemisphere we see more interest and the Eastern it's a lot more on DCO. But for the customers we are sampling, we are seeing very good interest and good feedback on performance as well on plan to ramp end of the year.
Douglas Clark
All right. Great. And then final question for me. You've mentioned a few times 100 gig and 400 gig, recognizing that 400 is more targeted right now to the DCI market. Can you give us a sense of kind of what the mix is between those two capacity speeds are at this point?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. We do have in our product, we have the multiple modulation format QPSK, 8QAM, 16QAM and it is per application and it depends on some of the – even in the data center they use the 8QAM modulation which is more like a long-haul link, but we're not breaking it down at this point, dug into capacity of 100G versus 400G, but the 400G is also in a high ramp mode and is in an over subscribe mode.
Douglas Clark
All right. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Alex Henderson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.
Alex Henderson
Hey. So I got a couple of questions for you. One, have you seen any changes in the DSP development programs out of any of your competitors. I’ve heard any – for instances made some progress on their DSP relative to the temperature issues. Have you seen any change in the landscape there and particularly within a couple of the OEMs that have their in-house, so if you’ve seen anything there that's allowing you to start to penetrate some of the in-house OEM opportunities?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
So Alex, we don’t – we are not going to go into exact details of customer and competition, but again as you know we've even on a pretty good clip in terms of DSP development and we've been in several cases first to market with our DSPs both for purpose built for metro versus purpose built for the long-haul and high performance. And what we can say is that we continue to – as John Gavin talked about, we are continuing to invest in R&D and maintain this clip of coming out with an ASIC almost every year and focused on particular segments. And so we plan to keep that kind of a leadership position, first to market position in DSPs as well.

And the other point to note is that as you know starting with 40-nanometer, now 28-nanometer going into 16-nanometer, going into 7-nanometer, these gets quite a bit more expensive, each iteration of technology and somebody who has a larger and larger market share it becomes easier to amortize these developments. And so we believe that this is on the right path for us to gain share with our DSPs.
Alex Henderson
So have you had any success in conversations with the in-house players that have their own DSP in-house? And particularly is there any residence starting to develop around the idea that we need to go to the commercial off-the-shelf chip mod approach to things as it has happened in every other industry, as well as moving to an open line system architecture which has happened in every other industry. Are you hearing any response back from the service providers or some of the in-house players that that's something they're cognizant of and they are starting to anticipate, I mean are they starting to think of you as maybe the Broadcom of the optical component market?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. That’s good point. Right I think from – we’ve heard many times there is a lot of requirement for interoperating between multiple platforms and we among the few others provide a platform for them to be able to interoperate with each other. But as I said before, we are engaged in discussions Alex with a few of those and we’ve had success with some, but again, they are not in a position to talk about them at this stage. And when they come to scale we’ll certainly be able to talk in these kind of forms.
Alex Henderson
Could I ask another question on the ACO side? What percentage of the ACO players that you're talking to are players that own their own DSP as opposed to players that are buying the ACO from you and buying your DSP in order to minimize the faceplate utilization on their system going to a smaller form factor so that they can mount your DSP and use your ACO. Can you talk about that mix a little bit?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. I’ll start and Benny can add to it, but as in a very new complex product integration, we focused on a few customers where it’s easier to integrate and get the product into a maturity level that that we can ramp. So our focus has been initially more with the costumers who had our own DSP. And I don't know Benny you have any other comments to add there.
Benny Mikkelsen
Yes. I think we see both type of customers, but we clearly see the majority of customers using our DSP, but we clearly have an advantage of integration between our ACO and DSP, but we are seeing both type of customers.
Alex Henderson
One last question I’ll [indiscernible] the floor, the year end price adjustments that happened in the first quarter given how tight and constrained the environment is, is that your sense that they're likely to come in at the very low end of the historical band?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
Yes. I think that's a very good point, Alex. I think historically as you seen in this industry 10% to 12% year-over-year, but of course for our constrained products we have a little bit more leverage to minimize the price drops, but there is going to be some level of year-over-year reduction which has been taken into account in our projections.
Alex Henderson
And how do the social net engineers workout for you?
Murugesan Shanmugaraj
As we said we're not going to – we're always looking for very strong people to come and work for us. And so – but we don't comment on specific projects that they're going to be working on.
Alex Henderson
Thanks guys.
End of Q&A
