San Antonio-based refining company Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO) has inked a historic transportation and storage deal in Mexico.
Tesoro Executive Vice President Keith Casey flew to Mexico City, where he signed a three-year deal with Pemex Logistics CEO Ignacio Aguilar Alvarez on Tuesday afternoon.

Under the terms of the deal, Tesoro will now be able to use refined product pipelines and storage terminals owned by Pemex Logistics in the states of Baja California and Sonora.




In May, Tesoro beat 21 other companies in a Pemex Logistics auction, in which the San Antonio-based company was reported to have offered the best tariffs to obtain capacity on the pipeline and storage terminal network.
Facing sagging production from six aging refineries, Mexico enacted historic energy reforms in late 2014, opening its market to foreign investment and competition. Touted as the first auction for Pemex Logistics, the reforms allow foreign companies such as Tesoro to sell gasoline, diesel and other refined products in Mexico.
Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said in a statement that the deal will boost the retail side of the refining company's business. The San Antonio-based refining company plans to sell gasoline and diesel in Mexico under its ARCO brand.
"The expansion of our strategic footprint to include Northern Mexico strengthens our integrated value chain with significant growth opportunities for our marketing business," Goff said in his statement. "We are excited about Mexico and the opportunity to create value for the company, customers, business partners and communities."




 


With refineries in El Paso and the Los Angeles area, the agreement with Pemex Logistics gives Tesoro capacity on pipelines linking cities such as Mexicali, Rosarito, Ensenada, Guayamas, Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregon. It also gives the refiner storage terminal space in Rosarito, Mexicali, Ensenada, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregón, Hermosillo, Magdalena, Nogales and Navojoa.
Pemex Logistics is expected to hold a second auction for capacity on its network this year.

San Antonio-based refining company Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO) has inked a historic transportation and storage deal in Mexico.
Tesoro Executive Vice President Keith Casey flew to Mexico City, where he signed a three-year deal with Pemex Logistics CEO Ignacio Aguilar Alvarez on Tuesday afternoon.

Under the terms of the deal, Tesoro will now be able to use refined product pipelines and storage terminals owned by Pemex Logistics in the states of Baja California and Sonora.




In May, Tesoro beat 21 other companies in a Pemex Logistics auction, in which the San Antonio-based company was reported to have offered the best tariffs to obtain capacity on the pipeline and storage terminal network.
Facing sagging production from six aging refineries, Mexico enacted historic energy reforms in late 2014, opening its market to foreign investment and competition. Touted as the first auction for Pemex Logistics, the reforms allow foreign companies such as Tesoro to sell gasoline, diesel and other refined products in Mexico.
Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said in a statement that the deal will boost the retail side of the refining company's business. The San Antonio-based refining company plans to sell gasoline and diesel in Mexico under its ARCO brand.
"The expansion of our strategic footprint to include Northern Mexico strengthens our integrated value chain with significant growth opportunities for our marketing business," Goff said in his statement. "We are excited about Mexico and the opportunity to create value for the company, customers, business partners and communities."




 


With refineries in El Paso and the Los Angeles area, the agreement with Pemex Logistics gives Tesoro capacity on pipelines linking cities such as Mexicali, Rosarito, Ensenada, Guayamas, Hermosillo and Ciudad Obregon. It also gives the refiner storage terminal space in Rosarito, Mexicali, Ensenada, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregón, Hermosillo, Magdalena, Nogales and Navojoa.
Pemex Logistics is expected to hold a second auction for capacity on its network this year.

Pemex seeks partners to boost Mexico refinery, logistics margins
By: Reuters | Jan 27 2016 at 06:45 PM 

MEXICO CITY - Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex is seeking private partners to improve margins at its refineries and logistical services, a top company executive said on Wednesday.

 Alejandro Martinez, head of the newly created Industrial Transformation division, which groups together much of the company’s activities beyond exploration and production of crude oil, said Pemex is evaluating the monetization of existing assets by selling them and then leasing them back.

 Pemex, like all oil companies, is grappling with a severe cash crunch due to a more than 70 percent decline in crude prices since 2014.

 Speaking at an energy forum, Martinez specifically pointed to projects covering waste water treatment, hydrogen supply, nitrogen separation and crude conditioning as areas in which the company will seek out new private partners.

 “In the past, (Pemex) would do all of these activities, but today there’s an opportunity for private Mexican or international companies to participate,” Martinez said.

 The executive also cited other logistical sale and lease-back areas such as Pemex’s oil and other multi-use pipelines as well as its processing terminals.

 He did not specify how soon companies would be able to bid on the partnerships or which projects would be first in line.

 “We have competitors practically at our doorstep,” Martinez said, referring to the implementation of a sweeping energy reform in Mexico finalized in 2014 that ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly on a wide range of oil sector activities.

 Martinez added that Pemex will only take a minority stake in its new co-generation power generation plants “as a sign to the market that we are opening up” and that the company has the next two years to cement the new partnerships.

 In 2018, Mexico’s retail fuel sector will be fully open to refined product imports from private or foreign companies and will no longer feature government-set prices.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

		  Mexico's PEMEX to Open Logistics System to Third Parties in February		  	



November 30, 2016 [OPIS] - Independent oil products distributors and retailers in Mexico will have access to Pemex's oil logistics systems, including pipelines and terminals, early next year.




Mexico's Comision Reguladora de Energia (CRE) has approved the proposal of procedure of open season to Pemex Logistica, as well as the terms and conditions for the service of storage and transportation by pipelines.
CRE said the open season, which allows third-party shippers to ship and store products on Pemex's logistics system, will increase efficiency in the Mexican oil industry and provide greater certainty to importers and marketers. The opening of Pemex's midstream system to third-party shippers is in line with the legal provisions established by Mexican energy reforms.
OPIS notes that Pemex pipelines and storage systems are currently closed to third parties. Pemex continues to have the monopoly of the Mexican oil products market despite an import liberalization earlier this year. The slow import flow by private companies so far this year is blamed on logistics constraints and fuel specifications issues. Mexico is one of the largest U.S. oil products export destinations in terms of volumes, and this north-south flow has increased in the past year due to nagging Mexican refinery issues.
While an opening for Pemex pipelines and terminals to third parties should increase private fuel imports in February, OPIS notes that CRE will continue to control the prices in the northern region of Mexico during the first four months of 2017. A price control may not offer much price discovery for third parties planning to import fuel into Mexico, but after April, fuel prices in northern Mexico will be allowed to float without CRE intervention.
The opening of Pemex systems will be implemented in two phases.
In the first phase, Pemex will make available about 267,000 b/d of pipeline capacity and around 959,000 bbl in storage capacity in northern Mexico. In accordance with the schedule of gasoline and diesel price flexibility to be established by CRE, the open seasons will be carried out by region.
The first will be in the northern zone of the country, and will include storage terminals and pipeline systems in the border states of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas.
OPIS notes that the first phase could allow independent importers in Mexico to buy fuel from rack terminals in California, Arizona and New Mexico for delivery on the Pemex system. The second phase would expand U.S. rack optionality for northern Mexico retailers and distributors to Texas, including Brownsville and El Paso.
The first phase of the Pemex Logistics open season will begin Feb. 1 and will end on April 30, with storage and pipeline infrastructure in Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas.
The first phase will cover storage terminals in Rosarito, Mexicali and Ensenada in Baja California. Terminals link to the Rosarito pipeline transportation system. The first phase will also cover terminals in Nogales, Magdalena, Hermosillo, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregon and Navojoa as well as terminals linked to the Guaymas pipeline transportation system.
CRE will launch an electronic platform to offer technical, operational and financial information and data on Pemex Logistica, and this is made available to interested third parties, CRE said.
CRE will also find a prequalification format for interested parties and an auction platform to receive the shipping and storage proposals.
In the current context of the free importation of petroleum products and the acceleration of the floating price mechanism or price liberalization for gasoline and diesel under market conditions, these procedures provide the basis for open and not unduly discriminatory access to the infrastructure of transport by pipeline and storage property of Pemex.
The second phase will kick off April 30. Third-party independent players will have access to terminals in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Parral, Gomez Palacio, Sabinas, Monclova, Saltillo, Nuevo Laredo, Santa Catarina, Cadereyta, Ciudad Mante, Reynosa, Ciudad Victoria and Madero.
The second phase will also cover terminals linked to the North Duct transport system.

Deals took the spotlight in Texas energy news last week, which featured a merger, a Mexican logistical agreement and the overturning of a jury decision on a broken deal from 2014. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan dropped some strong earnings numbers and Paragon came out of bankruptcy with a fresh board of directors. Here are five things to know in Texas energy this week:
• Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE: KMI) posted strong second-quarter earnings, saying it would increase its dividend by 60 percent for 2018 and 25 percent each year beyond that to 2020. It also managed to grow its backlog of projects to $12.2 billion, up $500 million from the first quarter. That growth can be funded through cashflow, without the need to seek additional debt, said Steve Kean, Kinder Morgan's CEO and president.

• Houston-based Rockwater Energy Solutions Inc. is planning an all-stock merger with Gainesville, Texas-based Select Energy Services Inc. (NYSE: WTTR). The combined company will operate under Select's name, and Select shareholders will own about 64.4 percent of the combined company. Holli Ladhani, currently the chairman, president and CEO of Rockwater, will be president and CEO of the combined company, while Select's top executive, John Schmitz, will be its executive chairman.




 


• San Antonio-based refining company Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO) has come to an agreement with Pemex Logistics to use refined product pipelines and storage terminals owned by the state oil company in Baja California and Sonora, both in Mexico. "The expansion of our strategic footprint to include Northern Mexico strengthens our integrated value chain with significant growth opportunities for our marketing business," Tesoro CEO Greg Goff said in a statement. "We are excited about Mexico and the opportunity to create value for the company, customers, business partners and communities."
• Paragon Offshore Ltd., which has its principal executive offices in Houston, has come out of bankruptcy and is searching for a new CEO. Dean Taylor was named interim president and CEO in November, and the company's creditors have appointed a new board of directors, led by James Swent as the company's chairman. Swent is a director of Energy XXI Gulf Coast Inc. and the retired executive vice president and CFO of Ensco PLC.

• An appeals court in Dallas has overturned a landmark 2014 decision by a jury in a dispute between Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE: EPD) and Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP (NYSE: ETP). The jury originally found that Enterprise had wrongfully dropped Energy Transfer from a deal to build a pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast, but a three-judge panel overturned that decision.
