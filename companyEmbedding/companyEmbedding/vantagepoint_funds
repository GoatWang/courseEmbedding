These asset allocations are referred to as “neutral targets” because they do not reflect decisions that may be made by ICMA-RC, the investment adviser to the underlying fund, to overweight or underweight a particular asset class based on market or operational factors. The neutral targets also do not reflect performance differences between the Fund’s asset class allocations that will cause temporary deviations from the neutral targets. The actual asset class allocation of the Fund may vary by as much as five percentage points as a result of ICMA-RC’s allocation decisions, performance differences between asset classes of the Fund, or some combination thereof.Fixed Income FundsFundVT III Vantagepoint Low Duration Bond FundVT III Vantagepoint Core Bond Index FundVT III Vantagepoint Inflation Focused FundVT III Vantagepoint High Yield FundEquity FundsFundVT III Vantagepoint Equity Income FundVT III Vantagepoint Growth & Income FundVT III Vantagepoint Growth FundVT III Vantagepoint Select Value FundVT III Vantagepoint Mid/Small Company Index FundVT III Vantagepoint Aggressive Opportunities FundVT III Vantagepoint Discovery FundVT III Vantagepoint International FundVT III Vantagepoint Emerging Markets FundThird Party Emerging Markets ETFMulti-Strategy FundFundVT III Vantagepoint Diversifying Strategies Fund
         
      Target Date Funds: The VT Vantagepoint Milestone Funds are target date funds. Each invests substantially all of its assets in a single VT III Vantagepoint Milestone Fund (“Milestone Fund”) that shares its name and investment objective. In turn, each underlying Milestone Fund is a “fund of funds” that invests substantially all of its assets in other VT III Vantagepoint Funds and one or more third party ETFs. By investing in this way, each Milestone Fund is exposed to the risks as well as the potential rewards of its underlying funds and of the portfolio holdings and strategies of those funds. The targeted allocation of each underlying Milestone Fund’s assets among underlying funds and the asset classes they represent is determined by ICMA-RC, the investment adviser to the VT III Vantagepoint Funds. Over time, ICMA-RC will adjust the asset allocation of each “dated” Milestone Fund to seek to become more conservative as the year designated in its name approaches and for approximately 10 years beyond the designated year. This is intended to reduce investment risk as investors move toward and into retirement. However, there is no guarantee that this goal will be achieved and investors may lose money investing in the Milestone Funds. Ten years after the date in the Milestone Fund’s name, it will reach its “landing point” and its target asset allocation becomes constant. It is expected that when a Milestone Fund reaches its “landing point” it will merge with the Milestone Retirement Income Fund.The asset allocation changes that occur over time as depicted in the Glide Path below are referred to as “neutral targets” because they do not reflect decisions that may be made by ICMA-RC to overweight or underweight a particular asset class based on market or operational factors. The neutral targets also do not reflect performance differences between the Fund’s asset allocations that will cause temporary deviations from the neutral targets. The actual asset class allocation of the Fund may vary from the neutral target by as much as five percentage points as a result of ICMA-RC’s allocation decisions, performance differences between asset classes of the Fund, or some combination thereof.Principal Investment Risks

                66The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

VantagePoint

				Our flagship product, VantagePoint, is a powerful text-mining tool for discovering knowledge in search results from patent and literature databases. VantagePoint helps you rapidly understand and navigate through large search results, giving you a better perspective—a better vantage point—on your information. The perspective provided by VantagePoint enables you to quickly find WHO, WHAT, WHEN and WHERE, enabling you to clarify relationships and find critical patterns—turning your information into knowledge.	



VantagePoint works with search results from text databases. First conduct a search using a search engine provided by your database provider. Then download the raw data to your computer, and import it into VantagePoint using an Import Filter.
VantagePoint is most useful when your search strategy returns "more than you want to read." It can provide great benefit when working with only a few dozen records, but it is most helpful when you need to work with thousands of records.
VantagePoint’s capabilities can be broadly classified into five categories:

Importing – getting the raw data into VantagePoint and mining the raw data to get more data from it.
Cleaning – transforming the data into a consistent set, combining the things that you want to analyze as a group, and merging and normalizing data from diverse sources.
Analyzing – looking at your data in a variety of ways
Reporting – preparing to communicate your results
Automating – encoding the entire process to make it consistently and easily repeatable

The menu at the top-right of this page lists just a few of VantagePoint’s major features. Browse these pages to get an overview of how VantagePoint can help you get good answers quickly. 
 


Extracting and Indexing Data:  After a search, the user imports the data into VantagePoint—a one-time event for each dataset. Fields are mined from the text using pattern matching, rule-based, and natural language processing techniques to obtain:

Fields found in most bibliographic databases (for example, authors, inventors, affiliations, assignees, dates, descriptors, index terms, and classification codes),
Normalized values that are sometimes buried in the basic fielded data or presented in mixed formats, such as dates, classification codes, or patent numbers,
Meaningful words and phrases from the titles, abstracts, patent claims, and other free text, and
Entities defined in user-managed dictionaries.


For this import process, VantagePoint uses Import Filters, which can be specifically tailored for each database, database provider, and your particular requirements. Our Import Engine is a powerful tool for leveraging the value that is hidden in your data.
There are three ways to handle your Import Filters:

Our on-line library contains more than 180 Import Filters covering a large proportion of the patent, business, science, and technology databases; and it is freely available to our customers.
Our support team can create and customize Import Filters to your requirements.
VantagePoint comes with all of the tools you need to do-it-yourself.


Top 10 Lists:  You can browse your data from many perspectives. The simplest tool is a list. Using a list of affiliations (or authors or countries), you can see the top affiliations (or authors or countries) and browse the records for each one. You can sort and search your lists in an instant, and create groups in your lists in many different ways.
List Comparison lets you compare any two lists from any set of VantagePoint data and identify the common or unique items in the lists. With time-sliced data sets, this can help you identify new or emerging concepts, authors, institutions, or countries.
Using Group using Thesaurus, you can apply a thesaurus to your list and create groups of list items.
Find and Group searches the list for your target text and adds matching items to a group. Find provides for three search strings and several Boolean operators (for example, "and," "adjacent," "near4," "or", etc.).
… and no, you are not limited to viewing 10 at a time.


Co-occurrence Matrices:  Using a Co-occurrence matrix, you can spread a list across any other list. For example, using a co-occurrence matrix of "author" and "year of publication," you can see an author's publication trend over time and browse their publications by year. This way, you can see which authors have been working in an area for the longest time as well as whether they are still active.

 




Data from lists and co-occurrence matrices can be easily exported to other applications for visualization or customized analysis. This example shows a three-dimensional column chart created using VantagePoint data in Microsoft Excel—simply select a portion of the co-occurrence matrix, copy it to the Clipboard, and paste into Excel.



This example is created from a co-occurrence matrix of publication source-by-year. It shows the relative publication trends in the different research communities. The "research communities" are created in a list—Group using Thesaurus—and the co-occurrence matrix is created using the groups. These data are also exported directly from VantagePoint and plotted in Microsoft Excel.





Maps/Networks:  Beyond one-dimensional (Lists) and two-dimensional (Co-occurrence matrices) analyses, VantagePoint performs multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among concepts, people, organizations, and countries.



This example shows an Auto-Correlation Map. Each node represents one person (in this example, inventors associated with a particular organization in a patent dataset). Proximity of people and links between people show the strength of relationship (correlation) based on co-occurrence of their names in the same records (e.g., patents). Some "teams" can be readily seen and one individual that is related to everyone else.




This example shows a factor map of Descriptors (index terms) in a dataset. Each node may represent several descriptors that are combined based on how frequently they occur together. Proximity and links show higher correlation among terms. From the map the user can browse the underlying text for each node.






Data Cleaning:  VantagePoint uses fuzzy matching techniques to identify, associate, and clean up data. For example, it will handle misspellings, alternative hyphenation and capitalization, and differing conventions for listing the names of people and companies, providing you with higher-quality data that is essential for good analysis. The data cleaning tools can be applied to any field, and VantagePoint can automatically "check" the fuzzy matches by looking at a complementary field—for example when matching inventor names, also requiring the assignee to match.
After VantagePoint's automatic cleanup, the Cleanup Confirm window gives you a powerful toolset and full control of the results. The Detail Windows let you interactively validate the cleanup suggestions.


User Managed Thesauri:  With VantagePoint you can create, edit, and apply thesauri, which can be used for specialized data reduction or conversion. Using a thesaurus, you can easily combine all variants of a data element (for example, United States, US, U.S., USA, etc.). For other types of analysis, you can combine data elements into broad categories (for example, "aluminum alloys," "magnesium alloys," "carbon fiber reinforced plastics," and "copper alloys" into "Materials"; or "USA," "Canada," and "Mexico" into "North America"). You can also use a thesaurus to transform classification codes or index terms into something more easily understood.

VantagePoint's Thesaurus Editor provides several interactive tools for creating, editing, testing, and managing your thesauri. VantagePoint's thesauri support both normal text and Regular Expressions for matching data in the source list.


Scripting: You can automate sequences of actions using VantagePoint's extensions to Microsoft's VBScript. Create and distribute scripts and make your customized analysis techniques and processes easily repeatable.

 
VantagePoint adds eight VB objects and over 200 VB methods to VBScript.
 


Operating Systems - VantagePoint works on Windows 7, 8, and 10 platforms. VantagePoint has a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version.  The 64-bit version of VantagePoint requires the 64-bit version of Windows.
Installation on Windows Server is not supported. Other operating systems (e.g., Macintosh OS X or Linux) are not supported.

While not a requirement for running VantagePoint, some of our Visual Basic scripts require Microsoft Excel (2003 or later).

Processor - Intel i3 or better, or similar non-mobile processors.  The faster the processor, the better the performance.  VantagePoint will use multi-core processors to improve performance of many operations. 
Memory - The minimum recommended operating RAM is 4 GB.  With 64-bit VantagePoint, a minimum of 8 GB is recommended.  
The available physical RAM has the biggest impact on VantagePoint performance.  VantagePoint files can be quite large and it is much easier to work with them if they can be loaded into RAM.  If the operating system has to use Virtual Memory to load a file into VantagePoint, performance will be slower.
On a 32-bit Windows Operating System, the 32-bit version of VantagePoint can use up to 2GB of RAM.  On a 64-bit Windows Operating System, 32-bit VantagePoint can use up to 4GB of RAM.
The 64-bit version of VantagePoint can use much more RAM.  The exact amount depends on the specific version of the Operating System.  For most professional versions of Windows, 64-bit VantagePoint can use at least 128GB of RAM.  Some versions of Windows allow much more.
Disk Space - VantagePoint itself uses about 700MB of disk space. This does not include the disk space needed for your data files, which can be quite large - typically no less than 5MB/1000 records.
Since VantagePoint files can be quite large, a fast hard drive reduces the time required to load the file from storage to RAM. Standard drive sizes are usually more than sufficient for VantagePoint file storage. If you are planning to work with large files on a regular basis, it is helpful to have two separate hard drives - one for the operating system and one for storage. We have found that the Windows operating system tends to severely fragment large files over time which slows down performance. If the operating system is on the first drive and data is stored on the second drive, then the files are less fragmented. (In theory, partitioning a drive should work but we have found that a second drive performs better than a single drive with two partitions.)
Display - Graphical and tabular outputs of VantagePoint require a minimum of 1024 x 768 screen resolution.
Data - In addition, VantagePoint requires that you have access to sources of bibliographic data and database definition files for these data sources. Database definition files are available for many popular databases and custom definition files can be coded for virtually any structured text database.

Licensing: VantagePoint is licensed on a per-seat basis. The standard commercial single seat VantagePoint license is perpetual and requires no annual fees after the initial purchase.
Included with each license:

12 months of downloadable upgrades. The upgrades are available through the VantagePoint web site.
12 months of user support, including

Assistance configuring VantagePoint for use with your databases
Guidance in applying the product in your business context
Access to our expanding on-line library of import filters (>100) and dozens of macros, thesauri, and fuzzy filters that you can tailor to your specific application


12 months of technical support.
VantagePoint Reader - enables colleagues to view datasets and sheets that have been created in VantagePoint (for example lists, maps, matrices, profiles, and charts). VP Reader is freely distributable within your organization.

After the first 12 months you may purchase annual Subscriptions to continue receiving upgrades and support.>
Pricing:  If you would like information on pricing, volume discounts, or academic licensing, please contact us.

† The benchmark shown is a "best fit" benchmark assigned by Morningstar. Morningstar does not calculate benchmark performance for funds with a blended, or combined primary benchmark. For more information on the Fund's benchmark, please click on the prospectus link above. 
Powered by Morningstar.
Morningstar data is shown as of the most recent reporting period by each fund family. Allocations may not equal 100% and will vary overtime. Assets contained within "Other" category are not classified by Morningstar. All information presented in this tool is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be investment advice. The information is not meant to be an offer to sell or a recommendation to buy any investment product. Unless otherwise noted, performance is shown before sales charge. For more fund information, click the prospectuses button.
All information is historical and not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your shares. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. After-sales-charge returns reflect the maximum sales charge applicable to the fund, which can be found within the Table Chart. Performance may not reflect any expense limitation or subsidies currently in effect. Short-term trading fees may apply. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit Morningstar.com.
This material is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a recommendation of any specific investment product, strategy, or decision, and is not intended to suggest taking or refraining from any course of action. It is not intended to address the needs, circumstances, and objectives of any specific investor. Putnam, which earns fees when clients select its products and services, is not offering impartial advice in a fiduciary capacity in providing this sales and marketing material. This information is not meant as tax or legal advice.

‡ As of May 8, 2017, Putnam High Yield Advantage Fund was renamed to Putnam High Yield Fund.


Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 



Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund and Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, which is 3% in the first year, declining to 1% in the fourth year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the periods, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower. 



Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.



For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3–, 5–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Rankings for other periods can be found on the Facts & Rankings tab.

Compare correlation to uncover hidden portfolio risk
Diversifying by market cap, geography, or investment style may not be enough.
The traditional model for building a diversified portfolio may not be adequate in today's market. Adding small-cap stocks to a large-cap portfolio, combining growth stocks with value stocks, or even supplementing a U.S.-focused fund mix with international or emerging-market equities may not create the level of diversification desired. The reason: high correlations across markets and investment styles over the past several years.
