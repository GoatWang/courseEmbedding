Del Alamo gives back to ACIS:
$1.5 million pledge for professorship



For most teens, college is the first time they learn what it’s like to live apart from their parents. For Jorge Del Alamo Jr. (ACCT ’69), the lesson came earlier.
In 1961, Del Alamo’s family sent the 14-year-old, his sister, and their cousin away from Fidel Castro’s Cuba to the United States. The children lived in orphanages for six months until their parents could join them.
Jorge and Lin Del Alamo
“That was an eye-opening experience, going from a place where people were really looking after you to where if, say, you didn’t like the food and want to eat, that’s just your problem,” Del Alamo recalled. “But, looking back, it makes you a better person.”
His family eventually settled in Danville, Va., where his father — an attorney in Cuba — found work teaching Spanish. After high school, Del Alamo took his first accounting class at a Virginia Tech satellite program in his hometown.
“It was like somebody turned on the light,” recalled Del Alamo, who transferred to Blacksburg as a junior. “I knew I wanted to be an accountant. … It’s a very logical field of study. Things are supposed to balance. That squares with my personality, which is pretty orderly.”
Del Alamo’s skill at accounting and fluency in Spanish helped him excel at KPMG, where he was a partner for 23 years and did tax work for international firms. He lives in Corpus Christi, Texas, but makes sure to stop by Blacksburg on regular visits to his parents, who now live in Charlottesville.
Del Alamo credits Virginia Tech with preparing him to succeed, and he is a major supporter of the Department of Accounting and Information Systems. He has given to the KPMG professorship held by Larry Killough and has endowed an accounting scholarship. He and his wife Lin have created an excellence fund to benefit the department and recently pledged $1.5 million in future support for a professorship in accounting.
“You look back and realize you don’t do all this on your own,” Del Alamo said. “You owe this to a lot of other people, [like] your parents, but also [to] the university, for the great education and opportunity to gain confidence and mature and learn the value of hard work.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.
