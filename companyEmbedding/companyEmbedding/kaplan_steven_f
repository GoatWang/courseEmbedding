WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.

With more than twenty nine years in this practice, Dr. Kaplan has become one of the leading podiatrists in the area.  Patients of all ages come from near and far to be treated by him.  He is a dedicated professional who has a deep compassion for all his patients and works diligently to help each of them achieve optimum results.  From surgeries to simple injections, fractures to sprains, plantar faciitis and foot deformities to routine nail care we are here to help.  Dr. Kaplan's business has grown so much that we have expanded out team. We are very excited that Dr. Jennifer Chen is now apart of our work family.  Dr. Chen has a history working with Dr. Kaplan serving as a resident in our office and assisting him in surgeries.  She herself has built quite the following in our practice.  Having Dr. Chen here full time is making a world of difference with wait times for appointments. Gone are the days when patients had to wait a month to get in. We in Doctor Kaplan's office are committed and focused on providing our patients with the highest levels of care and will do everything we can to meet your podiatric needs, and expectations. We are certain that you will be happy that you chose our office and we look forward to taking care of you and your feet. 













Why us?








Our doctors spend quality time with each of our patients in order to give quality care.  It is their goal that you leave our office with the knowledge you need to help make your feet feel the best they can.

WAYS TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY
We offer five ways to lower the cost of tuition and get you to graduation sooner. 


Transfer Credits
Scholarships
Eligible Work, Life, and Military Experience
Testing Out of Courses
Tuition Cap Programs







Maximize the credits you've already earned.
If you’re on a bachelor’s track, you may be able to transfer your entire associate’s degree from qualifying institutions into eligible programs. You could be halfway finished on your first day of class. 

Apply for our Every Credit Counts Scholarship.
If you have at least one prior college credit, you could save $500 per term on your bachelor’s or associate's degree. 

Earn credits for your real-world experience.
Turn your life experiences into college credits with our portfolio development course—and finish your undergraduate degree faster. Kaplan University also recognizes military training as potential college credit. 

Test out of courses in subjects you’ve already mastered.
Don’t repeat what you already know. Demonstrate proficiency through one of our many course assessments to earn college credit. 

Explore our Tuition Cap programs.
For some Kaplan University degrees, we limit your tuition so you never pay more than a set maximum for your education. Once you reach your tuition cap, you no longer have to make payments. You could save up to 33% off full tuition.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
