Cullen number - Wikipedia





















 






Cullen number

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In mathematics, a Cullen number is a natural number of the form 



n
⋅

2

n


+
1


{\displaystyle n\cdot 2^{n}+1}

 (written 




C

n




{\displaystyle C_{n}}

). Cullen numbers were first studied by Fr. James Cullen in 1905. Cullen numbers are special cases of Proth numbers.
Properties[edit]
In 1976 Christopher Hooley showed that the natural density of positive integers 



n
≤
x


{\displaystyle n\leq x}

 for which Cn is a prime is of the order o(x) for 



x
→
∞


{\displaystyle x\to \infty }

. In that sense, almost all Cullen numbers are composite.[1] Hooley's proof was reworked by Hiromi Suyama to show that it works for any sequence of numbers n · 2n+a + b where a and b are integers, and in particular also for Woodall numbers. The only known Cullen primes are those for n equal:

1, 141, 4713, 5795, 6611, 18496, 32292, 32469, 59656, 90825, 262419, 361275, 481899, 1354828, 6328548, 6679881 (sequence A005849 in the OEIS).

Still, it is conjectured that there are infinitely many Cullen primes.
As of February 2016[update], the largest known Cullen prime is 6679881 × 26679881 + 1. It is a megaprime with 2,010,852 digits and was discovered by a PrimeGrid participant from Japan.[2]
A Cullen number Cn is divisible by p = 2n − 1 if p is a prime number of the form 8k - 3; furthermore, it follows from Fermat's little theorem that if p is an odd prime, then p divides Cm(k) for each m(k) = (2k − k)   (p − 1) − k (for k > 0). It has also been shown that the prime number p divides C(p + 1) / 2 when the Jacobi symbol (2 | p) is −1, and that p divides C(3p − 1) / 2 when the Jacobi symbol (2 | p) is +1.
It is unknown whether there exists a prime number p such that Cp is also prime.
Generalizations[edit]
Sometimes, a generalized Cullen number base b is defined to be a number of the form n × bn + 1, where n + 2 > b; if a prime can be written in this form, it is then called a generalized Cullen prime. Woodall numbers are sometimes called Cullen numbers of the second kind.[3]
According to Fermat's little theorem, if there is a prime p such that n is divisible by p - 1 and n + 1 is divisible by p (especially, when n = p - 1) and p does not divide b, then bn must be congruent to 1 mod p (since bn is a power of bp - 1 and bp - 1 is congruent to 1 mod p). Thus, n × bn + 1 is divisible by p, so it is not prime. For example, if some n congruent to 2 mod 6 (i.e. 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ...), n × bn + 1 is prime, then b must be divisible by 3 (except b = 1).
Least n such that n × bn + 1 is prime are (with question marks if this term is currently unknown)[4][5]

What New Jersey Clients Have to Say



Eric has consistently provided me with great custom clothes. The very few times that an issue or problem has arisen, he has addressed the issue immediately without incident.'Harrison GreeneButler Melfa and Taylor P.A.Clothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzEric, thanks for all the great clothes.
It is important to look like a VIP, it makes you feel like a VIP.
In today's world, let's face it, people judge you, largely, on your appearance, and great clothes are a huge part of making the good impression that is necessary to positively connect with other fine people. Tom James clothing provides a place for me in elite company.'Neil WeisbrodClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzI didn't properly thank you on Tuesday.  You really went above and beyond on the order and I truly appreciate!  First class.'Jim RozakisSr. VP Cintas CorpClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzEric quickly became attuned to my preferred styles, but also has broadened my wardrobe options and palettes with well-thought and on-fashion recommendations. The frequent, positive feedback that I receive from family, friends, and colleagues underscores his value to me.'Rob JacapraroPrincipal, Small Institutional Asset Management FirmClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzI did not know Eric prior to spending time with him discussing my clothing needs. Since then, we have become personal friends, because I know he cares more about me than just what I can buy from him. He has called me out of the blue to provide business contacts and leads for me, and has helped me grow my business - because he believes in the services and team we provide.'Brian DavisManaging Director and CEO Clearview ConsultingClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzEric, it was a great weekend.  I certainly wasn't the best looking guy there, but I was the best dressed!  Thx.'Toby BaileyAT&TClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzAbout to take off on a flight to Mexico for a few days, but wanted to send you a quick email thanking you for everything. I felt and looked great, the tux was perfect, and I got a ton of compliments on the tux (and especially the lining!). The tuxes for the dads also were perfect, both were very happy and got tons of compliments as well. .'Scott HollanderClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzI just wanted to drop a line to thank Tom James and in particular its representative, Eric Hymowitz.  Eric was courteous, friendly, prompt, and professional.  The suits and shirts are the nicest clothing items I've ever owned and I feel like a million bucks when I wear them.  The purchase was a gift to myself for losing 45 pounds.  There has been no better reward than the compliments I received at a wedding my wife and I recently attended.   The Tom James experience was nothing short of sensational and I will recommend your services to anyone that will listen.' AschenbrandRegional Sales ManagerClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzI like to note that I am very happy with your work and extremely satisfied with your tailoring on my suit that was just made as well as your service.  It is  perfect.   Thanks again and keep up the good work.'V. Anthony TangoSenior Financial Advisor                                                   Senior Portfolio Manager                                               PIAClothier: Eric HymowitzEric HymowitzI have been working with Eric Hymowitz for the last 6 months or so. Since then, Eric has helped me completely revamp my entire wardrobe. Words cannot describe how much better I feel wearing clothes that actually fit my body type! Recently, Eric recommended the new wrinkle-free shirt, which I am ecstatic about. It is comfortable and looks amazing. 
I would highly recommend Eric and his services. He is a punctual, knowledgable, and customer orientated sales professional.'Raed JarrarUniform Rental DivisionClothier: Eric HymowitzEric Hymowitz
