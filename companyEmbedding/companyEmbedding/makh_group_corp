The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Gulmira Makhmutova, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Ms. Makhmutova’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non-binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms.
Makhmutova will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Ms. Makhmutova. Ms. Makhmutova will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the
full $60,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any
proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Gulmira Makhmutova, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Ms. Makhmutova’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non-binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms.
Makhmutova will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Ms. Makhmutova. Ms. Makhmutova will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Currently, the market of consulting services in China is quite actively
developed. Presently, there are many companies that render similar services. Due
to its economic growth, China, as of today, becomes a more attractive platform
for business. In order to take up a more beneficial position on this market, we
offer to organize a complex service approach, that is, to offer a service
package from which the client could choose the best one. Moreover, we see an
advantage in working remotely  with the client, and for that purpose, we plan to
maximize our online tools.

   counsels and auditors.                                                       

5) Development of logistic schemes of product delivery from China

6) Market analysis and marketing research in China

7) Arrangement of business tours and excursions of product plants in China      
   (including virtual ones) and exhibitions.                                    

8) Assistance with organization of contacts and business meetings between 
   clients and Chinese commercial and industrial companies, plants and 
   factories.

MAKH GROUP
CORP.

CONDENSED
NOTES TO THE

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

FOR THE
THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015

(UNAUDITED)

 

NOTE 1 -
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Organization
and Description of Business

 

MAKH GROUP
CORP. (the “Company”, “we” or
“us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Nevada on August 13, 2014 (“Inception”) and has adopted
a December 31 fiscal year end. The Company intends to provide
business-consulting services in China.

 

NOTE 2
– GOING CONCERN

 

The
Company has incurred a loss since Inception (August 13, 2014)
resulting in an accumulated deficit of $32,409 as of September 30,
2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its
business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 Management believes that the Company’s capital
requirements will depend on many factors including the success of
the Company’s development efforts and its efforts to raise
capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise
additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no
assurance that such financing will be available in the future.
  The conditions described above raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the
amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or,
obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
and, or, the  private placement of common stock.
 

 

NOTE 3 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Interim
Financial Statements

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements and
related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to Form 10-Q and
Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements
furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for
the full year. These unaudited interim financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto
contained in the Company’s Form S-1 (amendment #1) filed on
March 16, 2016.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The
Company’s year -end is December 31.

Recent
accounting pronouncements

The
Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to
determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is
determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the
Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study
to determine the consequence of the change to its financial
statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to
ascertain that the Company’s financials properly reflect the
change. The Company currently does not have any recent accounting
pronouncements that they are studying and feel may be
applicable.

 

 

Earnings
Per Share

For the
nine months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no
potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or
outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the
computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the
Company incurred losses in these years.

 

 

NOTE 4
– INCOME TAXES

 

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for
differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to

was $1,525 and $9,425 respectively. The loan is non-interest
bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.

term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through,
among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

expenses incurred generally related to corporate overhead, financial and
administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting, developmental

Our net loss for the three months period ended March 31, 2017 was $9,636
compared to $4,155 during the three months period ended March 31, 2016 due to
the factors discussed above.
Three Months Period Ended March 31, 2017 compared to Three Month Period Ended

                                                                        9 | Page



2) Arrangement of business tours of product plants in China.
3) Development of logistic schemes of product delivery from China
4) Market analysis and marketing research in China
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As at March 31, 2017 our current assets were $4,168 compared to $6,874 in
current assets at December 31, 2016.  The decrease in cash was due to an
increase Company expenses and the increase in prepaid expenses for a prepayment
of an annual fee. As at March 31, 2017, our current liabilities were $20,450
compared to $ 13,520 as of December 31, 2016.
Stockholder's equity was $6,646 as of December 31, 2016 compared to
stockholder's deficit of $16,282 as of March 31, 2017.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the
three month period ended March 31, 2017, net cash flows used in operating
activities was $3,457, consisting of net loss of  $9,636,prepaid expenses of
$2,499 and a $3,680 increase in accrued expenses.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We neither used, nor provided cash flows from investing activities during the
three month period ended March 31, 2017.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows provided by financing activities during the three month period ended
March 31, 2017 were $3,250, consisting of loans from our director.
                         PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a
combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our
working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of
our business.
Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated
cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next
twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements.
Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the
private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our
business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses
and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii)
developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing
expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of
securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise
additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating
requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will
result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might
have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional
financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate
funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be
able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in financial



                                                                       10 | Page



condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
GOING CONCERN
The independent auditors' report accompanying our December 31, 2016 financial
statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been
prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates
that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in
the ordinary course of business.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
