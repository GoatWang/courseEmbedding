      KLX Inc.

WELLINGTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--B/E Aerospace, Inc. (Nasdaq: BEAV), the world’s leading manufacturer of 
      aircraft cabin interior products and the world’s leading provider of 
      aerospace fasteners, consumables and logistics services, announced today 
      the appointments of Joseph T. Lower as Vice President and Chief 
      Financial Officer of B/E Aerospace, Inc. and Michael F. Senft as Vice 
      President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of KLX Inc. Mr. Lower 
      will initially join B/E Aerospace as Vice President, Finance and be 
      appointed Vice President and Chief Financial Officer upon the 
      effectiveness of the separation of KLX Inc. from B/E Aerospace, Inc.
    


      Mr. Lower most recently was Vice President of Business Development and 
      Strategy for The Boeing Company, where he spent the last twelve years. 
      In this role, Mr. Lower was responsible for the corporate strategy, 
      mergers and acquisitions, and transaction integration departments within 
      Boeing. He worked closely with Boeing’s senior executive team and 
      Boeing’s business units to assess, define and enable differentiated 
      growth strategies. He was also a member of the International and Finance 
      leadership teams. Prior to joining Boeing in 2002, among other finance 
      positions, Mr. Lower spent 6 years with Credit Suisse in various 
      investment banking roles including positions in Mergers and 
      Acquisitions, and Corporate Finance. Transactions completed included 
      mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, public equity offerings, and high 
      yield debt financings. Mr. Lower received his M.B.A. from the J.L. 
      Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University and his 
      B.A. in Finance from the Indiana University School of Business. Mr. 
      Lower will be joining B/E Aerospace on November 1, 2014.
    

      Amin J. Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of B/E Aerospace, 
      commented, “I am pleased to welcome Joe as a member of our executive 
      team who will be working directly with Werner Lieberherr and me. Joe’s 
      strong financial background and deep knowledge of the aerospace 
      industry, having been with Boeing over the past 12 years, will serve Joe 
      well in his new role at B/E Aerospace.”
    

      Mr. Khoury, continued, “I am also pleased to welcome Mike Senft to KLX 
      in his new role as CFO and Treasurer.”
    

      Mr. Senft most recently was a Managing Director of Moelis & Company, 
      where he provided strategic advisory services to clients in a variety of 
      industries, including the Industrials, Metals and Mining, and Food 
      sectors. He has been a member of the B/E Aerospace, Inc. Board of 
      Directors since February 2012, a position he will cease to serve on the 
      effective date of the separation of KLX Inc. from B/E Aerospace, Inc. 
      For more than twenty years, Mr. Senft has been a highly valued adviser 
      to B/E Aerospace, having structured and placed or advised the Company on 
      long-term capital transactions totaling over $4 billion and advised the 
      Company on essentially all strategic acquisitions. Mr. Senft has over 30 
      years of experience as an investment banker, including prior roles as 
      Global Head of Leveraged Finance at CIBC, and Global Co-Head of 
      Leveraged Finance at Merrill Lynch. Mr. Senft has served on the Board of 
      Directors of Moly Mines Ltd., a development stage mining company 
      publicly listed on the Australian and Toronto stock exchanges and he 
      served on the Board of Directors of Del Monte Foods. Mr. Senft holds a 
      B.A. in Economics from Princeton University and an M.B.A. from the Stern 
      School of Business at New York University. Mr. Senft will be joining KLX 
      today, October 6, 2014.
    

      Mr. Khoury concluded, “I look forward to working closely with Joe and 
      Werner Lieberherr at B/E Aerospace and with Mike and Tom McCaffrey at 
      KLX.”
