Description
An in-depth look into the various aspects of behavioral
finance
Behavioral finance applies systematic analysis to ideas that
have long floated around the world of trading and investing. Yet it
is important to realize that we are still at a very early stage of
research into this discipline and have much to learn. That is why
Edwin Burton has written Behavioral Finance: Understanding the
Social, Cognitive, and Economic Debates.
Engaging and informative, this timely guide contains valuable
insights into various issues surrounding behavioral finance. Topics
addressed include noise trader theory and models, research into
psychological behavior pioneered by Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky, and serial correlation patterns in stock price data. Along
the way, Burton shares his own views on behavioral finance in order
to shed some much-needed light on the subject.

Discusses the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and its
history, and presents the background of the emergence of behavioral
finance
Examines Shleifer's model of noise trading and explores other
literature on the topic of noise trading
Covers issues associated with anomalies and details serial
correlation from the perspective of experts such as DeBondt and
Thaler
A companion Website contains supplementary material that allows
you to learn in a hands-on fashion long after closing the book

In order to achieve better investment results, we must first
overcome our behavioral finance biases. This book will put you in a
better position to do so.

Behavioral finance applies systematic analysis to ideas that have long existed in the world of trading and investing. However, it is important to realize that we are still at a very early stage of research into this discipline and have much to learn. In Behavioral Finance: Understanding the Social, Cognitive, and Economic Debates,Edwin Burton and Sunit Shah put behavioral finance under the microscope to help you gain a better understanding of the various aspects of this subset of behavioral economics.
Engaging and informative, this timely guide contains valuable insights into various issues surrounding behavioral finance. Burton and Shah examine the psychological research pioneered by Kahneman and Tversky—including anomalies such as consumer choice with certainity and uncertainity, perception biases, and reading into randomness—that underlies behavior in financial markets. They discuss the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), summarize its history, and present the background of the emergence of behavioral finance. The book also explores the key components of Shleifer's model of noise trading and explains the importance of this model in the larger context of behavioral finance. Burton and Shah include essential information on noise traders and the law of one price as well as the case of fungibility. The book also contains an exploration of noise trading feedback models such as the Hirshleifer model.
Further, Behavioral Finance reviews serial correlation patterns in stock price data from the perspective of experts such as DeBondt and Thaler. The book puts the Capital Asset Pricing Model to the test and reveals why Fama-French is a milestone for behavioral finance. Along the way, Burton and Shah share their own views on this important area of finance and shed some much needed light on the subject.
