CPSC, Gymboree Corp. Announce Recall of Children's Umbrellas

































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 



August 5, 1997

 



Release # 97-169

 



WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Gymboree Corp. of Burlingame, Calif., is voluntarily recalling about 6,500 children's umbrellas that have surface coating decorations with high levels of lead. This violates the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Act. In addition, about 700 similarly decorated beach and golf umbrellas are being recalled. Ingestion of high levels of lead can present a risk of lead poisoning to young children. Lead poisoning in children is associated with behavior problems, learning disabilities, hearing problems and growth retardation.

CPSC and Gymboree are not aware of any reports of illness involving these umbrellas. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of illness.

The Gymboree umbrellas come in "kid-sized" compact, golf and beach varieties, and are multi-colored with polka-dot, stripe and checkered square panels alternating with solid color panels. The kid-sized compact umbrella has a clown on the purple panel. Model numbers do not appear on the umbrellas, but are on the price tag. The child's umbrella has model number 27000033, the golf umbrella has model number 27000025 and the beach umbrella has model number 27000041.

Gymboree stores sold the umbrellas nationwide from September 1996 through May 1997 for about $12 to $30, depending on the model.

Consumers should take these umbrellas away from children immediately and return them to any Gymboree store for a full refund. For more information about this recall, consumers should contact Gymboree at (800) 558-9885 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. PDT Monday through Friday.




The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

Gymboree Agrees to Sell Play & Music Business to Zeavion
Sale supports Play & Music's global growth, R&D and product innovation

The Gymboree Corporation to enhance focus on its core retail business

SAN FRANCISCO - June 28, 2016 - The Gymboree Corporation ("Gymboree" or the "Company") today announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its early childhood development business, Gymboree Play & Music ("Play & Music"), to ZEAVION Holding ("ZEAVION"), a privately-held company with a focus on the education and entertainment sectors. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Gymboree will receive $127.5 million in cash proceeds from ZEAVION, approximately $80 million net of estimated taxes. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by mid-July, and is subject to certain closing conditions and post-closing purchase price adjustments. If closing does not occur by mid-July, Gymboree has the right to terminate the definitive agreements and retain a $20 million nonrefundable deposit.


Upon closing of the transaction, ZEAVION will own the entire global Play & Music business, including its central operations and centers in North America. ZEAVION has also agreed to acquire the intellectual property of Play & Music's curriculum and certain related trademarks.

"Today marks a positive next step in the growth of Play & Music, which was founded just over 40 years ago," said Mark Breitbard, CEO of Gymboree. "Play & Music pioneered a unique model for giving children around the world the opportunity to learn and grow through art, music and early education. Gymboree is proud to have built a strong foundation for the Play & Music business and we are excited about ZEAVION's commitment to education and plan to grow this great brand. Play & Music is well positioned for this next chapter, while Gymboree will continue to focus on its core retail businesses."


"I am humbled by the opportunity to grow the Play & Music brand with a focus on strengthening its profitability through strategic investments in R&D and product innovation," added Jack Shi, founder of ZEAVION. "I am a longtime, firm believer in the power of education and learning at an early age and its impact on human growth and development.

In 1986, the company opened a chain of clothing stores named Gymboree. Gymboree stores offer coordinating children's clothing. The sizes range from newborn to size ten.

It currently operates 630 Gymboree Retail, 150 Gymboree Outlet, 130 Janie & Jack, and 290 Crazy 8 stores in the US.
Crazy 8 was started in August, 2007. It features lower priced clothing and is Gymboree's direct competitor for The Children's Place and Old Navy.
In June 2017, Gymboree announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the debt management process, it said it would close 375 of its 1300 stores.[5]
Play & Music Centers (no longer owned by The Gymboree Corporation)[edit]




Gymboree Play & Music, Putney Exchange, London, England


In July 2016, The Gymboree Corporation sold the Gymboree Play & Music business to Zeavion Holding, a privately-held company with a focus on the education and entertainment sectors. Gymboree Play & Music is now completely separate from the Gymboree Corporation and is operating parent-child play classes for ages 0-5. Play & Music operates in over 40 countries and has more than 733 centers internationally.[6]

History[edit]
Retail stores[edit]
In 1986, the company opened a chain of clothing stores named Gymboree. Gymboree stores offer coordinating children's clothing. The sizes range from newborn to size ten. Gymboree, in its current incarnation (it has reorganized several times) is incorporated under the Gym-Mark, Inc nameplate. It currently operates 630 Gymboree Retail, 150 Gymboree Outlet, 130 Janie & Jack, and 290 Crazy 8 stores in the US.
Crazy 8 was started in August, 2007. It features lower priced clothing and is Gymboree's direct competitor for The Children's Place and Old Navy.
In June 2017, Gymboree announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the debt management process, it said it would close 375 of its 1300 stores.[5]
Play & Music Centers (no longer owned by The Gymboree Corporation)[edit]




Gymboree Play & Music, Putney Exchange, London, England


In July 2016, The Gymboree Corporation sold the Gymboree Play & Music business to Zeavion Holding, a privately-held company with a focus on the education and entertainment sectors. Gymboree Play & Music is now completely separate from the Gymboree Corporation and is operating parent-child play classes for ages 0-5. Play & Music operates in over 40 countries and has more than 733 centers internationally.[6]
Lawsuits[edit]
In November, 2005, Gymboree settled a lawsuit relating to overtime compensation in Riverside, California for $2.3 million. The lawsuit alleged that Gymboree did not pay some mandatory overtime or provide required meal breaks.[7]

About THE GYMBOREE CORPORATION


   Despite being almost 40 years old, The Gymboree Corp. is still a retail toddler, stumbling periodically, learning quickly, and growing fast. The company sells clothes and accessories for kids in the US, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Australia at about 625 Gymboree stores that carry colorful, fashionable playsuits and rompers for kids up to 12 years old. It also operates some 140 Janie and Jack (better newborn and toddler apparel) and 165-plus Gymboree Outlet stores and corresponding e-commerce sites. Its youngest chain is value-priced Crazy 8. The company also provides parent-child play programs (designed to enhance child development) for newborns to age five. Founded in 1976, Gymboree is owned by Bain Capital.
Faced with a debt tsunami, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017.
Operations

   The youngest and fastest growing of Gymboree's retail concepts is Crazy 8 (launched in 2007), with some 390 locations throughout the US. Crazy 8 stores offer discounted apparel in sizes ranging from newborn up to size 14. The chain's focus on value-priced apparel was a good fit for the thrifty times of the recent recession. The Gymboree and Janie and Jack retail concepts span the price-range of children's clothing; Janie and Jack sells higher-priced apparel than Gymboree stores, and the Gymboree Outlet shops sell lower-priced clothing.
  

   Gymboree Play & Music operates more than 700 franchised and company-operated centers in the US and some 40 other countries, contributing just 2% of annual sales. The Play & Music business also sells developmental toys, books, and music for young children.
  

   The company sources its apparel from more than 230 independent suppliers located primarily in China, which accounts for about a third of the total, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia.  
Geographic Reach

   San Francisco-based Gymboree has about 1,325 stores in the US and more than 40 shops in Canada. It also has about a half a dozen locations in Australia, as well as stores in China, the Middle East, and South Korea.
  
Financial Performance

   Gymboree's sales fell 2% in fiscal 2014 (ended January) versus the prior year, to $1.24 billion, and the company posted a net loss of $203 million. The retailer blamed the decline, which reversed years of steady growth, on lower same-store sales, partially offset by sales from about 60 new locations. (Retail stores account for 96% of the company's sales.) Indeed, same-store sales fell by 6%. Gymboree Play & Music's sales grew 7% to $25.7 million on increased equipment and product sales. Sales from the company's retail franchises increased 30% year over year.
  

   Gymboree has been unprofitable for three consecutive years on increasing operating costs related to its retail operations.
  
Strategy

   Gymboree relies on its multi-tiered portfolio of brands -- from value-priced Crazy 8 to upscale Janie and Jack -- to connect with its target customers -- moms. To that end, the retailer plans to add about 25 new stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2015 (ends January), distributed fairly evenly across its brands. The company expects its international franchise partners to open about 15 to 20 locations over the same period.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
