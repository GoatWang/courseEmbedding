 Enter the terms you wish to search for.  Dr James O'Toole SearchHomeAboutMenNewsLinksSpecialsContact Breast Cancer Care   Using the Most Modern Techniques, We Can HelpWe understand that a breast cancer diagnosis is frightening. At O’Toole Plastic Surgery we are dedicated to working with you, your oncology team and your family to develop a surgical treatment plan that makes sense for you and your specific situation.  Mastectomy, lumpectomy, fat grafting. You may have options.We recognize that every patient’s body composition, anatomy and diagnosis are unique. We do not follow a “one size fits all” surgical philosophy. In fact, we go to great lengths to do just the opposite. We take time to understand your personal situation and customize a surgical plan and approach that makes the most sense for you. Dr. O’Toole is the first plastic surgeon in Pittsburgh to marry the aesthetic-centered incision patterns of cosmetic surgery with the oncological surgical approach, which focuses solely on removing the cancer. He believes that breast cancer removal surgery is not just about preserving life. It’s about making his patients feel better about how they’ll look and feel after the procedure is complete. That dual approach helps his patients heal faster emotionally and physically. You Should Always Expect The BestIdeally, involving Dr. O’Toole at the beginning of your recovery journey is best to maximize the available surgical options. However, engaging him later to correct issues from previous procedures with other surgeons is possible. Regardless, know that your satisfaction with the end result is our priority.WE CAN ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE SURGERIESDr. O’Toole specializes in modern oncoplastic breast reconstruction techniques that utilize a variety of cosmetic incisions to eliminate deformity, hide scars, and help prevent post-radiation problems. Fat grafting is a technique that Dr. O’Toole has mastered to fine-tune breast shape after breast cancer reconstruction surgery. This method can improve lumpectomy deformities and radiation changes throughout the breast.For those needing a mastectomy, Dr. O’Toole is a single stage direct-to-implant breast reconstruction specialist, who tailors his surgical plan based on each individual patient’s unique anatomy and medical situation. Ideally, his goal is to eliminate the expansion process, which minimizes scarring and avoids the need for additional surgeries and/or procedures.breast cancer surgery is eligible for insurance coverage.Rest assured, any breast cancer surgery is eligible for insurance coverage.

 Enter the terms you wish to search for.  Dr James O'Toole SearchHomeAboutMenNewsLinksSpecialsContact Cosmetic Injection   Injectable facial Treatments. You, Only Better.O’Toole Plastic Surgery offers a variety of facial injections to minimize wrinkles and/or redefine your appearance and they can be administered right here in our office. There is little discomfort, no need for a lengthy “recovery time”, and results appear relatively quickly. Best of all, Dr. O’Toole administers all of the treatments himself. He is clinically trained to customize each individual patient’s areas of concern and will discuss each option thoroughly before recommending a treatment plan.Botox®Dysport®Xeomin®Belotero Balance®Restylane®, Restylane® Lyft, Juvéderm® and Prevelle®Juvéderm Voluma®Fat Injection/ Fat TransferKybella®Skin ResurfacingChemical PeelsVI Peel®Laser Skin Resurfacing, or Laser Skin TherapyBotox®The Botox® facial injection is a safe, FDA-approved medication that softens lines and unwanted wrinkles around the eyes, eyebrows, forehead, and mouth.Our Botox® injection techniques will give you a natural, refreshed, less tired, less “angry” look while not interfering with the normal animation of the face.Botox® results become visible within a few days and typically last 3-4 months.Back to topDYSPORT®Dysport® is an FDA-approved injection used get rid of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows. This deep wrinkle treatment rejuvenates frown lines and lines formed during animation. Results are visible within a few days and typically last 3-4 months.XEOMIN®Xeomin ® injection is a prescription medication injected into facial muscles for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines (frown lines) in adult patients. It is recommended to be administered no more frequently than every three months.BELOTERO BALANCE®Belotero Balance® is an FDA-approved injection to help temporarily smooth out and fill in moderate-to-severe nasolabial folds (the folds or wrinkles that go from the side of the nose to the corner of the mouth).Back to topRestylane®, RESTYLANE® LYFT, Juvéderm® and Prevelle®Hyaluronic Acid (HA) is a natural substance that is found within our skin. The prescription product known by the trade names of Restylane®, Restylane Silk®, Restylane® Lyft, Juvéderm Ultra®, Juvéderm Ultra Plus® and Prevelle®. These are popular and effective FDA-approved soft tissue fillers to manage wrinkles, fine lines, contour irregularities, and volume depletion of the face, cheek folds, and lips.Using an ultra fine needle, the facial filler is injected directly under the skin in tiny amounts attracting water within the skin, which fills out the lines on the skin surface and creates a more youthful appearance. Each product is engineered to address specific areas of the face. Dr. O’Toole will share his wealth of expertise on which product will achieve optimal results for you.The procedure is quick to perform, results are immediate, and last up to 6 months. No recovery time is necessary.Back to topJUVéDERM VOLUMA® XCJuvéderm Voluma® XC is the first and only FDA-approved injectable product created to instantly add volume to the mid-face/cheek area to correct age-related volume loss. It can provide contour and a subtle lift for up to two years. No recovery time is necessary.Back to topFat Injection/Fat TransferA patient’s own body fat can be one of the best sources of facial fillers; used to smooth wrinkles, folds, and depressions on the face or any area of the body.Most often, fat transfer (autologous fat transplantation) involves removing fat from the abdomen, buttocks, or thighs and placing it into areas of need in the cheeks and lips, resulting in a plumper, lusher, more youthful look.This is a very natural, non-allergenic office procedure with very little downtime. Fat transfer can be permanent. The effects of the results vary significantly from patient to patient. Fat injection can be an attractive and cost-effective alternative if combined with other procedures such as liposuction.Back to topKYBELLA®Do you have a double chin that just won’t go away? Would you like to re-define your jawline without surgery? Kybella® may be the answer. Kybella® is the first and only FDA-approved injectable treatment to improve the appearance of moderate to severe fat beneath the chin by physically destroying those fat cells. The active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, is a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. Many patients experience visible results in 2 to 4 treatments. Once treatments are complete, results are permanent*. (*Not for some patients). Back to topSkin ResurfacingAging, genetics, and environmental factors such as sun exposure and our habits (alcohol, nutrition, smoking) can influence skin texture, the amount of facial wrinkling and uneven pigmentation.Skin resurfacing, just like all other cosmetic endeavors, needs to be customized to fit your particular skin type and problem.On a visit to our Pittsburgh cosmetic surgery practice, Dr. O’Toole will analyze your skin and your goals to recommend the appropriate skin resurfacing option for you. Common skin resurfacing options include chemical peels and laser skin resurfacing.Back to topChemical PeelsThe chemical peel procedure is generally categorized by the type/strength of the chemical that is used and the extent of the treatment that must be conducted.Chemical peels fall into one of two general categories: Light Peels or Medium/Deep Peels.Generally, a combination of alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in low concentrations is used for the light skin peel, which is usually part of an overall skincare program.Medium and deep facial peels are generally performed with more highly concentrated TCA or Phenol (considered the gold-standard for deep skin resurfacing). These are the strongest peels and are used to treat significant or deep wrinkles.The whole face, or regions of the face, can be treated. The lower eyelids and areas around the mouth and chin are the most common parts of the face for chemical peels.Phenol peels are often performed with eyelid and facelift surgery to enhance overall facial rejuvenation. The effects of these peels are long lasting. Specifically, Phenol has been proven effective in clinical studies spanning over 30 years.The healing time with medium facial peels and deep facial peels vary from 4-10 days depending on the treatment plan that Dr. O’Toole recommends. Normal activities may resume once you have healed. The quality of your skin will improve over 3-6 months, with help from our regimen of customized skincare designed for each patient.Back to topVI PEEL®VI Peel® is a skin treatment used to improve the appearance of the skin on the face, chest, hands or other areas. The VI Peel® is an effective treatment to improve several skin conditions including acne, uneven skin texture, uneven tone, fine lines, wrinkles, acne scarring, sagging skin, age or sun spots, enlarged pores and hyperpigmentation. The VI Peel® also provides a more youthful look by brightening the overall appearance of the skin and improving collagen production. The VI Peel®, like some other chemical peels, can also assist in removing precancerous cells.The VI Peel® is virtually pain-free and has little-to-no down time.Back to topLaser Skin Resurfacing, or Laser Skin TherapyLaser skin resurfacing, or laser skin therapy are similar to the chemical peels in that they all treat deep wrinkles and skin that has suffered a significant amount of sun damage.Similar to the medium facial peel or the deep facial peel, the entire face can be treated, or just certain areas of the face are treated.The healing time with laser skin resurfacing is typically longer than with chemical peels. For that reason, Dr. O’Toole prefers chemical peels, however he is willing to consider laser skin resurfacing on a case-by-case basis.  Back to top Ready to meet Dr. O’Toole?

 Enter the terms you wish to search for.  Dr James O'Toole SearchHomeAboutMenNewsLinksSpecialsContact Facial Rejuvenation   FACIAL SURGERY SHOULD ENHANCE YOUR LOOK, NOT ALTER IT.Surgery to improve facial features should result in enhancing one’s natural attractiveness, not change it to look like someone else. Our practice does not follow a “one size fits all” surgical philosophy. In fact, we go to great lengths to do just the opposite. We take time to understand your personal situation and customize a surgical plan and approach that makes the most sense for you.At our Pittsburgh cosmetic surgery practice, Dr. O’Toole is dedicated to helping you put your best face forward. Our progressive facial rejuvenation surgery methods are safe, minimally invasive, and far more customized than some other practices.Ready to meet Dr. O’Toole? Just callMACS LiftMini LiftEyelid Rejuvenation or Eye LiftForehead Lift or Brow LiftNeck Rejuvenation, Neck Liposuction and Kybella®Chin Surgery–Chin AugmentationCosmetic Ear Surgery/ Torn Earlobe RepairTorn Earlobe RepairMACS liftThe MACS Lift procedure is performed for someone with moderate to severe aging changes of the cheeks, jowls and neck. The deep soft tissues of the face are returned to a more youthful position and then the skin of the face and neck are re-draped (not pulled) over these tissues. This will leave you with a fresh, rejuvenated appearance.Dr. O'Toole was personally trained by the inventor of the procedure of the Minimal Access Cranial Suspension, or MACS facelift procedure. The most modern and minimally scarring facelift procedure, MACS is a short scar facelift operation that yields results most often superior and more natural than a traditional facelift.Mini-LiftThis procedure is performed for someone with early to moderate aging of the cheeks, jowls and neck. With this procedure, the deep soft tissues require less extensive modification and, therefore, the incisions are shorter, allowing for a quicker procedure time and quicker recovery.It is important to remember that the length of time it takes to perform the procedure is not directly correlated with the quality and longevity of the results. In other words, you may only need a mini-lift, due to good bone structure, genetics, general health, and other factors, and the results will be no less dramatic.Back to topEyelid Rejuvenation or Eye LiftOften, the eyelid area is the quickest part of the face to show the signs of age, making you look tired or sad. Eyelids can age more rapidly than even the neck, giving the face a heavier and more tired expression.Eyelid rejuvenation, also known as blepharoplasty or eyelift is a procedure that effectively treats eyelid aging via a careful removal of excess skin and bags around the upper and lower eyelids. The result of an eyelift is a more youthful, happier, and refreshed look.Treating lower eyelids can be done in one of two ways. In some cases, lower eyelid bags can be removed from the inside of the lower eyelid, avoiding an external scar. In others, an incision just below the eyelashes is needed, to remove the excess skin and "fat bags."Eyelift surgery is safe, and at our Pittsburgh plastic surgery practice, we use conservatism and precision to create a very natural-looking end result.If eyebrow descent contributes to drooping of the upper eyelid it may be wise to perform a forehead lift, or brow lift simultaneously.Back to topForehead Lift or Brow LiftA forehead lift or brow lift is often recommended in conjunction with eyelid and facelift procedures to provide facial balance and consistency.The brow lift procedure is designed to treat the lines of the forehead, droopy eyebrows and the heavy upper eyelids that can give the face a tired, angry or sad look.By gently and subtly elevating the brow, weight is taken off of the upper eyelid, and the eyes are "opened" for a natural, more youthful, refreshed look. In some cases, excess upper eyelid skin and bags are contributing to the tired look, and eyelift surgery is performed at the same time.Back to topNeck Rejuvenation, Neck Liposuction and kybella®Neck rejuvenation can be achieved a number of ways. Depending on the desired results, some patients may require a surgical procedure like liposuction which requires a small incision underneath the chin. Other patients may prefer a series of cosmetic injections using Kybella®, where no surgery is required. Kybella® is an in-office treatment that dissolves the fat cells beneath the chin, allowing for a more defined look. For more information on Kybella, click here.While neck rejuvenation surgery and neck liposuction are generally performed in conjunction with the facelift, under certain circumstances, the neck alone may be surgically treated to improve contour and create a more youthful appearance.As always, Dr. O’Toole will discuss all of your options to provide the best possible outcome.Back to topChin Surgery: Chin Augmentation or Chin ImplantChin augmentation gives individuals with recessed or small chins a stronger-looking profile and a more balanced look. The chin augmentation procedure can be performed as a stand-alone procedure or in tandem with other procedures. Chin surgery can be performed quickly, with little bruising, and a rapid recovery.The procedure is accomplished via a small incision either through the mouth or through the natural crease under the chin. An implant is then inserted over the chin. In unique circumstances, fat grafting alone can be used to augment the chin. Dr. O’Toole can help you decide which procedure is best given your unique anatomy.There are a number of procedures that are very commonly performed in combination with chin implant. A weak chin may accompany a nose that is too large. In this case, a very pleasing overall profile and facial balance can be accomplished via rhinoplasty coupled with a chin implant.The undesirable combination of a weak chin and fatty neck can be vastly improved through a combination of chin implant and neck liposuction. Similarly, a chin implant may be recommended in conjunction with facelift and/or neck rejuvenation to enhance overall jawline and a more attractive outcome.Back to topCosmetic Ear SurgeryCosmetic ear surgery can easily solve the issue of the congenital protruding ear. Cosmetic ear surgery, or otoplasty, sometimes involves ear lobe reduction, and is designed to make the ear lie closer to the head.This procedure can be performed with minimal scarring and recovery time.Cosmetic ear surgery involves making a small incision on the backside of the ear. The cartilage of the ear is then reshaped to create an attractive look. The natural look of the ear, including the natural folds, is recreated during this precise process.Back to topTorn Earlobe RepairCosmetic ear surgery can take many forms. Dr. O'Toole has years and diversity of experience surgically repairing ears that have been gauged, pierced or torn as a result of an accident. In fact, he has pioneered a method to repairing ear deformities with patients reporting that they look and feel as if there had been no injury or alteration of the ear whatsoever.Back to top Ready to meet Dr. O’Toole?

 nose surgery | rhinoplasty surgery | Pittsburgh cosmetic surgery




















 Enter the terms you wish to search for.  Dr James O'Toole SearchHomeAboutMenNewsLinksSpecialsContact Cosmetic Nose Surgery   Feeling Confident About How You Look Is PossibleConsidering a change to your facial features can be overwhelming. Dr. O’Toole understands the emotional challenges and feelings of uncertainty that accompany the decision to pursue cosmetic surgery. His approach to patient care aims at ensuring that his patients are comfortable with the treatment plan and happy with the end result.Achieving a more balanced, symmetrical look, may involve cosmetic surgery of the nose, often referred to as rhinoplasty. This procedure is designed to refit the nose to help it conform to the rest of your facial features.Rhinoplasty is often used to reduce the size of the nose, or to reshape the nose. It can improve a nose that is too large for the face, one that has a bump or depression on its bridge, or correct a nose that is too wide. Nose surgery can reduce the width of the tip of the nose, treat a droopy tip, as well as straighten a crooked nose.In some cases, rhinoplasty surgery is also used to improve breathing. It can widen nasal passages or correct a deviated septum.Some nose surgery procedures can be performed from incisions within the nose, meaning there will be no external incisions. Some involve making a small incision across the vertical strip of tissue that separates the nostrils, called the columella. And some, particularly in the case of nostril reduction, can require a small incision at the base of each nostril.In a small percentage of cases, a chin implant or chin augmentation procedure may be conducted at the same time, to give the face more balance and further improve the overall aesthetic affect.Dr. O’Toole individualizes every patient’s experience. During your initial visit to our Pittsburgh cosmetic surgery practice, he will listen carefully to your concerns, will answer all of your questions and will devise a treatment plan that feels comfortable for you.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIn his sixteenth-century masterpiece, The Prince, Niccolo Machiavelli advised leaders to "learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use it according to the necessity of the case. Under the guise of modern-day "situational leadership, organizations still take refuge in this outdated theory. James O'Toole argues that such amoral leadership is ineffective. Instead, he shows that successful leadership is ultimately rooted in high moral purpose and the consistent display of respect for followers.In Leading Change, O'Toole transcends how-to management primers by offering an unorthodox approach to leadership based on the lessons of history, moral and political philosophy, and the practical experience of men and women across cultures and circumstances—including the Rushmorean presidents. As a springboard for this provocative treatise on overcoming resistance to change, O'Toole uses artist James Ensor's painting, Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889. He explains how modern men and women can lead effectively from the middle of today's inattentive crowd of individualists by enlisting and including all followers in the process.Review"A compelling book! Jim O'Toole argues convincingly that the complexity and turmoil of our time demands leadership that is right--not leadership that simply works." (Kermit Campbell, CEO, Herman Miller, Inc.)SynopsisIn Leading Change, James O'Toole argues that outdated Machiavellian dictates of situational leadership are ultimately ineffective--and demonstrates instead that successful leadership is rooted in high moral purpose and consistent respect for followers.SynopsisIn his sixteenth century masterpiece, The Prince, Niccolo Machiavelli advised leaders to "learn how not to be good," and moreover, to use this knowledge regardless of individual case. Under the guise of modern day "situational leadership," organizations still take refuge in this outdated theory. In Leading Change, James O'Toole argues that such amoral practices are ultimately ineffective—and demonstrates instead that successful leadership is rooted in high moral purpose and consistent respect for followers.DescriptionIncludes bibliographical references (p. 263-272) and index.About the AuthorJAMES O'TOOLE is a noted authority on leadership and vice president of The Aspen Institute, where he directs the renowned program as Executive Seminar and the Corporate Leaders Forum.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
