"We can extrapolate from the study that for the long term individual investor who maintains a consistent asset allocation and leans toward index funds, asset allocation determines about 100% of performance."
Roger Ibbotson, Ph.D. Professor of Finance -Yale University. Ibbotson Associates. Author: The True Impact of Asset Allocation on Returns"Q. So investors shouldn’t delude themselves about beating the market? A. “They’re just not going to do it. It’s just not going to happen."
Daniel Kahneman,Ph.D. Psychology, Noble Laureate in Economics"This message (that attempting to beat the market is futile) can never be sold on Wall Street because it is in effect telling stock analysts to drop dead."
Paul A. Samuelson, Ph.D. Philosophy Professor of Economics, MIT, Economist, Nobel Laureate in Economics"Wall Street’s favorite scam is pretending that luck is skill."
Ron Ross, Ph.D. Economics Former Professor of Economics, Humboldt State University Author: The Unbeatable Market"If there’s 10,000 people looking at the stocks and trying to pick winners, one in 10,000 is going to score, by chance alone, and that’s all that’s going on. It’s a game, it’s a chance operation, and people think they are doing something purposeful…but they’re really not."

Securities and Exchange Commission
Registered investment advisors must register with the SEC if they have more than $100MM in assets under management (AUM).  Those advisors with a lower AUM must register with individual states. Investment advisors who are registered with both the SEC and FINRA typically operate as both advisors and broker-dealers; thus they can advise on securities and be paid a commission for transacting trades.  Independent investment advisors typically are registered only with the SEC. That said, it is possible for an investment advisor to register solely with the SEC and to be affiliated with a broker-dealer. Registered investment advisors that are not affiliated with a broker-dealer are typically independent. You can view more about how an advisor receives remuneration by accessing Parts 5, 6, and 7 of the firm’s Form ADV I (click on Check Out Advisors and Brokers on the SEC homepage).
FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)
>Broker-dealers and agents of broker-dealers register with FINRA.  You can research the background of a broker-dealer representative using BrokerCheck.  Investment advisor firms registered with FINRA, in addition to the SEC or state, are typically affiliated with a broker-dealer.

FAQs












What is a multi-family office group?




A multi-family office is a firm that offers cross-generational investment counsel and cash management services to a select few wealthy families. Such a service exists to protect and grow client wealth, while handling the daily rigors of financial management.
Who has control of my assets?
You do. Custodial services are provided by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and to the extent that you give us written permission. Schwab will permit Yale Capital to move funds according to your instructions, as well as execute trades.
Standing letters of authorization permit us to move money into accounts of different registrations — you can simply call us to instruct money movements as often as you need. For funds transferred to accounts with different registrations, for which we do not have a standing letter of authorization, your signature will be required.
We will do the leg work — all you have to do is sign an authorization document and provide verbal permission to initiate the transfer.
What are some of the due diligence activities I should carry out when considering advisors?
1. First, consider whether or not your advisor is an independent advisor, or an advisor working for a broker-dealer. A registered investment advisor (RIA) is legally required to put the client’s interests before their own, while a registered representative working for a broker-dealer answers also to his/her broker-dealer. Whether or not your advisor is independent, make sure they are paid solely by clients. If an advisor is a registered investment advisor and also hold a Series 7, registered with FINRA, they may be paid by being an RIA and as broker-dealer. You can view more related information in the Useful Links section below.
2. Make sure any performance numbers presented to you are actually those of the advisor with whom you are speaking, and not those of an advisor that they recommend to you or that they represent.
3. Enquire about fee structure and how fees are calculated. Ask for a detailed breakdown of ALL the costs involved in managing your portfolio—not just the advisor’s fee, but fund fees too.
4. You can research the backgrounds of investment advisor representatives through FINRA and the SEC. All registered representatives of both advisors and broker-dealers should be searchable on these sites.
5. Ask to read the advisor’s ADV Part 2. This document should explain their practices in-depth.
6. Ask who will be making decisions about your portfolio and what their credentials are.
7. Consider whether the advisor’s approach aligns with your own investment philosophy.
8. Find out where your assets will be held.  Ideally, your assets should be held with an unaffiliated, qualified custodian (bank registered or broker-dealer) that has legally mandated safeguards to protect your assets and is SIPC insured.

Tweet










CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.




Shares of CA (NASDAQ CA) opened at 34.06 on Monday. The company’s 50 day moving average price is $33.34 and its 200 day moving average price is $32.43. The stock has a market capitalization of $14.23 billion, a P/E ratio of 18.41 and a beta of 0.87. CA has a one year low of $30.01 and a one year high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th. The technology company reported $0.54 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.05. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion during the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $996.59 million. CA had a return on equity of 17.15% and a net margin of 19.20%.
