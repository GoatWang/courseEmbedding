                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

PART�II � OTHER INFORMATION 
Item�2.�Legal Proceedings.  Disclosure from
Citibank, N.A., as Certificate Administrator:
 On June 18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank, N.A. (�Citibank�) in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of
contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank�s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts.�On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action.�On the same day, a
smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court.�In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs� original state court action.�Citibank�s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of May 13,
2015.�On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. That case, involving the three remaining trusts, is pending. 
On November 24, 2015, the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25
private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee.�This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in the federal action, and one additional trust.�The investors assert claims for breach of
contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York�s Streit Act.�Citibank filed a motion to dismiss this case on February 26, 2016. 
On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as Receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the
Southern District of New York.�This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee.�FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract, violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture
Act. Citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and whose cases are all in front of Judge Carter. Defendants� joint
motion to dismiss was fully briefed as of March 22, 2016.  There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation
on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.�However, Citibank denies liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations.�Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving
Citibank will materially affect Citibank�s ability to perform its duties as Certificate Administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this CMBS transaction.

None
 Item�4.�Defaults Upon Senior Securities.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mtge Trust 2013-GCJ11 Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





April 10, 2013 05:36 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2013-GCJ11 (US CMBS)
    

http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=705058


      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on CGCMT 2013-GCJ11 Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$75,176,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$290,426,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$236,220,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,911,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$104,083,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$21,118,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,102,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      aPrivately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 9, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $42,236,945 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 72 loans secured by 137 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.207 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Jefferies LoanCore LLC, 
      Archetype Mortgage Capital LLC, and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 73.5% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis and asset summary reviews on 83.2% of the pool.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      Loan Diversity: The loan concentration index (LCI) and sponsor 
      concentration index (SCI) are 302 and 343, respectively, representing 
      one of the most diverse conduit pools by loan size and exposure since 
      2008. The top 10 loans represent 46.1% of the pool, lower than the 2012 
      average concentration of 54.2%.
    

      High Hotel Concentration: The pool has a lower concentration of retail 
      and office properties, compared to recent transactions. In addition, 
      hotels consist of 21.4% of the pool, plus one mixed-use property (5.8%) 
      with a significant hotel component. Five of the top 15 loans are secured 
      by hotels or mixed-use with hotel.
    

      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has coverage in line with and higher 
      leverage than rated 2012 deals. The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.25x 
      and 103.2%, respectively, compared to the 2012 average of 1.24x and 
      97.1%.
    

      Amortization: Full interest-only loans account for 4.6% of the pool, and 
      partial interest-only loans account for 30.2% of the pool, which is in 
      line with the average sum in 2012 deals of 33.1%. The pool pays down 
      15.1% from cutoff date to maturity, based on loans' scheduled maturity 
      balances.
    

      Rating Sensitivities
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.8% below the 
      most recent trailing 12 month (TTM) period net operating income (NOI) 
      (for properties that a recent TTM NOI was provided, excluding properties 
      that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further 
      declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and Loss 
      Severity on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating 
      actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the 
      ratings assigned to CGCMT 2013-GCJ11 certificates and found that the 
      transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In 
      a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a 
      more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's 
      NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could 
      result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities in the Rating Sensitivity and Rating Stresses 
      sections of the presale.
    

      The Master Servicers will be Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., rated 'CMS2' by 
      Fitch. The special servicers will be LNR Partners, LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by 
      Fitch.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
