Cianna Medical, Inc. Key Developments

Cianna Medical, Inc. Announces Next Generation Technology SCOUT® Radar Localization System to Provide Instant Response and Real-Time Distance Measurement
Jul 26 17
Cianna Medical, Inc. announced that a next generation SCOUT® radar localization system is currently undergoing clinical validation and expects to announce its commercial availability in the fourth quarter of this year. This proprietary SCOUT technology will enable unprecedented instant response and real-time distance measurement for localizing non-palpable tumors during breast lesion excision surgery, making it the most advanced localizing system in the industry. With SCOUT, a highly sophisticated reflector is precisely placed at the tumor site up to 30 days before a lumpectomy or surgical biopsy. During the procedure, the surgeon scans the breast using the SCOUT guide, which transmits 50 million pulses per second, to lock on to the reflector position. The console delivers instant response feedback when the guide comes in contact with the skin, providing both audible and visual indicators. The next generation SCOUT will measure and display distance in millimeters with 1mm accuracy, allowing surgeons to optimize their breast conservation strategies. SCOUT, an FDA-cleared, non-radioactive, wire-free radar breast tumor localization system, is the world's only technology that utilizes radar in human tissue. Previously published data establish SCOUT as an accurate and reliable method to localize and excise breast lesions. Since its market introduction in 2015, SCOUT has been adopted at over 150 leading medical facilities across the United States and it has been used in more than 15,000 patient procedures to date.


Cianna Medical, Inc. Appoints David M. Renzi to Board of Directors

Cianna Medical, Inc. announced David M. Renzi has been elected to the Board of Directors. Mr. Renzi was most recently CEO of Carbylan Therapeutics, a publicly traded company focused on the development of a next generation injectable for treating pain in the knee joint caused by osteoarthritis. Prior to this he was the CEO of Neomend, a commercial developer of sealants and adhesion barrier products utilizing hydrogel technology. David was also the worldwide Vice President of Sales and Marketing and Chief Commercial Officer for Novacept and SURGRX, both privately held venture-backed companies with successful exits. He spent the early half of his career at the Ethicon and Ethicon Endosurgery divisions of Johnson and Johnson where he was given responsibility for numerous business disciplines to include sales, sales management, marketing management and new procedure development.


Cianna Medical, Inc. Announces New Data Demonstrating Proprietary SCOUT® Radar Localization System
Apr 6 17
Cianna Medical, Inc. announced new data demonstrating the proprietary SCOUT® radar localization system is clinically equivalent to radio seed localization (RSL) for surgical targeting of non-palpable breast lesions. The results were presented at the 2017 SBI/ACR Breast Imaging Symposium, taking place in Los Angeles from April 6, 2017 to April 9, 2017. The retrospective study evaluated 119 patients who underwent breast conserving therapy using SCOUT radar localization (n=59) or RSL (n=60), a technique that utilizes a radioactive seed to target tumors. In all cases, the average volume of resection and repeat surgery rates were equal and markers were successfully removed. SCOUT, an FDA-cleared radar localization system, is a zero-radiation, wire-free solution for breast tumor localization. The novel technology, which is encapsulated in a device smaller than a grain of rice, has received rapid adoption at medical facilities across the U.S. and numerous technology awards, offers several benefits over previous localization methods, including unmatched precision to 1mm, 100% OR compatibility, simplified scheduling, optimal surgical planning and guidance, improved efficiencies and higher patient and physician satisfaction. At the conclusion of the study, seven participating radiologists were surveyed about their experiences with both technologies. All radiologists agreed that there was a minimal learning curve associated with radar localization and reported that seed localization was easier than wire localization to learn and implement. The authors concluded that SCOUT is equivalent to RSL with respect to ease of device placement and subsequent removal.

Cianna Medical, Inc. Announces FDA Clearance For SAVI SCOUT® Surgical Guidance System

		  - Late-Breaking Data From Pilot Study on New Electromagnetic Wave Device For Tissue Targeting During Breast Conservation Surgery at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium -
		

Dec 10, 2014, 18:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Cianna Medical, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SAN ANTONIO, Dec. 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Cianna Medical, Inc. announced today U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for the SAVI SCOUT® surgical guidance system, a novel technology that uses real-time audible and visual indicators to give surgeons a precise way to target tissue during lumpectomy and excisional biopsy procedures. SAVI SCOUT is the newest addition to the Cianna Medical family of products, which also includes the innovative SAVI® breast brachytherapy applicator.
The SAVI SCOUT surgical guidance system uses non-radioactive, electromagnetic wave technology to detect a reflector that can be placed in the target tissue up to seven days prior to surgery. During the procedure, the surgeon then uses the SAVI SCOUT handpiece, which emits infrared light and electromagnetic waves, to locate the reflector and plan the incision. The surgeon then removes the reflector and the target tissue.
"The SAVI SCOUT surgical guidance system has a high degree of utility and we believe the system will enable us to improve care for our breast conservation surgery patients," said Charles E. Cox, M.D., Professor of Surgery and McCann Foundation Endowed Professor of Breast Surgery, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Fla. "I found the system to be highly intuitive and expect that we will see fairly rapid uptake of the SAVI SCOUT in breast centers across the country."
Results from a pilot study evaluating successful placement, localization and retrieval of the SAVI SCOUT were presented as part of the late breaking scientific sessions at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium today. The study, which included 24 patients, resulted in 100% surgical success using SAVI SCOUT. In all cases, the target tissue and reflector were successfully removed; there were no incidents of reflector migration or adverse events. Pathology reports showed clear margins in comparable numbers to radioactive seed location.
The goal in breast-conservation surgery is to remove all detectable cancer cells. Of the estimated 174,000 women who have breast conservation surgery each year, approximately 30% will require repeat surgery because cancer cells are not completely removed during the first procedure.
Developed more than 20 years ago, the standard preoperative technique for localizing non-palpable breast lesions is wire localization. With this procedure, a wire is inserted into the breast by a radiologist to guide the surgeon to the target tissue. The time between wire placement and surgery can be several hours and, in addition to potentially being unpleasant for women, the process presents scheduling challenges for surgeons, radiologists and hospital staff. 
Radioactive seed localization (RSL) was developed as an alternative to wire localization. Despite some proven advantages, the adoption of RSL has been impacted by considerable regulatory requirements and precautions for the safe handling of radioactive materials. 
"We believe that SAVI SCOUT provides two major advantages: First, the reflector can be comfortably placed several days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery by a radiologist or in the operating room by a surgeon. Second, the SAVI SCOUT handpiece can be used with retractors so, as the dissection proceeds, we receive immediate, real-time guidance for the lumpectomy," said Pat Whitworth, M.D., Director, Nashville Breast Center, Nashville, Tenn. "We are finding SAVI SCOUT eliminates the need to stop for intraoperative ultrasound; we can now use imaging only before and after the resection. I expect it's going to be a welcome advance for surgeons and patients."
The pilot study with SAVI SCOUT is ongoing at the University of South Florida College of Medicine and the Nashville Breast Center. Cianna Medical plans to bring the technology to additional medical centers over the course of 2015 and will be supporting product uptake with professional education and ongoing reporting on data and case studies from the clinical program.
"Cianna Medical adheres to a patient-centric mission and the introduction of SAVI SCOUT is an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to delivering innovative products that improve patient outcomes and quality of life," said Jill Anderson, CEO, Cianna Medical. "SAVI SCOUT is an optimal addition to our market leading SAVI family and we believe it has the potential to reduce surgical delays, improve patient satisfaction, and optimize surgical planning – all without radioactive components. We look forward to bringing this new technology to the breast cancer community."
