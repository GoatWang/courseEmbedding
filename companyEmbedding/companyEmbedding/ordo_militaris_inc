Introduction
The Ordo Militaris Catholicus is a international defense and security initiative of Catholics for Catholics who are suffering persecution for their faith, where their defense and liberation requires military intervention or security actions, and this is allowed by local and/or international law. We were founded in the days following the martyrdom of Father Jacques Hamel, July 26, 2017 A.D., by Br. Alexis Bugnolo, a Franciscan hermit.

In the U.S.A., the Order has founded a Montana Corporation, with the legal name, Ordo Militaris, Inc., as a Private Military Corporation, to conduct the defense and security initiatives that the Association seeks to undertake.
To know more about how you can help or join the Order, see our Sign-up page or our Donations page or Investment Page. To read more about the Order and its form of organization, read about the Justice of Our Cause, or Our Holy Rule, and about how everyone can help us get the word out.

Also, if you like, take the time to learn what our insignia signifies.
You can also watch a videos about the initiative and the corporation:  about A Complete Explanation of our Association,  Or Listen to our numerous Radio programs, at Ordo Militaris Radio:  click on Cross here =>.
The Order seeks to recruit chiefly Catholic Veterans who wish to put their military skills and knowledge to service in the defense of fellow Catholics, and this principally out of a desire of fraternal charity, not personal gain. As a religious association of Catholics we aim to combine the unique aspects of military and religious service as a work of mercy towards our fellow Catholics.
About the Ordo Militaris, Inc.
Following in the footsteps of the brave Catholics of old, who forsook family, home and nation to go overseas to the rescue of Christians being persecuted for their faith, we have begun this security and defense initiative of Catholics for Christians who are being persecuted, where their defense and security requires humanitarian aid and security solutions which only a private military corporation could lawfully provide.
We aim to be a non-political, transnational humanitarian effort with a distinctively Catholic ethos and spirit, providing a method of private collaboration and intervention separate from the national foreign policies of sovereign states, while working fully within the limitations of national and international laws and conventions.
While engaging principally in humanitarian relief efforts, either directly or through the provision of security solutions, we intend a robust business strategy to offer our services to existing humanitarian efforts who have need of private security solutions in those areas of the world which are high risk, as the principal foundation of our business strategy.
At present, throughout the western world, there exists no such particularly Christian effort which blends security and defense with humanitarian aid, in part because classical charities or non profits are excluded from security and defense activities and programs and in part because in recent centuries the concept of security and defense as a humanitarian activity has all but been forgotten.
As part of our transnational strategy, we are currently seeking to establish subsidiaries overseas so as to increase the multifaceted advantages of an international presence and to take advantage of the unique resources and talents of Catholics who participate in our effort from throughout the Catholic world.
As a Montana Corporation directed by Catholics with deeply held religious beliefs we hope to provide unique solutions with an extremely high ethical rigor, in an age which sees increasingly religion as a security problem not a solution.  We are formed as a private military corporation, for profit, so that we might be capable in US law to apply for government defense contracts, fund the security and military needs of lawful Christian initiatives overseas and train and prepare volunteers who wish to serve with us on overseas missions. We are committed to being a corporation led by and employing principally US Military Veterans who see and wish to serve Jesus Christ as the King of Kings and the Prince of Peace.  In this way, we hope to offer veterans an utterly unique way to put their skills and experience to work defending their innocent and helpless brothers in Christ the world over.
Other Chapters
We are also forming Chapters in other Nations such as Poland (see our Contact Page).

7 Ways to Invest with Us
First, we are a Montana Corporation authorized to sell stock.
Ordo Militaris Radio Program on Investing
We currently have 2 private series of issues, offered publicly in accord with the SEC Rule 506(c). Each of these issues can be purchased by accredited individuals or institutions. See our prospectuses for more information. And listen to our Ordo Militaris Radio program, about both of these issues, which contains important and very useful information for prospective investors. (Click the Cross to the Right to listen)

Our Series Y01 throughY99 Stocks Series is dedicated to the capital expenses to set up a Basic Combat Training Camp and a US National HQ.  To obtain a copy of the prospectus, click here.
Our Series T01 through T99 Stocks Series is dedicated to the capital expenses to establish foreign subsidiaries. To obtain a copy of the prospectus, click here.


Second, we are accepting beneficial loans of any amount, large or small for 2 or more years at 0% interest, from those willing to support the Order in its need to make capital investments.
Third, you can make your business or church a point of fundraising for the Order by offering leaflets or setting up a donation can to accept offers. Contact our main office in Wyoming for more information about this.
Fourth, if you run a store or business you can offer to resell our promotional products which feature the Insignia of our Order to those who want in this way to help us fund the needs of the soldiers whom we support. If you are a manufacturer, we can also offer you a license to use our Insignia on your products, for our mutual benefit.
Fifth, if you own a business and wish to contribute to the support of the Order you can name the Order as the beneficiary of your charitable donations at Christmas time, or grant us a share of stock in your corporation.
Sixth, if you own stock or bonds in other corporations you can donate them to the order, or set aside a portion of your investment income and donate it to the order. Likewise, you can name the Order as a beneficiary of a family or corporate trust, or in your will, that you might support our fight even from the world to come and prepare your way on high with a most sacred recommendation to the King of Kings, Our Lord and Commander.
Seventh, if you own a successful business you can offer to sell it to the Order in exchange for our common stock and thus devote both a portion of its financial profits to the Order’s needs as well as make all the good works you do for your business share in the supernatural merit of the work of the Order. Such a consideration is a momentous one, and would require extensive consultation and advisement with the leadership of the Order.

The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, (Latin: Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani, OSMTH), is a self-styled order and international NGO. OSMTH is often referred to as Knights Templar International (OSMTH-KTI).
OSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the Larmenius Charter as historically valid,[1] but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar.[2]
OSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity,[3] and engages in diplomatic and humanitarian works.[4]

History[edit]
The self-styled l'Ordre du Temple, founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, [5] and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805;[6] In 1945, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960) claimed that the OSMTH was the continuation of l'Ordre du Temple,[7][8] Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960. [7]
In 1970, a split occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970.[9] Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: "Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem" (OSMTJ). Those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fontes continued to be referred to by the Latin translation: "Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani" (OSMTH).
In 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Fernando de Sousa Fonte from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fonte forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH, now known as OSMTH-KTI (Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani - Knights Templar International).
While OSMTH-KTI's rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website[1] and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea,[10] there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH between OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.
In 2001, the Order was accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation, in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status.[11] The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy,[4] which was founded by one of OSMTH's members.[3] In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.[citation needed]
Organisation[edit]
The order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. In America, the order is known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc (this being the English rendering of the Latin name).[12] They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled "Knights Templar", or the Masonic Knights Templar.
OSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England & Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia and in the United States.[13][14] OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid [15] such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.[16]
The ecumenical organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals.[17] As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.[18]
Christian men who join the organisation are self-styled as "Knights" with the title of Chevalier and females are termed "Dames" with the title of Chevaleresse (or Chevalière).[19] The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.[20]
The royal patron of the OSMTH is HH Princess Elizabeth of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach (b. 1945). She is the widow of HSH Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach and the eldest daughter of Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1913-1989). [21]
Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ)[edit]
The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) is an American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH).[17] branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani.[22][23] This name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.
Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ)[edit]
As mentioned in History, OSMTJ was formed by a faction of OSMTH in 1970. It was headed by General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski , until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994.[24] George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ Grand Master today.[25]

The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, (Latin: Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani, OSMTH), is a self-styled order and international NGO. OSMTH is often referred to as Knights Templar International (OSMTH-KTI).
OSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the Larmenius Charter as historically valid,[1] but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar.[2]
OSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity,[3] and engages in diplomatic and humanitarian works.[4]

History[edit]
The self-styled l'Ordre du Temple, founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, [5] and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805;[6] In 1945, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960) claimed that the OSMTH was the continuation of l'Ordre du Temple,[7][8] Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960. [7]
In 1970, a split occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970.[9] Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: "Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem" (OSMTJ). Those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fontes continued to be referred to by the Latin translation: "Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani" (OSMTH).
In 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Fernando de Sousa Fonte from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fonte forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH, now known as OSMTH-KTI (Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani - Knights Templar International).
While OSMTH-KTI's rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website[1] and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea,[10] there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH between OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.
In 2001, the Order was accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation, in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status.[11] The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy,[4] which was founded by one of OSMTH's members.[3] In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.[citation needed]
Organisation[edit]
The order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. In America, the order is known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc (this being the English rendering of the Latin name).[12] They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled "Knights Templar", or the Masonic Knights Templar.
OSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England & Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia and in the United States.[13][14] OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid [15] such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.[16]
The ecumenical organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals.[17] As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.[18]
Christian men who join the organisation are self-styled as "Knights" with the title of Chevalier and females are termed "Dames" with the title of Chevaleresse (or Chevalière).[19] The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.[20]
The royal patron of the OSMTH is HH Princess Elizabeth of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach (b. 1945). She is the widow of HSH Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach and the eldest daughter of Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1913-1989). [21]
Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ)[edit]
The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) is an American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH).[17] branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani.[22][23] This name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.
Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ)[edit]
As mentioned in History, OSMTJ was formed by a faction of OSMTH in 1970. It was headed by General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski , until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994.[24] George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ Grand Master today.[25]

The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, (Latin: Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani, OSMTH), is a self-styled order and international NGO. OSMTH is often referred to as Knights Templar International (OSMTH-KTI).
OSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the Larmenius Charter as historically valid,[1] but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar.[2]
OSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity,[3] and engages in diplomatic and humanitarian works.[4]

History[edit]
The self-styled l'Ordre du Temple, founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, [5] and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805;[6] In 1945, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960) claimed that the OSMTH was the continuation of l'Ordre du Temple,[7][8] Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960. [7]
In 1970, a split occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970.[9] Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: "Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem" (OSMTJ). Those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fontes continued to be referred to by the Latin translation: "Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani" (OSMTH).
In 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Fernando de Sousa Fonte from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Fernando de Sousa Fonte forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH, now known as OSMTH-KTI (Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani - Knights Templar International).
While OSMTH-KTI's rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website[1] and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea,[10] there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH between OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.
In 2001, the Order was accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation, in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status.[11] The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy,[4] which was founded by one of OSMTH's members.[3] In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.[citation needed]
Organisation[edit]
The order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. In America, the order is known as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc (this being the English rendering of the Latin name).[12] They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled "Knights Templar", or the Masonic Knights Templar.
OSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England & Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia and in the United States.[13][14] OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid [15] such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.[16]
The ecumenical organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals.[17] As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.[18]
Christian men who join the organisation are self-styled as "Knights" with the title of Chevalier and females are termed "Dames" with the title of Chevaleresse (or Chevalière).[19] The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.[20]
The royal patron of the OSMTH is HH Princess Elizabeth of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach (b. 1945). She is the widow of HSH Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach and the eldest daughter of Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1913-1989). [21]
Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ)[edit]
The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) is an American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH).[17] branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani.[22][23] This name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.
Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem (OSMTJ)[edit]
As mentioned in History, OSMTJ was formed by a faction of OSMTH in 1970. It was headed by General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski , until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994.[24] George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ Grand Master today.[25]
