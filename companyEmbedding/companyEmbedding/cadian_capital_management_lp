Cadian Capital Management Nominates Four Director Candidates for Election to the Board of Directors of Comverse Technology

Mar 28, 2012, 08:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Cadian Capital Management, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, March 28, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadian Capital Management, LLC ("Cadian Capital"), through one of its investment funds, Cadian Fund LP ("Cadian Fund"), today announced that it has nominated four highly-qualified, independent director nominees to the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Comverse Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CMVT) (the "Company") to replace four directors whose terms expire at the Company's 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Cadian Capital, together with Cadian Fund and certain of its affiliates, beneficially owns 4,186,158 shares of common stock of the Company.  Cadian Fund delivered formal written notice of its nomination to the Company in accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws on March 28, 2012.  
Cadian Capital's highly-qualified, independent director nominees, who will bring substantial business, financial, operational and investment experience to the Board, are:

Stephen Andrews.  Mr. Andrews has over 25 years of global experience in the telecommunications and IT industry and significant business and management experience.  Mr. Andrews is currently an independent Technology, Media & Telecommunications advisor and investor at AbbeyBarn Communications Limited.  Previously, Mr. Andrews held a variety of executive positions at BT Group plc, a global communications services provider, including Group Managing Director of BT Mobility & Convergence and Managing Director of Strategy and Products at BT Retail, where he supervised approximately 500 employees and executives, President of the International Carrier and Networks Business of BT Global Services, and Director of European Alliances at BT Europe.   
James Budge.  Mr. Budge has significant operational and financial expertise in the software and technology industry and is currently the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Rovi Corporation, a global provider of digital entertainment technology solutions.  Previously, Mr. Budge served as the Chief Financial Officer of each of Trados, Inc., an enterprise management software provider, Sendmail, Inc., a secure email provider, and CrossWorlds Software, Inc., a provider of business infrastructure software. 
Doron Inbar.  Mr. Inbar has extensive management, investment and financial expertise and is currently a Venture Partner at Carmel Ventures, an Israeli-based venture capital firm that invests primarily in early stage companies in the fields of Software, Communications, Semiconductors, Internet, Media, and Consumer Electronics.  Previously, Mr. Inbar worked for over 22 years at ECI Telecom Ltd., a global telecom networking infrastructure provider, and held a variety of executive positions including, President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Inbar currently serves on the board of directors of Alvarion Ltd.   
Richard N. Nottenburg, Ph.D.  Dr. Nottenburg has extensive executive management, financial and transactional experience in the commercial wireless communications industry.  Dr. Nottenburg currently serves as a member of the board of directors of Aeroflex Holding Corp. and PMC-Sierra, Inc.  Dr. Nottenburg previously served as President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of Sonus Networks, Inc. and held a variety of executive positions at Motorola, Inc., including Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Technology Officer.  While at Motorola, Dr. Nottenburg was responsible for shaping Motorola's overall corporate strategy. Dr. Nottenburg served on the Board of Directors of the Company from December 2006 to November 2011 and on the board of directors of Verint Systems, Inc. from July 2011 to November 2011.  
Eric Bannasch, Cadian Capital's managing member stated, "Cadian Capital is making its nominations due to its significant concerns with the Company's continued underperformance, poorly managed restatement process, and failure to reconstitute the board with independent and qualified directors after shareholders demanded change by forcing two directors to resign last year after they each received more votes cast 'Against' them, than 'For' them."
"This board has failed to listen to the demands of shareholders and has destroyed meaningful shareholder value over the past five years.   Accordingly, we have nominated four director nominees who have the substantive experience that is relevant to the core business of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Verint Systems, Inc., and who will be accountable to all shareholders.  Our director nominees will be the change that is urgently needed to maximize shareholder value."  
The Company has scheduled the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for June 28, 2012.    It is Cadian Capital's understanding that the terms of six directors currently serving on the Board expire at the meeting.  
Cadian Capital is an equity long/short hedge fund manager with a focus on the technology sector. 
CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING PARTICIPANTS

CADIAN CAPITAL STRONGLY ADVISES ALL SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER PROXY MATERIALS AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.  SUCH PROXY MATERIALS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE ON THE SEC'S WEB SITE AT HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.  IN ADDITION, THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PROXY SOLICITATION WILL PROVIDE COPIES OF THE PROXY STATEMENT WITHOUT CHARGE UPON REQUEST.  REQUESTS FOR COPIES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PARTICIPANTS' PROXY SOLICITOR, MORROW & CO., LLC, TOLL-FREE AT (800) 662-5200 or (203) 658-9400.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

 Career History

                                    2008 - Prior                


Cadian Capital Management LP


                  Cadian Capital Management manages funds which seek long-term capital appreciation from investments in equity securities of companies in the global telecommunications, media and technology sectors as well as in consumer, healthcare, industrials, financial services and technology and other related sectors. To implement the funds’ strategy, Cadian focuses on fundamental stock research and selection through a disciplined upside/downside analysis. They take a value-oriented approach to the sectors in which the funds invest, drawing upon the deep sector expertise of its personnel across geographies and asset classes. The firm focuses on minimizing market and other systemic risks to the funds’ portfolios. Cadian seeks conservative net beta exposure through alpha generative long and short positions.Although the funds may hold non-diversified and relatively concentrated portfolios, the primary focus of the funds is to invest in common stocks. Opportunities to enhance capital appreciation are pursued through the use of both long and short positions, margin borrowing, derivatives and other instruments or securities. Depending on market conditions and available investment opportunities, the funds’ portfolios may be concentrated in some or all of the sectors listed above or, alternatively, the funds may focus on investment opportunities in other unrelated sectors. Cadian may also make use of various hedging techniques that might include, but are not limited to, currency hedging, short sales, and the writing of stock options and options on stock market indices (and/or investing directly in these indices).
