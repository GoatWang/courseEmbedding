Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Bitcoin surges as miners avert split for now
              
               Bitcoin continues to rise Saturday after miners back a software upgrade in a move that appears to avert a potential split of the digital currency into multiple versions.

Euro rally has room to run if this pattern continues to hold true
              
              The euro’s continued tear higher marks a renewed correlation with the relative performance of government bonds issued by the eurozone’s most financially stressed countries.
