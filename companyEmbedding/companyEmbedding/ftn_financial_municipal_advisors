FTN Financial Seminar
Memphis, TN
September 17-19, 2017












                            After a lengthy pause, the Fed’s efforts to “normalize” the funds rate got back on track last December.  But major uncertainties remain with respect to the pace of tightening and how market rates along the yield curve will react.  This seminar will focus on strategies to optimize investment portfolio performance as we move through this changing environment. Join us in September as we explore how to manage risk and return through uncertain markets. 
                        





                            here is what prior attendees had to say
                        
"Been coming since at least 1994…and think it’s the best in the country, bar none – and I’ve been to MANY."
"For experienced CFO's I found the seminars useful for managing and strategically planning investment portfolios.  Delving into greater details of the various investment types along with economic trends and forecasts were what I was looking for."
"I think that this is the best seminar that I have attended. The content was very timely…"




Speakers











                                        Archie Manning
                                    





Archie Manning's warm personality, passion for family, class, and character makes him one of the sports world’s most respected personalities. Manning enjoyed an impressive college football career at the University of Mississippi, earning a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame. Drafted with the second overall pick in the 1971 NFL Draft, Manning's storied 14-year career saw him play with the New Orleans Saints, Houston Oilers and Minnesota Vikings. Notable career achievements include two Pro Bowl selections, the 1978 NFC Offensive Player of the Year and the Saints' retiring his jersey. Post-football, Archie has served as a broadcaster, restaurateur, endorser, founder of the Manning Passing Academy and philanthropist. In everything he does, Archie remains grounded and true to his “hard work means everything” mentality. 














                                        Peyton Manning
                                    




  From being the number one overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft through his retirement this past year after helping the Broncos win Super Bowl 50, Peyton Manning scorched the record books and distinguished himself as arguably the best quarterback of his generation. Throughout his 18 NFL seasons, Manning revolutionized the game with his talent and football IQ and made his unmatched leadership and quality of character his trademark.  A future Hall of Fame quarterback, Manning embodies what it means to be a professional athlete in today’s day and age, making a lasting impact both on and off the field. He has championed numerous charitable organizations and foundations to further his positive impact on the community, including the PeyBack Foundation, which he founded in an effort to help underprivileged youth in Colorado, Indiana, Louisiana and Tennessee.  













                                        Cooper Manning
                                    





Mr. Manning is the Senior Managing Director-Investor Relations for AJ Capital Partners, focusing primarily on new business development and managing and curating investor relationships. Prior to joining AJ Capital Partners, he worked in institutional equity sales with Howard Weil in New Orleans, specializing in the oil and gas business. During his 16 years at Howard Weil, Mr. Manning was integral in positing the company as a leader in the energy sector. He was involved in the sale of Howard Weil to Scotia Bank in 2012 and remained on through the transition as a partner. He is also the host of "The Manning Hour" (minus 58 minutes) on Fox Sports. Mr. Manning graduated from the University of Mississippi.

FTN Financial Portfolio Management School





















Portfolio Management School

June 19-21, 2017












                                At FTN Financial, we believe education is the best way to effectively manage your portfolio. That’s why we are bringing you our Portfolio Management School – a program designed to complement our decades of seminars and educational conferences.This year’s Portfolio Management School will guide you through the basics of bonds and portfolio management techniques, looking at a full range of products and analytics needed to help your institution perform. Join us for this informative program, and walk away with a deeper understanding of the bond market.






                                here is what prior attendees had to say
                            
"A typical business school course teaches fundamentals of fixed income securities. Few graduate programs devote a course to addressing practical investment strategies for a depository institution. FTN Financial’s Portfolio Management School fills the training gap for professionals working in the depository industry."
"I am new to purchasing investments and the basic overall approach was a good way for me to learn the bond basics and the book will be a good reference tool."
"In my opinion, the Portfolio Management School was outstanding. The speakers were well prepared and very knowledgeable. The concepts and real life examples provided a clear understanding of the material presented. I enjoyed the presentations and heartily recommend this training for all bankers and bond portfolio managers."

In 2012, buoyed by a desire to make a difference in your community, we created the FTN Financial Capital Markets Public Finance Group, now comprised of 20 professionals who are supported by six underwriting professionals, 11 dedicated municipal salespersons, five traders, and the Municipal Products Manager - each ranging from one to nearly four decades of Municipal bond experience. We are backed by $2.9 billion in capital as a division of First Tennessee Bank, N.A., which we don't hesitate to put behind every underwriting in which we participate. We also leverage our unparalleled depository distribution system to create more competition for the sale of your bonds. In fact, where we bring the most value is our ability to reach bank portfolio and trust department buyers that have traditionally NOT bought tax-exempt general market municipal bonds along with Tier II, III, and IV accounts that are less extensively covered by our competitor firms. From healthcare and school districts to nonprofits, we have the resources in place to bring your issue to the market.
Contact Mike Allen, Municipal Products Manager, for more information.

FTN Financial’s total municipal par underwritten in 2016 was $33.3 billion, an increase of 50% from the previous year. Similarly, our 2015 total municipal par underwritten increased over 160% from 2014. By par amount, we ranked 3rd for bank qualified competitive issues and 10th for all competitive issues, according to Bloomberg.

FTN Financial Chief Economist Chris Low says, “the Fed did the bare minimum,” in its Wednesday statement.

July 26 at 04:00 PM




Even with no large changes anticipated in Wednesday’s statement, “we have to be on guard in case either the Fed does say something, or they say enough to allow a different interpretation from the market,” said Jim Vogel of FTN Financial.

July 26 at 08:15 AM




"If they go ahead and announce the actual date, even if it's October, that would indicate that they must have learned something," said Jim Vogel in regards to the potential date for the central bank to begin unwinding its balance sheet.
