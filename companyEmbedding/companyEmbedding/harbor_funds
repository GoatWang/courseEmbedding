About Expense Ratios:  All mutual funds have expense ratios which represent what shareholders pay for operating expenses and management fees.  Expense ratios are expressed as an annualized percentage of a fund's average net assets paid out in expenses.  Net expense ratios reflect adjustments due to voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements.

About Us



The Harbor Approach

        We appreciate that there are hundreds of fund companies offering thousands of individual funds from which investors can choose. What is different about the Harbor Approach?
        Harbor uses a "manager of managers" approach to investing. Instead of hiring a large team of employees to analyze markets, research investments and build portfolios across many different asset classes, we identify experienced portfolio managers (subadvisers), with proven track records, who specialize in a particular asset class to make all of the day-to-day investment decisions for our funds. For example, we utilize an experienced bond manager like PIMCO to manage our Harbor Bond Fund and another institutional investment manager with experience in managing growth equities, Jennison Associates, to manage our Harbor Capital Appreciation Fund.
Harbor Capital Advisors establishes the objectives and strategies for each fund and closely monitors and evaluates the performance of each fund and its portfolio manager. In this way, investors in Harbor Funds have the benefit of both a professional portfolio manager who selects investments on a day-to day basis for each fund and the benefit of a professional adviser in Harbor Capital Advisors that oversees the work of the portfolio manager.
Using this "manager of managers" approach, we believe Harbor can offer important benefits to our shareholders, including:

The right manager for the right fund. The investment philosophy and strategy that works for one fund, or one type of investment, won't necessarily work for another. By employing independent subadvisers to make the day-to-day investment decisions for our funds, we believe shareholders benefit from the expertise of a portfolio manager that specializes in a particular investment style or asset class. These subadvisers aren't tied to a single perspective on the markets that may be out of favor and affect all funds. 
"Institutional-quality" funds for all investors. Most of our subadvisers work almost exclusively with large, sophisticated institutional investors such as corporate and public pension plans. Their investment services are not always available for most individual investors. Harbor has taken that institutional-level expertise, however, and made it available as a family of mutual funds for institutional and individual investors. 
Truly objective fund management. Each of our subadvisers is independent of Harbor. This professional relationship with our subadvisers allows us to be unbiased and objective when evaluating their adherence to the funds' stated investment strategies and the value they provide to shareholders. Our subadvisers are trusted business partners, not co-workers. 
Modest costs. Our arrangements with subadvisers, combined with our internal philosophy of closely managing costs, allow us to offer a family of funds that we believe delivers long-term value to our shareholders.

        The acquired fund fees and expenses ("AFFE") are the expenses indirectly incurred by the Fund as a result of its investments during the most recent fiscal year in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles. Because these costs are indirect, the total annual fund operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio shown in the Fund's financial highlights table because that ratio does not include the AFFE.

Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the past performance data shown. Investment returns and the value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You can obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end (available within seven business days after the most recent month-end) by calling 800-422-1050 or visiting www.harborfunds.com.


The Harbor Funds performance shown assumes the reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions and is net of management fees and expenses.  Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.


        From time to time, certain fees and/or expenses have been voluntarily or contractually waived or reimbursed, which has resulted in higher returns. Without these waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower. Voluntary waivers or reimbursements may be applied or discontinued at any time without notice. Only the Board of Trustees may modify or terminate contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements.
    

The Harbor Target Retirement Income Fund is designed for investors currently in retirement, and its investments are expected to remain stable over time.  The other Harbor Target Retirement Funds are designed for investors who plan to retire close to the year indicated in the Funds' names.  These Funds' asset allocations will change over time and become more conservative as time elapses.
The principal value of the Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including the target retirement date.

Investment returns and the value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You can obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end (available within seven business days after the most recent month-end) by calling 800-422-1050 or visiting www.harborfunds.com.



        The current yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Harbor Money Market Fund than the total return.
    

The Harbor Funds performance shown assumes the reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions and is net of management fees and expenses.  Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.


        From time to time, certain fees and/or expenses have been voluntarily or contractually waived or reimbursed, which has resulted in higher returns. Without these waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower. Voluntary waivers or reimbursements may be applied or discontinued at any time without notice. Only the Board of Trustees may modify or terminate contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements.
    


You could lose money by investing in the Harbor Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund and you should not expect the sponsor to provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
    

The Harbor Target Retirement Income Fund is designed for investors currently in retirement, and its investments are expected to remain stable over time.  The other Harbor Target Retirement Funds are designed for investors who plan to retire close to the year indicated in the Funds' names.  These Funds' asset allocations will change over time and become more conservative as time elapses.
The principal value of the Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including the target retirement date.


        The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

        The acquired fund fees and expenses ("AFFE") are the expenses indirectly incurred by the Fund as a result of its investments during the most recent fiscal year in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles. Because these costs are indirect, the total annual fund operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio shown in the Fund's financial highlights table because that ratio does not include the AFFE.
    


        The Adviser has contractually agreed to limit the Fund's operating expenses, excluding interest expense (if any) and the AFFE, to 0.70%, 0.95%, 1.07% and 0.62% for the Institutional Class, Administrative Class, Investor Class and Retirement Class, respectively, through February 28, 2019.

Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the past performance data shown. Investment returns and the value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. You can obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end (available within seven business days after the most recent month-end) by calling 800-422-1050 or visiting www.harborfunds.com.



        The current yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Harbor Money Market Fund than the total return.
    

The Harbor Funds performance shown assumes the reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions and is net of management fees and expenses.  Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.


        From time to time, certain fees and/or expenses have been voluntarily or contractually waived or reimbursed, which has resulted in higher returns. Without these waivers or reimbursements, the returns would have been lower. Voluntary waivers or reimbursements may be applied or discontinued at any time without notice. Only the Board of Trustees may modify or terminate contractual fee waivers or expense reimbursements.
    


You could lose money by investing in the Harbor Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund and you should not expect the sponsor to provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
    

The Harbor Target Retirement Income Fund is designed for investors currently in retirement, and its investments are expected to remain stable over time.  The other Harbor Target Retirement Funds are designed for investors who plan to retire close to the year indicated in the Funds' names.  These Funds' asset allocations will change over time and become more conservative as time elapses.
The principal value of the Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including the target retirement date.


        The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

        The acquired fund fees and expenses ("AFFE") are the expenses indirectly incurred by the Fund as a result of its investments during the most recent fiscal year in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
