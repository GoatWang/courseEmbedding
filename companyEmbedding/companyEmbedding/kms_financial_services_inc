 Download as PDF

August 11, 2014


Leading Seattle-Based Independent Broker-Dealer Will Strengthen
      Ladenburg’s Position in Pacific Northwest


Transaction to Add Over $14 Billion in Client Assets and
      Approximately 325 Independent Financial Advisors and $84 Million in
      Revenue


Ladenburg Will Have Approximately $110 Billion in Client Assets,
      3,500 Independent Financial Advisors and $1 Billion of Annual Revenues
      Upon Closing of Pending Acquisitions

    MIAMI--
      Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE MKT:LTS, LTS PrA)
      (“Ladenburg”), a publicly-traded diversified financial services company,
      announced today it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire KMS
      Financial Services, Inc. (“KMS”), a leading Seattle-based independent
      broker-dealer and investment advisor with a strong presence in the
      Pacific Northwest.
    

      Under the terms of the transaction, Ladenburg will pay approximately $24
      million, consisting of $11 million of cash, $8 million of four-year
      notes and 1,440,922 shares of Ladenburg common stock. This transaction
      is part of Ladenburg’s ongoing strategy to strengthen its position as an
      industry-leading network of independent brokerage and advisory firms and
      its market share in the industry.
    

      Founded in 1971, KMS has approximately 325 independent financial
      advisors with over $14 billion in client assets and revenues of
      approximately $84 million for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. Upon
      completion of the transaction, Mark Hamby, KMS’s Chairman and CEO, Eric
      Westberg, its President and COO, and the rest of the KMS management team
      will continue to operate KMS as a stand-alone business based in its
      current headquarters in Seattle, Washington.
    

      With the KMS acquisition and Ladenburg’s recently-announced, pending
      acquisition of assets of Sunset Financial Services, Inc., Ladenburg’s
      network of independent brokerage and advisory firms will total
      approximately 3,500 financial advisors with $110 billion in total client
      assets and Ladenburg will have annual revenues of approximately $1
      billion. The KMS transaction will give Ladenburg a significantly
      expanded presence in the Pacific Northwest.
    

      “This transaction shows Ladenburg’s commitment to the proposition that
      the independent brokerage and advisory business is one of the most
      dynamic areas of the financial services industry,” said Dr. Phillip
      Frost, Ladenburg’s Chairman of the Board and principal shareholder. “We
      value the unique culture of KMS and believe that they will be a natural
      fit for the businesses we are building at Ladenburg.”
    

      “KMS has been owned and operated by its key managers for more than 40
      years, and has established itself as a client focused firm committed to
      helping mainstream investors reach their financial goals,” said Richard
      Lampen, Ladenburg’s President and CEO. “As a part of the Ladenburg
      family, KMS will retain its distinct brand while gaining the advantages
      of access to the differentiated products and services offered to our
      independent advisors, enabling them to meet evolving client needs, stay
      competitive and further grow their business.”
    

      “We have been impressed by Ladenburg’s record of acquiring independent
      brokerage and advisory firms with distinct cultures and helping them
      pool their collective strengths to capitalize on growth opportunities,”
      said Mr. Hamby. “Joining Ladenburg’s alliance of firms points to a
      dynamic future for the culture we’ve developed over KMS’s first 43
      years.”
    

      KMS will leverage the financial benefits and strength that Ladenburg
      possesses as an established public company. In addition, KMS advisors
      will have access to the differentiated products and services that
      Ladenburg brings to the independent channel, including: access to
      investment banking and capital markets resources, institutional quality
      equity research, a fixed-income trading desk, wealth management services
      through Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, specialized point-of-sale
      support for life insurance products through Highland Capital Brokerage,
      and advisor-friendly trust services through Premier Trust.
    

      Ladenburg acquired its first independent broker-dealer firm in 2007 and
      its subsidiaries today include Securities America, Triad Advisors and
      Investacorp. Like these firms, KMS will retain its special culture and
      management team, while benefitting from the wide array of investment
      products, services, technology and practice management support that
      define Ladenburg’s commitment to the independent broker-dealer and
      advisory space.
    

      Ladenburg’s acquisition of KMS is expected to close later this year, and
      is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing
      conditions. Approval by Ladenburg’s shareholders is not required.
      Graubard Miller served as legal counsel for Ladenburg in the
      transaction, and Aery Advisors served as counsel for KMS.
