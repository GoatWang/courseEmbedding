Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2016 CoreLogic, Inc. earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call may be recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Dan Smith, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Dan L. Smith - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our investor presentation and conference call, where we present our financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Speaking today will be CoreLogic's President and CEO, Anand Nallathambi; CFO, Jim Balas; and COO, Frank Martell.
Before we begin, let me make a few important points. First, we posted our slide presentation, which includes additional details on our financial results on our website. Second, please note that during today's presentation, we may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including statements concerning our expected business and operational plans, performance outlook and acquisition and growth strategies and our expectations regarding industry conditions.
All of these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. For further looking details concerning these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs. Our forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us, and we do not intend to undertake – and we undertake no duty to update these statements for any reason.

Finally, please limit yourselves to one question with a brief follow-up. We'll take additional questions at the end of the call, as time permits.
Thanks. And now, let me introduce our President and CEO, Anand Nallathambi.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to CoreLogic's second quarter earnings call. I will lead off today with an update on important market trends and areas of strategic focus. Jim will review financial results for the quarter, and Frank will cover operational highlights and provide color on our financial guidance and capital return.
CoreLogic is off to a great start in 2016 with strong growth in revenues, operating profits, cash flow and adjusted EPS. Revenues for the second quarter were up 30%, operating income was up 24%, adjusted EBITDA was up 15% and adjusted EPS was up 18%. For the first half, revenues were 27% above last year and operating income was up 21%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS rose 11% and 12%, respectively.

In terms of strategic imperatives, a major focus area over the last nine months has been the scaling of our property Valuation Solutions Group. Since the launch of the VSG in September of 2015, we have acquired a significant set of data, technology, analytics and services-related assets focused on property appraisal. These assets build upon and complement a number of valuation-related data and analytics services offered by CoreLogic before the launch of the VSG.
Most recently, we completed the acquisition of FNC in late April. This is a foundational platform asset for VSG. In addition, during the second quarter, we assembled a core leadership team for VSG and completed a series of planning and feedback sessions with key constituents in the valuation space. These sessions will help us develop a comprehensive set of property valuation and collateral assessment solutions that connect market participants with supply chain service providers.
The market for residential property valuation in the U.S. is about $4 billion annually. Based on our discussions with lenders, regulators and service providers, we believe that the area would benefit from operational scale, enhanced technology and the application of data and analytics. The opportunity to transform the way real estate assets are valued and to bring greater transparency to the underwriting process makes this a significant medium and long-term growth opportunity for us.
During the second quarter, we delivered strong growth in our insurance, geospatial and international operations. Over the past five years, we have increased revenues contributed by these units almost threefold. We expect these businesses to contribute about 15% of our total revenue in 2016, up from 8% five years ago.
Expanding our footprint and building market leadership in valuation insurance, geospatial and international has been a major success and will continue to be a strategic focus area. These businesses are highly synergistic with our core Property Intelligence assets and are a significant growth opportunity for us.
Over the last six months, we continued to scale back certain non-core product lines, tightened discretionary and project-related spending. From a market perspective, much of this discretionary spending has been redirected by industry participants to cope with the challenging regulatory environment, including the need to invest in such areas as compliance management, information security and vendor oversight.
We are entering the balance of 2016 with a clear pathway to accelerating growth, actually deploying new and unique data-driven solutions that enable participants in the real estate ecosystem to more precisely underwrite and manage their risks and capitalize on opportunities.
As I have mentioned on past earnings calls, the U.S. mortgage market is continuing to transition to a purchase-driven cycle. We believe the transition will continue, fueled by expected increases in population, the first-time home buyers and plus fewer cash purchases.
We have recently experienced a rise in refinancing activity, spurred by the reaction to Brexit and historically low interest rates. However, based on current mortgage industry predictions, we do not expect this elevated level of activity to continue through the rest of 2016. Based on our research, we now believe the ongoing growth in home purchase activity and the return to normalized levels of refinancing support a new normal mortgage market of $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion going forward.
We have a long established track record of consistently outperforming market volume trends. This strong performance has resulted from our focus on scaling our core business units through market share gains, product development as well as smart acquisitions.

In closing, I want to thank our employees, clients and shareholders for their continued support. We delivered a strong first half in 2016. I believe our performance demonstrates the value creation opportunities inherent in our strategic plan. Our focus remains squarely on strong operational execution and positioning CoreLogic for superior long-term growth and stakeholder value creation.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Balas for an update on our financial results. Jim has been a key contributor to CoreLogic since 2011, and we're very proud to have him serve as our Chief Financial Officer. Frank and I look forward to working with Jim to take CoreLogic to even greater heights. Jim?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Thank you, Anand, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our second quarter financial results and provide some additional color on our recent bond redemption and the upsizing of our credit facility.
As Anand mentioned, second quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and adjusted EPS were up strongly from 2015. As we have over the past several years, we outpaced the U.S. mortgage market volumes, benefiting from the market leadership of our core Property Intelligence and underwriting in risk management solution areas.
Notable second quarter financial highlights included, first, we grew revenues 30%. This was boosted by the launch of the VSG and underlying growth of 3% from core product lines. Positive organic growth was achieved despite reduced levels of discretionary spending by clients in the mortgage industry.
Next, we increased operating income by 24% and adjusted EBITDA by 15% while continuing to make important investments in growth, productivity, compliance and technology. Third, aggressive execution against our cost productivity and efficiency targets help drive up profits and self-fund reinvestment. During the quarter, we focused on simplifying our organization structure, improving operational processes and reducing SG&A cost levels.
Fourth, on a trailing-12-month basis, we converted 65% of our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow. Free cash flow conversion rates remain strong, as we enhance our business mix and manage working capital.
And finally, during July, we upsized our term loan facility and redeemed our outstanding senior notes due in 2021. This should provide lower cost funding and additional flexibility going forward.
Now, I will cover the financial results in more detail. Second quarter revenues totaled $500 million compared with $386 million in 2015. The 30% increase was driven primarily by the PI segment. PI segment revenues rose 72% to $277 million, driven principally by the VSG and growth in insurance and spatial solutions in international.
RMW segment revenues were in line with 2015 levels, as market share and pricing gains offset reduced project-related revenues and the wind-down of certain non-core product lines.
Operating income from continuing operations was up 24% to $76 million for the quarter. Benefits from revenue gains and productivity more than offset costs associated with the VSG launch, optimization of the capital structure, integration, severance and investments in cyber security and compliance. Operating margin was 15% after absorbing these costs and investments. Second quarter margins were mostly in line with 2015 levels.
Second quarter net income and diluted EPS from continuing operations totaled $40 million and $0.45, compared with $33 million and $0.36, respectively, in 2015. Growth in net income and diluted EPS reflects the operating upsides previously discussed and the positive impact of share repurchases, which more than offset higher taxes in the quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS was up 18% to $0.65 for the quarter, reflecting the positive impacts of growth, cost reduction and share repurchases. Adjusted EBITDA was up 15% to $136 million in the second quarter, largely due to revenue growth and the benefits of cost productivity programs.

Finally, free cash flow continued to be very strong in the second quarter. On a trailing-12-month basis, as of June 30, 2016, free cash flow totaled $290 million, a 65% conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA.
The balance of my prepared remarks today will focus on our capital structure optimization. As recently announced, on July 18 we paid $411 million to complete the redemption of all of our outstanding senior notes due in 2021. We funded this redemption through a $525 million expansion, an amendment of our existing credit facility. After upsizing our term loan and redeeming our senior notes, CoreLogic had total debt of $1.6 billion, consisting of $1.3 billion in outstanding term loans and $280 million drawn against the $550 million revolving credit facility.
Our updated capital structure provides CoreLogic with substantial additional financial flexibility and significantly lowers interest expense. As we have discussed in the past, CoreLogic's strong operating results, free cash flow and balanced capital management approach allow the company to invest in our strategic programs and also to return capital to shareholders as we maintain prudent debt levels.
We had a strong second quarter and first half, and I look forward to a successful second half of 2016. Thank you for your support, and I will now turn the call over to Frank.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Jim.
Today, I'm going to outline the progress we are making, capitalizing on our growth opportunities and expanding margins. I will also provide some thoughts on the increase in our 2016 financial guidance and capital return targets.
As Jim and Anand highlighted, we had a strong second quarter and first half. Importantly, we continue to execute against our strategic imperatives, which are focused on delivering unique property insights that allow participants in the real estate ecosystem to make better decisions in the areas of prospect identification, underwriting, and continuous risk management and monitoring. Our consistent focus on driving scale and operating leverage, cost productivity and cash flow allows us to reinvest in leading-edge product development, technology initiatives and risk management programs. This helps us to sustain our competitive advantage and broaden our capabilities.
CoreLogic's first half revenues were up 27%, driven by the scaling of our property Valuation Solutions Group. We think there is a unique opportunity to transform the property valuation experience in the U.S., and we believe we are well-positioned to do so, given our scale and data-driven insights.
Regarding the VSG, we expect to exit this year with a well-integrated appraisal operation that consistently delivers to the highest service levels. We also expect to see the initial benefits of data and operational synergies between the acquired VSG assets and other CoreLogic operations. Completing the integration of our capabilities and realizing the full potential of VSG will be a significant multi-year endeavor.
In addition to VSG-related growth drivers, we also launched a number of new products and enhancements over the past 12 to 18 months. A number of these should become industry-standard tools over time, and several are progressively gaining traction in the marketplace. In the case of our insurance unit, new products are helping to drive accelerated growth rates.
Our focus on pricing is also yielding benefits. And, finally, we are seeing upsides from cross-selling-related point solutions through more integrated offerings and packages. As we scale and drive top line growth, we're also relentlessly pursuing first-quartile levels of cost efficiency. We are committed to achieving 30%-plus adjusted EBITDA margins, based on a normalized U.S. mortgage market and after accounting for the build-out of our Valuation Solutions platform.

We believe we can achieve our margin goals through the combination of profitable growth, favorable shifts in revenue mix, as well as business model transformation and cost productivity. Regarding cost management, we expect to save at least $30 million this year by consolidating facilities, reducing SG&A costs, outsourcing certain business activities and other operational improvements.
These programs should also contribute an additional $15 million in savings in 2017. Actual second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, a bit ahead of our expectations, driven by upside in the PI segment. The launch of the VSG had a roughly 500 basis point impact on total company adjusted second quarter EBITDA margins.
Our 2016 year-to-date financial results provide an indication of the effectiveness of our laser-like focus on delivering our business plan. We have a strong management team dedicated to delivering consistent stakeholder value. Over the past five years, our strategic growth and operational excellence programs have produced double-digit compound growth rates for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. At the same time, the price of our common shares has risen more than threefold.
I will close my prepared remarks today with a brief discussion around our increased 2016 financial guidance and share repurchase targets. We are increasing our 2016 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges based on our strong first half performance and higher than initially expected 2016 U.S. mortgage unit volumes.
We now expect to generate revenue of $1.89 billion to $1.92 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $480 million to $500 million and adjusted EPS at $2.20 to $2.30 per share. The midpoints of these ranges generate annual growth rates of 25%, 16% and 19% for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, respectively.
Our increased guidance reflects the following: First, our latest view of 2016 U.S. mortgage origination volumes; second, the impact of the delayed closing of FNC; third, lower interest expenses; and, fourth, the positive impact of higher share repurchases.
In terms of the third quarter of 2016, based on seasonality and our current view of origination unit volume trends and timing of our investment to cost management programs, we believe that adjusted EBITDA should be in line with or modestly above second quarter 2016 levels.
Finally, we have increased our share buyback program to 3 million shares this year. This increase is consistent with our long-held practice of rewarding our shareholders through a significant level of annual capital return. This is made possible by strong revenue and profit growth and our high cash flow conversion. So far, this year, we've repurchased 800,000 shares. We have and will continue to repurchase shares using cash generated from operations.
We also plan to make voluntary debt repayments. Lower debt levels and growth and profitability should result in debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios approaching 3 times by year end. Although our market capitalization has increased significantly over the past several years, we believe that our current share place does not reflect the full intrinsic value of our business today and its future potential. Therefore, in our view, the ongoing repurchase of substantial numbers of our common shares remains a significant source of potential value creation for our shareholders.
In closing, CoreLogic continues to deliver strategically, operationally and financially. Over the long term, we remain committed to delivering consistently superior value creation through the realization of our vision of providing unique property level insights to the global real estate ecosystem.
Thank you, all, for your time today. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning, everyone.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Good morning, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And congratulations to Jim on the promotion.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Thanks, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, first question, I just wanted to ask about your forecast for the $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion for 2017. The MBA is forecasting a $1.38 trillion market. Where does your forecast differ with the MBA forecast and what gives you confidence in it?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Bill, this is Frank. Just to clarify, on the quotation, $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion is a new normal level. It doesn't refer specifically to 2017. We haven't provided a viewpoint on 2017 origination volumes.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
As you may remember, based on the environmental factors in the mortgage market on, call it, kind of a $1.5 trillion market is a normal – kind of new normal post-recession. And I think, based on what's been happening, that's actually a little bit more favorable at the $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Sure. I mean, right now, you're trending at about $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion for the year. So, I mean, that would seem – it would seem potentially like a reasonable expectation for next year. But anyway, what are you seeing in the – from your vantage point, that's giving you confidence in that level?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
For the last couple of years of being in that area and I think, assuming 2016 is going to be flat as 2015, because that's what most of the industry predictions are, it's right about that number, Bill. So, unless something drastically changes, we think that that's a pretty good new normal with some yearly fluctuations based on market conditions.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. And then, for my second question, on your unit volumes, it looked like flood was up about 4%, tax up about 11% and credit was particularly strong at 17%. Just wanted to ask about what was driving the different volumes there.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think, obviously, they are slightly different markets and we have different shares. The credit number is a little bit higher due to – we've had actually some pretty good success in the big mass market on taking some volume and taking some market share, Bill, in the last couple of years. So, that's been – that accounts for the slight differential there. And then, we've had some different share gains and different client adds, so that accounts slightly. In any given quarter, the rates may vary a little bit.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Bill, also, the normal seasonality is such that credit comes really first. And as they look to write apps, and flood and tax come a lot later, tax being the last one as they (25:06) so you could have normal seasonality.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. Well, thank you very much.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, guys. I just want to start off, trying to get a bigger picture understanding of growth trends. From your perspective, when we look at the organic rate of the business being, I guess, around flat when you back out the deals or maybe 1% constant currency and then I guess we get to around 3% when we add back the non-core project-related revenue that I think you guys have tried to talk about before that you consider sort of discontinued. I guess just we're in a relatively flat market now, at least, from a number of loan standpoint. And so, can you help us bridge what would get us from what is around, let's call it, a 3%-ish organic growth rate to the mid- to high-single digit growth that you talked about longer term being able to do?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Bill, this is Frank. I think we've discussed a couple of things on the call. And I think there are – the good news is there are a number of levers that we think are going to help us there. One, I talked about pricing, so we've invested in some additional resources to help us accelerate the rate of price increases. Certainly coming through the recession and out of the recession, essentially, we weren't getting any price. So, we think we can get a couple of percentage points of growth as a base for accelerated organic growth rates.
Secondly, I think the product introductions that I mentioned over the last couple of years, we've really just fired up that engine of growth for us. And I think that we're starting to see some clear traction there. I think we had the best year, the best quarter, growth-wise in the insurance area in a great long period of time. And that's really driven to a fair degree by the product launches that we've made over the last 18 months.
So, I think that's a good validation that we can have success in the market with the new products. And we have a variety of those, both in the core mortgage area, but also in the insurance international areas as well in the geospatial areas, some new models, et cetera. So, I think the second area beyond pricing is our product introduction area.
The third area, I think as Anand kind of alluded to, the time period of the last certainly several quarters, and I think this is an area that I think everybody's kind of under estimated the impact of the burden of the regulatory environment. And the fact of the matter is that a lot of the lenders, in particular, the servicers and other participants in the market, are really struggling to keep up and to manage the regulatory burdens, which are expanding. And I think whereas we used to get a fair amount of discretionary spending, that's somewhat dried up.
And the final area is, I think, obviously, we talked about this on past calls. The fourth area that gives us good solid support for an accelerated growth rate is the fact that these non-core areas, we had five or six areas that were just – collectively, they were a meaningful number – amount of revenue. But individually, they're somewhat small. But they're little areas of non-core that we're just biting the bullet and getting through. So, this year, we're bearing the brunt of that now, and that will dissipate as we go forward, obviously, so there's four areas – there are others, but those are four principal areas that give us pretty good foundation for our expectation of an accelerated growth rate.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And is VSG a part of that also, I mean, as sort of the new products? Just I imagine expanding the opportunity there as you've finally gotten through, really, the – you're going through the integration now and everything, the deals. I imagine – I mean, that's definitely predicating a lot of basis for investors.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think, as Anand mentioned, one of the things that we feel about VSG is there's tremendous data content resident in those assets that we can leverage. So, we see a great deal of synergy beyond just – obviously, it's a huge market space that's really fragmented. So, I think that that's an area of tremendous organic growth and inorganic growth as well. It's a huge – at $4 billion, the U.S. – and that's just the U.S. That's not international. We have a very large footprint in valuation in Australia as well. So, to that extent, we're a global leader in valuation. We'd like to take that to other geographies.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Just for my follow-up, the guidance reason it was predicated on roughly flat number of loans year-over-year versus a prior expectation, I think, for a decline of around 15% or I guess it's an improvement now of around a couple of hundred billion dollars from your prior expectation volume. Historically, I know you suggested around $15 million of incremental EBITDA for every $100 billion or so. So, just touching on the raise in guidance of $15 million in EBITDA, I mean, is it – instead of what would be around $30 million, I mean, is it related to integration investments or just conservatism in the outlook or anything else we should think of? Thanks, guys.

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. So, I think, obviously, a part of that is looking at unit volumes versus dollars. So, there's...
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah...
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
A little bit of – yeah, there's definitely price inflation there. I think we're pretty well in line with our historical sensitivity levels. We did have a month' delay in FNC that cost us a little bit. So, there are some swings and roundabouts there. But I think, if you factor that in, factor our view of the strengthening dollar versus the – some of the foreign currencies, you know that story. So, there's a few of those swings and roundabouts that take away a little bit.
But I think the strong raise in guidance – obviously, I think, as we mentioned in the last call, we're still looking at – we have a fair amount of revenue coming through VSG that's concentrated in a couple of clients. So, reflecting the mortgage market changes, our sensitivity will be changing a little bit. We'll provide a little bit of an update on that toward the end of this year.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And have you – just the last question. I'm getting these from two clients as we speak and I'll be turning back to the queue. Have you provided any – or can you provide any opportunity of discussion around the opportunity for VSG's growth rate? Or is that just still too early to say? In terms of what it can do over the next two to three years even?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
We're in a – because we see it's a massive market opportunity, so I think it can be very high. We haven't provided specific percentages. But certainly, it's likely to be of an aggressive growth rate.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Great. All right. Guys, thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Close enough, thanks. Can you give us a sense of the non-core products? I think you said there's five to six areas that are getting bucketed in here. Just roughly, what is the current-year revenue contribution from those? And then, are there other products that you're flagging that maybe will be considered noncore a year or two from now and are kind of undergoing devaluation? Just trying to understand how much exposure we still have to this headwind.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah. In terms of the non-core products, on a year-to-year basis, the impact to the quarter is probably about $10 million collectively.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Right. But I guess what I'm wondering is do you still have $50 million of net exposure? Or just how far away are we working through those?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Probably exiting this year and a little bit into next year, so I think it's going to be over the next 12 months. It is five to six. Some of the product lines have tails to them.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
But, Jeff, the vast majority is coming through the system now. So, as Jim mentioned, it will dissipate through the balance of this year. So, it's – going forward, it will be a materially lower factor. And it's mostly – this is mostly – we had a document retrieval business and some staff augmentation and a few other areas that were legacy from the default area – default services area, so these are kind of bits and oddball units.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah. The H1 impact is probably bigger than what we'll see in the back half of the year.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then, on the new product introduction, is there any way to roughly quantify the number of meaningful new products you're launching per year now relative to what it was, I don't know, three years ago or something like that? And then, on insurance, I think this is the first time at least I remember you talking about new product development specific to insurance. Can you give us an example of a meaningful new product there?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. So, we have – in terms of the numbers of new products, I'd say that we're now on a cadence of three to five material launches a year, which for a company our size I think is probably appropriate. It could vary from year to year, but that's – I think, as it relates to insurance, we have different products that have been launched around different weather forensic models, for example, and different post-event surveillance.
So, obviously, when you have a weather event and it impacts properties, we have a rapid response and surveillance product that's been launched. So, there's a number of other ones as well. But as we – when we originally expanded our insurance footprint, we talked about accelerating the growth rates from kind of a low-single digits, and I think this is starting to – we're starting to realize that objective, which I think is, again, a good validation of the integration of accelerated growth opportunities in some of these areas. And we think VSG kind of fits the same type of bill. Obviously, it's a much, much bigger market space, so the growth rates can be higher. But we're quite pleased with the insurance – the acceleration in insurance growth.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Campbell of Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.
John Campbell - Stephens, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.
John Campbell - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Just first on the guidance around margins, I think, in the first half, you guys – I think incremental margin was about 11%. Guidance looks like it's about 25% on the back half. Just trying to get a better grip on that ramp in the leverage just throughout the year. I mean, is that just largely from the tapering VSG integration spend?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
It's a couple of factors. Expenses should trend down in the back half of the year, so that's number one. And number two is, obviously, we've got FNC, which is a higher margin area for more of the second quarter than first quarter. And then we have basically our cost management program benefits as well, kind of progressed. So, those are kind of the three areas.
John Campbell - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I think you guys might have originally called out maybe $10 million to $12 million in VSG integration costs. Have we largely seen all of that in the first half of the year?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
No, it runs through – it still runs through the balance of the year. It comes down in the fourth quarter, assuming everything goes to plan, and so far so good. So, we still have – there are still integration-related costs. Obviously, it's a significant undertaking, we're dealing with our major partners there, so we have to also manage to their needs as well. So – but everything is going really well.
John Campbell - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, the restructuring of the debt, it looks like you guys have increased the flexibility a little bit. Just curious about M&A pipeline or maybe what the appetite for M&A is from here.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think, we were – as Anand kind of mentioned, we're focused on doing smart deals, so nothing major necessarily on the horizon at this point in time. We're pretty busy right now integrating what we have. But certainly Jim has done a great job of expanding our powder, and I think we have a tremendous capital structure now. So, if something really synergistic or valuable appears, we might be able to capitalize on it. But, as of now, we're kind of in the integration mode.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. If we look at anything, it'll be probably product extensions and stuff. I don't think we are – at this point, at least, I don't want to say never or no to anything, but we don't have anything that's significant in our pipeline but just around that product offerings or project extensions.
John Campbell - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for taking our questions, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Dunn of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. A couple of number questions to start. Can you detail the incremental expense saves, the business reinvestment and the integration expenses in the PI segment this quarter just to see what the moving parts are?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that, Geoff?
Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Just to break down, I think you called out $15 million of total extraneous costs this quarter. Can you break down the business reinvestments versus the integration expense and then also the incremental efficiency gains?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
In terms of the saves themselves, we included the $30 million as part of the full year. We're progressing against that. And the way I would look at it amongst the segments, it's pretty equally distributed between the two segments in corporate. And in terms of the investments, those are, kind of, coming along as planned.
Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Yeah. I'm actually looking for the numbers, if you have them. Was it $4 million of reinvestment this quarter and $6 million of integration costs? How does it break down? How does that $15 million break down?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think you can work with Dan on the details. I think in terms of roughly just some of those, as we kind of articulated in the earnings release, relate to areas like compliance and information security that apply broadly across the company. I'd say the biggest chunk that would be specific would be the VSG related, which is obviously all, probably 40% of the total, would be related to that.
Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. I'll follow up with Dan. The other question I had is on the purchase market. I'm curious. It seems like maybe purchase, when you strip out HPA, is lagging some of the projections that we started off the year. What's your sense of the purchase market health going through year-end and into next year? Refi volatility is going to continue, but I'm curious as to your thoughts on the health of the overall purchase market.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
I think the purchase market is starting to civilize to some extent. There is going to be always puts and takes. The refi activity, that's going to be determined by rates and we don't think – well, there's a lot of people are saying that fed is not going to touch the rates, but there is also thinking that fed could make a rate change at the end of the year. So, refis are going to be dependent upon that. But we see a solid footing on purchase that's going to only increase with new homes coming in and also single family renters moving into homes.
Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Are you worried at all with the affordability if rates do start to go up a bit?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
I don't necessarily worry about it. I think with the current criteria, it's pretty tight. So, if there is anything, I don't think it's a question of affordability. It's probably going to be a question of how credit capacity is being viewed by the lenders and regulators. So, that still has to settle down.

Geoffrey Murray Dunn - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks, Anand.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bose George of KBW. Your line is open.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. This is actually Chas Tyson on for Bose. I just want to ask about VSG and the timing there. I know you mentioned that you've assembled the leadership team and done some feedback meetings. But maybe, if you could give some more color about the timing of introducing the enhanced technology and data to the former RELS and LandSafe businesses. And then, potentially maybe think about kind of inorganic growth and expanding your market share significantly.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Chas, this is Frank. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so I think we've made tremendous progress at VSG. We're really happy about assembling a great team. And I think we've got a really, really strong team, which is I think unusual to assemble that so quickly. So, we feel that's pretty good and will give us a leg up in terms of how quickly we can do things.
This year, it's very important that we integrate our appraisal operations. We think we have the best service level in the industry today with both RELS and the LandSafe businesses. We want to be able to combine them and keep that level of service or expand it. So, that can be the biggest focus this year is to make sure that happens so we come out next year and that's where essentially the gates open in terms of organic growth for those two firms.
We have the biggest staff appraiser panel in the U.S., which is a tremendous competitive advantage, so we think that that from an inorganic perspective there's tremendous growth there. We want to make sure that we're targeted in how we do that. Obviously, there's margin implications, etc. So, we want to make sure that we're careful. But that is a tremendous opportunity for us if we get that right this year and we feel pretty good about that.
I think, in terms of the synergies, we provide – the exciting thing to me is we provide tremendous gradations of property valuation services, anything from an AVM up to a full property inspection and many points in between so those give our clients a wide array of different solution sets that they can apply to different types of activities within their shop and we can do that under one roof. So, we think that that's a 2017-type activity. We're working on the IT side there to be able to enable that delivery, so that's more of a 2017, but it's very exciting.
And the third thing is we operate, if not the most important, one of the most important valuation industry consortiums, working a lot to expand and build on that very important source of insight for our clients, the consortium and that's where companies like FNC come in and provide tremendous additional data that can be put through those types of vehicles, so those I think will come forward into promise in 2017, but for now, really focus on the integration of the appraisal companies, assembly of the management team, and really (45:24) talked about getting the industry constituents – some consensus with the industry constituents in terms of where to focus and what the biggest pain points are, et cetera.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, on FNC, I know you had said that there were differences in the client list between what FNC was surveying and what CoreLogic had been surveying. I mean, is that a process that you started of shopping that around to clients? And can you talk about how conversations are going there and what we should think of from maybe a growth trend on that particular revenue stream?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Well, FNC has over a hundred lender clients and those tend to be – there's some large clients, but they tend to be more clustered in the mid and what we call the mid mass markets. That's an area that we've invested behind the last maybe three to four years to build out our footprint. And so, it's very symbiotic from that standpoint. I think where the opportunity lies for us is some of the mid mass market clients that may or may not use some of our other data sets like flood or credit, we think we can package through the FNC platform more of our content and that will be again kind of a 17-type because requires some technology and some distribution enablement.

Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, just one last one, if I could squeeze it in. I think you guys passed on March 31 one of the last DataQuick unlocks for customers there to switch off. Did you guys see any significant customer attrition from that? And has that been a factor in property information growth over the last couple years?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
No. I think that was just a – I think you're referring to the FTC consenting rate towards helping realty track. And that seems going according to plan. And I don't think we have had any significant impacts from that. It's a very minor part of our focus in the market.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay.

Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Gamaitoni of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. On the $4 billion in annual revenue you mentioned in the appraisal industry, is all of that open to you, given your current product set? And what market share do you currently have?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
It's by product. What we talked about was the total addressable market. That's the $4 billion out there. But we don't certainly cover everything. But when it comes to AVMs, we have a pretty large share out there with our own product and also with white label products and private label products out there. So, there is still opportunity and hard to go about it. The front end of the appraisal market is a wide open market. That's where everybody – even you can have solutions that control the appraiser's desktop and help them to funnel information into an entity like FNC to go into the lenders.
So, there are pockets in areas of growth where we could really address. It's tough to kind of put a market share out there. We are trying to kind of figure out all these things. And I think once the integration for VSG is done, we'll have a better feel for what are the big pieces of the market that recover where we want and what we consider to be longer term market share opportunities for us.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then, on – just to clarify, on the underlying growth rate of 3% for core products, is that constant currency or including FX headwinds that you previously stated?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
That's excluding FX.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
So, that's constant currency?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Correct.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
And in your guidance, are you maintaining the same prior outlook for the decline in the dollar, I think, the 5% throughout the year?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. We've factored in a modest. The fact of the matter is I think the U.S. dollar has – our viewpoint is it's kind of trending a little bit stronger. I don't think it's a material change, but it's a little bit more of a drag than we thought.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Well, thanks so much for taking my call.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kaczmarek of Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Kevin Kaczmarek - Zelman & Associates
Hey. Thanks, guys. A number of large lenders, notably Bank of America, P&C and Fifth Third, among others, have announced major upgrades to their – either their loan origination systems and/or mortgage servicing software systems over the past few quarters. Can you tell us about how your relationship is with some of these lenders? And how it changes when a major software and workflow change goes through like this? I mean, how do you get in there and try to increase the use of your flood, credit and data valuation products in that scenario?

Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, as a settlement service provider, we have very strong connections with our lenders out there. And if they switch software, we usually – we work with them and – to write the interfaces and the data maps to include our products in their offerings out there. But there's two areas that we work with. One is with the lenders themselves would request it, if they are switching it from one provider to another.
And the other area is we also work with the providers out there. I think of credit for example, it's kind of like the de facto standard with any origination system that you would touch. So, we do try to work with them on placing our products with good placement.
Kevin Kaczmarek - Zelman & Associates
Okay. And if we're thinking about maybe some incremental revenue from those opportunities, do you have a sense of where you might find it, maybe in flood or some valuation products or data?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
As to the extent that it's incremental in terms of installation, yeah. But most of these things, if they are switching from one provider to another, we are already there.
Kevin Kaczmarek - Zelman & Associates
Okay. All right. I think all the rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question is from Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Your line is open.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Oscar.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi. So, you mentioned, I think, in you opening comments that there were some headwinds from lenders reducing spending. Can you provide more color on the types of products that banks are curtailing spending on because I thought that increased regulation could be somewhat of a long-term tailwind for you guys as lenders reduce the number of vendors?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think what that meant was standards in the past couple of years were not established out there. And now, we are seeing a little bit, especially with TRID being behind us for a while and some of the other things that they have relationships with, whether it's CFPB or other regulatory agency. They kind of know what is expected of them.
Prior to this, lenders had to make their own guess. So, as they do it, there was a lot of information to be gathered about knowing your customer, so to speak. Now, they know clear standards have been established. So, there – that was the shift a little bit. I think, in the long term, there will be tailwinds for us because of all the regulatory impacts because the kind of things that the lenders have to comply with now is a lot more than what they had before. And a lot of those things are going to be served by providers such as us.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then, I saw that credit inquiries were up 17% in the quarter. But I think credit screening revenue was up low-single digit percentage. Can you just talk about what's driving the lower pricing there?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Oscar, I think Dan can parse out the – there isn't lower pricing. There could be some mix differences because, within our credit volumes, we have auto and we have a lender. So, there's some different mix – it could be a mix issue. But we have not had a price change or a price decline.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Eric M. Robinson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Yeah. Thanks, guys. You've got Eric Robinson on the line here for Jason. Thanks for taking the call. Just on the VSG kind of business and that revenue for the quarter. Is that a fair run rate, kind of, assuming going forward here? And was FNC included for the full quarter?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
No. FNC was basically two months of the quarter. And I'd say, in terms of a run rate, obviously, property valuation, there's a seasonal characteristic to it. So you will typically see a stronger second and third quarter than first and fourth quarters. I'd say that we're only beginning. So I think there's growth opportunity beyond the volumes that you saw. Obviously, we're – primarily, our volume is primarily being driven by the RELS and the LandSafe, which are two firms, Wells Fargo and Bank of America driven. So, as I mentioned earlier, once we have a broad market offering, then obviously the volumes should increase significantly.
Eric M. Robinson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Got it, got it. And then, just on the VSG margins itself, what kind of – or could you talk about the specifics that are needed to improve those VSG margins over time? I know that FNC comes on at a higher margin, but if we think about the cadence of the margin expansion there, what are the specific drivers that could help those margins?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah. I think if – to me, there's two areas. One is on the – there's a data and analytics component to VSG and a platform component. That's at margins rates that are higher than our aggregate margin percentages. So we obviously want to grow in those areas, and that will affect the margin percentage in the right way.
In terms of the volumes that relate to property appraisal, we think that we can, from a process perspective, improve cycle times and reduce the inefficiencies in the process, thereby improving the margins. And then also realize the benefits of scale, very similar to what we did in flood, credit and tax over the last three or four years is to scale up and drive efficiency and automation.
So we think – we talked about this before. We think the margin rates in the aggregate for VSG shouldn't look a whole lot different than the total company margin rates once the full platform is built out.
Eric M. Robinson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
And then you think that would take a couple-year timeline here. Is that the right framework to think about? Or -
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. It'll take two, three years, I think, to really come to full realization. Obviously, we're going to make progress along the way. FNC is a high-margin company, obviously. Our data analytics are high margin. So, from that perspective, we have a lot of high-margin assets already in the portfolio. And as Anand mentioned, if we look at the M&A landscape, that would be a nice area to tack on some capabilities.
Eric M. Robinson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. A few number questions. I guess the first one, just sort of thinking of the 3Q EBITDA, you sort of talked about it being roughly in line with 2Q to maybe modestly up. Most of the mortgage forecasts at this point are actually up sequentially 3Q versus 2Q, and I would think that the $15 million of sort of one-time costs you had this quarter would moderate. So I guess what I'm getting at is that 3Q seems awfully conservative, or I'm missing something.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I think if you look at the, certainly, the MBA quarterly forecast, I hate to get that granular, but it's really – I think it's – they're calling very – essentially a flat quarterly viewpoint. So, hopefully, it's better than that, but I think they're talking about 500 versus like 520, so it's pretty – and then a lot of that's price, and so I don't think there's going to be a huge upswing. I think some of that depends on your point of view about refi and how long the refi activity is going to be elevated because of the Brexit and all that kind of stuff. But as Anand said, we're not counting on that to necessarily drive a lot of upside in the third quarter.

James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah. And just to add to Frank's comments, we're going to have integration costs associated with FNC. But also we'll have some real estate costs as a result of our productivity program there as we're consolidating footprints that we'll hit in the second half of the year.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
So, as it relates to that, I think when we entered the year, we were talking about the $10 million to $12 million of VSG sort of one-time costs and there was another $10 million of costs related to the savings program and it seems like at least year-to-date you're through that. But now you're talking about incremental costs, so there are additional one-time costs or what's the magnitude of the one-time costs above what you talked about entering the year?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
No, I don't think they're one-time costs, Glenn. I think the costs we talked about are things like compliance, infosec and I think those – every – we're in the same boat probably more or so than our competitors because of our scale. We have to invest in ongoing and compliance and I think that's a strength.
I think one of the discussions earlier was about compliance and the regulatory environment. I think it's our strength and clearly we've benefited for the last couple of years. It's like the quality where people are looking at, quality vendors and we're certainly one of them, so we have to invest in those areas. I don't think those are one-time...
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
The integration stuff is lumpier in one-time, but the infosec, that kind of stuff is a cost of doing business. There may be a quarter that's a little heavier than others, but that's kind of an ongoing in my opinion.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then, just to frame it relative to the 3% you sort of called out the organic growth for the core products, the 3%. As we've looked at the back half, is there a way to think directionally about some more organic growth parameters for PI and RMW? How should we be thinking about that?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Well, we are focused significantly on raising that growth rate. As I mentioned, we have a lot of levers to do it. So, we're going to fight like nobody's business to get those growth rates up in the second half of the year and I think we had a pretty good selling season towards the back half of the second quarter, which gives us some confidence level. But it's a little bit of uncertain times and on it are a list of people are – I think we lose track of the fact that a lot of our clients are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the regulatory environment, and that's sapping in their ability to look at proactive and other spending areas that traditionally they would have done.
So – but I think, having said all that, we have a good product array coming out in the market. We have good traction on our new products and we think that growth rate should come up. We'll prove that over the second half of the year.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And just one more I'll just squeeze in. But the bridge to the $0.15 change in EPS, I guess, something like $0.10, $0.11 of it is the EBITDA change and I guess the balance is the refinancing?
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.
Yeah, that's reasonable. It's about $0.04 to $0.05.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
James L. Balas - Chief Financial Officer, CoreLogic, Inc.

Dan L. Smith - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations

Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dan and good morning everyone. Welcome to CoreLogic's fourth quarter earnings call. I will lead off the call today with a recap of our 2015 operating results as well as strategic areas of focus for 2016. Frank will summarize fourth quarter financial results and discuss 2016 guidance before we go to Q&A.
CoreLogic delivered very strong results in 2015. For the year, revenues, operating income, and net income, free cash flow and EPS grew significantly and were all at record levels. We exceeded our financial targets and outperformed the market volumes in our core mortgage related operations. Importantly, we also continued to make progress with regards to our strategic business plan which has been our guide over the past five years.

As I have outlined on past calls, we are focused on a strategic program which includes the following four imperatives. One, achieving market leadership in our core Property Intelligence underwriting and Risk Management solutions businesses. Two, driving operating leverage and expanding margins through process reengineering, workflow optimization and cost efficiency. Three, optimizing our existing technology infrastructure and launching the CoreLogic Innovation Center and our Gen2 platform. And four, building financial flexibility and consistently returning capital to our shareholders.
CoreLogic celebrated its fifth anniversary as a publicly-traded company in 2015. Over the past five years, during a period of rapid change and unprecedented market headwinds, we transformed our company into a global leader providing must have data-driven property insight to an expanding blue-chip client base. We invested to build high operating leverage in our core business units and fostered technology leadership and innovation.
We have also improved our quality and service by driving significant operating efficiencies. Over the past five years, we have delivered consistent growth in revenues, profits, and cash flow. Specifically, since 2011, we grew revenues at a compounded rate of 9%, adjusted EBITDA by 15%, and adjusted EPS by 30%. At the same time, we prudently invested in our business for long-term growth and returned more than $830 million in capital to our shareholders.
Today, our core solutions truly sit at the heart of the global housing ecosystem. Our ability to consistently grow revenues in areas where we can secure market leadership and scale has been one of the keys to our success. Over the past five years, we have transformed the mix of our business to highlight data, analytics, and data-enabled solutions that help our clients address critical underwriting and risk management activities. This business mix has also helped us to improve profitability and increase free cash flow.
As I mentioned earlier, CoreLogic delivered record operating results in 2015. Revenues were up 9%, operating income from continuing operations was up 20%, adjusted EBITDA was up 17%, and adjusted EPS was up 43%. Revenue in 2015 totaled $1.53 billion. Reported revenues grew 11% in our Property Intelligence segment. On a constant currency basis, Property Intelligence grew 15%. Our Risk Management and Work Flow segment grew 7% fueled by higher market volumes, pricing and share gains.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% to $423 million in 2015. This increase was largely the result of revenue growth and the benefits of productivity which more than offset investments in innovation, technology, and ongoing cost management programs.
Our strong financial results in 2015 reflect the strength of our business model. We are entering 2016 with a clear pathway to sustain growth. Our unique products and solutions help our clients to more precisely underwrite and manage their risks and capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise. One of the ways we are continuing to drive market leadership is through the realignment of our company to effectively address the current and emerging strategic, regulatory, and market-based needs of our clients.
Our press release yesterday outlines our updated operating segmentation which we believe aligns with the evolving ways that our clients source and consume property information and data enabled workflow services.
In line with our strategic objective of providing scaled and data enabled solutions, we launched the Valuation Solution Group or VSG in the fourth quarter of 2015. Over $4 billion is spent annually on residential property valuation. This area remains one of several underwriting and risk management activities in the property ecosystem that we believe would benefit from enhanced technology and the application of data and analytics.

The VSG will provide a comprehensive array of property valuation and collateral assessment solutions and the technology platforms that connect market participants with supply chain service providers. The opportunity to transform the way assets in a real estate transaction are valued and to bring greater transparency to the process makes this a significant medium and long-term growth opportunity for us. We acquired LandSafe Appraisal Services and full ownership of RELS valuation in a second half of 2015. These businesses provide real estate asset valuation and appraisal solutions.
In December 2015, we also entered into an agreement to acquire FNC, a leading provider of real estate collateral information technology and solutions that automate property appraisal workflows. The FNC transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The combination of LandSafe, RELS and FNC together with CoreLogic's existing Property Intelligence assets provide the foundational elements of a scaled, integrated solutions provider powered by a broad suite of fulfillment platform, data and analytics capabilities.
Completing the integration of our capabilities and realizing the full potential of the VSG will be a significant multi-year endeavor, but we believe the opportunities for our firm and the industry could be transformative. In many ways, the creation of the VSG demonstrates the power and opportunities resident in the increasing integration of CoreLogic's data analytical tools, domain expertise and technological capabilities.
The U.S. mortgage market is continuing to transition to a purchase-driven cycle. With market fundamentals improving, purchase volumes are gathering steam and should help to at least partially offset the expected drop in refinancing activity in 2016. With sustainable job creation and overall economic recovery, we expect to see healthier housing starts and inventory levels over time. Overall, we believe this transition has set the stage for a more sustainable real-estate market for this year and beyond.
In closing, CoreLogic delivered record operating results in 2015. I believe our strong performance demonstrates the benefits and value creation opportunities inherent in our strategic plan. We are deeply embedded in our clients' critical works flows. Our scale and ability to invest in the VSG and other unique solution sets; compliance, automation, and data-enabled services as well as our reputation for delivering a high level of quality and service has made us a preferred partner for businesses and government agencies with a need for property intelligence and insights.
I want to thank our employees, clients and shareholders for their continued support. As always, our focus remains squarely on strong operational execution and positioning CoreLogic for a superior long-term growth and stakeholder value creation.
With that, I'll turn it over to Frank.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Anand. Good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to recap our fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide some additional color around our cost management programs and 2016 guidance.
As Anand mentioned earlier, 2015 was an outstanding year for CoreLogic. Operationally we continue to shift our business mix towards data-driven subscription based models built around scaled industry currency solutions. The strength of our business model and free cash flow profile allows us to invest in product and service innovation and operational improvements. At the same time, we have a well-established track record of returning significant capital to our shareholders and managing our debt balances.
Over the past year, we strengthened our client engagement, further integrated and streamlined our organizational structure, and drove significant cost efficiencies. We also enhanced our technology leadership by ramping up the CoreLogic Innovation Center and completing the multiyear transition of our IT infrastructure to a managed service provider.

From a financial point of view, our 2015 full year revenues, operating and net income, free cash flow and EPS were significantly above prior year levels and exceeded our financial targets. We drove up adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 200 basis points to 28% while investing in our product and service development, compliance and IT capabilities. We converted 60% of our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow and returned 38% of that to our shareholders by repurchasing almost 3% of our common shares. Since 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 29%.
With regard to the fourth quarter of 2015, financial highlights include the following. First, top-line gains in each of our operating segments with accelerating organic growth trends in Property Intelligence. Second, market outperformance in Risk Management Work Flow. Third, the successful launch of the VSG including the acquisitions of LandSafe and RELS and the pending acquisition of FNC. And fourth and finally, the completion of our cost management program.
Fourth quarter revenues totaled $391 million, 13% higher than prior year as market share gains, organic growth and acquisition related revenues more than offset unfavorable FX translation. Property Intelligence or PI segment revenues rose 24% to $192 million fueled by growth in insurance, Spatial Solutions, international, and core property data as well as the launch of the VSG which collectively were partially offset by FX.
PI organic growth rates accelerated in Q4 resulting in a full year 2015 growth rate of approximately 5.5%. VSG revenues in the fourth quarter were $34 million. Benefits from market share and pricing gains drove Risk Management and Work Flow or RMW segment revenues up 4% year-over-year to $201 million despite modestly lower U.S. mortgage loan application volumes, the impact of reduced document processing and retrieval revenues and the planned run-off of a non-core credit reporting service.
Operating income from continuing operations totaled $27 million for the quarter compared with $36 million in 2014 as benefits from revenue gains and productivity were offset by one-time expenses related to VSG launch and cost reduction programs which aggregated $14 million. Before the effect of these items, CoreLogic operating income from continuing operations increased by approximately $5 million or 14%.
Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations totaled $38 million compared to $16 million in the same 2014 period. The $21 million year-over-year increase was driven primarily by operating upsides and a $26 million after tax gain on investments associated with the RELS acquisition which were partially offset by higher tax provisions, unfavorable FX translation and costs associated with the launch of VSG and efficiency programs.
Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.35, up 25% year-over-year reflecting the positive impacts of growth, expense efficiencies, and share repurchases. Diluted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.42 compared with $0.18 in Q4 of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $88 million in the fourth quarter compared with $84 million last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of revenue growth and benefits of expense reduction programs, which were partially offset by costs attributable to the VSG launch, ongoing productivity actions, and unfavorable FX.
PI segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $47 million for the quarter compared with $48 million in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was modestly higher than prior year on a local currency basis. During the quarter, the benefit of higher revenues funded investments in efficiency innovations of VSG.
RMW adjusted EBITDA was $50 million, consistent with the same prior year period as the benefits of share gains in tax, flood, and credit services and improved pricing were offset by one-time cost efficiency programs, lower document processing and retrieval revenues and the run-off of a non-core credit reporting service.

Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin was 22% compared with 24% in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to the investments in efficiency innovation of the VSG, which I discussed earlier.
I will focus the balance of my remarks today on cost management and 2016 guidance. As our long-term shareholders know, our commitment to a rigorous and ongoing focus on productivity margin expansion has been an integral part of our growth and success. Earlier in 2015, we announced a program designed to lower run rate expenses by $60 million exiting 2017.
Savings are expected to be realized with the consolidation facilities, reduction in SG&A cost, outsourcing of certain business activities and other operational improvements. I'm pleased to report today that we achieved our $15 million in 2015 savings and we are on track to generate additional savings of $30 million and $15 million in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
In terms of financial guidance for 2016, we announced on January 28, we expect to generate revenues of between $1.83 billion and $1.86 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $465 million to $485 million and adjusted EPS of $2.05 to $2.15. Each range incorporates significant increases in 2015 actual results. Our guidance is based on the following main assumptions. First, U.S. mortgage loan origination unit volumes are down 15% from 2015.
Second, targeted cost savings at least $30 million. Third, the successful integration of LandSafe and RELS with integration costs expected to total $10 million to $12 million. Fourth, the completion of the FNC acquisition by March 31. Fifth, U.S. dollar appreciation against the Australian and New Zealand dollars and the euro of approximately 5%. And finally, the opportunistic repurchases of common shares and the management of our net debt to adjusted EBITDA in line with our long-term targets.
Our long stated capital allocation strategy remains in place. We will continue to reinvest in product and service development, productivity, and cost management programs and we'll opportunistically repurchase common shares and retire outstanding debt. In terms of the first quarter of 2016 based on seasonality in our currency origination unit volumes, we believe that adjusted EBITDA should be modestly above first quarter 2015 levels. This favorable year-over-year performance includes the absorption of significant one-time costs associated with the VSG launch and ongoing cost productivity programs.
To sum it up, 2015 was another outstanding year for CoreLogic strategically, operationally and financially. As we enter into 2016, our scaled and unique data-driven underwriting and risk management solutions are our platforms for sustained growth and market leadership.
Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, guys. Looking just on the year, just look at (21:56) going forward when you think of the Valuation Solutions Group that you've put together, your initiatives and some of the deals you've done (22:03), what kind of growth profile should this business have? Correlated is that business actually to originations versus some of your others that (22:12) may be a little less so. And what is – in terms of color on the strategy longer term around (22:15) how big that could be. Thanks.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Darrin, this is Frank. You broke up a little bit but I'll try to answer your question, and please add if I don't. As Anand mentioned, this is an enormous space. It's over $4 billion annually. We look at this as a multi-vertical opportunity, not just mortgage although mortgage is obviously a significant portion of that. As Anand mentioned, we look at this as a significant growth engine for the company in the next several years. I think the growth rates could be very, very significant even though through the acquisition of FNC, LandSafe and RELS in addition to our existing capabilities, we already have a very significant amount of revenue related to property evaluation and assessment in both the financial services and the insurance vertical I'll say as well as I think public sector. So it's a big opportunity, a high growth opportunity. As Anand mentioned, I think the other thing is we do – it will take a couple of years to fully mature. We're going out at bringing data and analytics which we think will hopefully transform the way property valuation is done over time. So it's a big opportunity, big revenue opportunity, and I think a big strategic opportunity for the company across many verticals.

Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. I guess, when we look at the underlying growth for 2016, I think it's comforting for a lot of investors to see that you're including a conservative assumption of like a 15% drop off in originations. Can you just give us maybe in a different way to look at how you're approaching a flattish type growth rate in EBITDA? How much of that actually is from cost versus growth and where the growth initiatives are? Like, where we would expect to see growth in the other parts of your business on the top-line?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So I think first of all – I think broadly speaking, at this point origination volumes, it's fairly unclear starting off the year. I think we're seeing some positive signals in terms of rates not being quite as high as I think initially forecast, but you're also seeing some weather and some other offset. So we want to make sure as we have in the past years that we're not over shooting from a market projection perspective.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Right. Makes sense.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
I think in terms of growth, we still see a lot of growth in insurance. Spatial has been a good growth on a local currency, strong growth in international. So we're riding a number of different horses in the PI segment. There's a lot of organic growth as well as it relates to valuations, things like our LSAM product which has been adopted widely across the industry in the valuation space. So we're seeing some good growth there. We did see acceleration as I mentioned in the organic growth rate in the fourth quarter in PI. That was a big topic on our third quarter call. We did see a pick up there. We exited the year in the fourth year just under 5%, and for the year a little bit under 6%. So that was a pretty good performance coming out of the year, so we expect that kind of performance level to continue as we go forward. So I think there's a lot of different growth drivers there. Clearly, cost management is going to help us to absorb any downside related to the volumes as they appear. I think, we feel like we're really on solid ground to get the $30 million that we committed to last year and so that's I think a very good insurance policy as well.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right, thanks. Last question – go ahead.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Just add to that, Darrin on the strategy on VSG. We believe that there is a ton of things that are in our favor. The last time when we got out of being a direct appraisal management company, there wasn't any way to limit the exposure to liabilities. Standards were loose and the level of automation to bring transparency into the process wasn't valued as much. And with we have seen with our automated valuation models and the growth in LoanSafe Appraisal Manager, and the increased sign up and growth of industry leaders in the appraisal consortium that we run along with the insurance vertical, we believe that there is enough opportunities to grow even outside of the entities that we have that we're bringing in to the VSG.
Valuation today is at the center of mortgage performance along with borrower qualification. Regulatory controls are strict to warrant transparency into the process. There is a lot more consistency in the valuation methodology. We see that in the need for that's consistently coming up in the appraisal consortiums and the availability of comprehensive data and analytics to assess risk, especially replacement cost data and Spatial Solutions. Those are all the things that made us feel very confident about VSG.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Okay. All right, that's helpful. Just last quick question for a little more maintenance fees (27:57) on the free cash flow conversion. I think you were right around 60%. Is there anything – I mean I know you guys consistently have said like 50% to 55% more or less. You've also said that's going to potentially improve over time. Anything changing or anything unusual about the last year's free cash conversion that we should – that couldn't recur in terms of converting from EBITDA at that rate?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think there was one anomaly that accounted for about $30 million of benefit in last year. So if you normalize, we're still in the low 50%s.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
And that's been pretty consistent.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And that's what we should expect...?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Now, obviously I think as we talked about, the other thing is (28:39) I think the mix is progressively improving our cash generative nature over time for sure.
Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
All right. All right, very helpful, guys. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bose George with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, guys. This is actually Chas Tyson on for Bose. I just wanted to ask on the VSG opportunity. Is that an opportunity that you feel like you can generate a lot of scale in. I mean there's kind of a fair amount of fixed cost to scale out over? Or is it probably going to be pretty consistently a 15% to 20% EBITDA margin type of business?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
We believe that the scale could be improved, and I also think that the margin profile could also be improved. What we are talking about, the numbers that you're saying are the traditional percentages. And one of the things that we kind of outlined and that's one of the reasons we say it's going to be a multi-year effort is to kind of move that needle up as we bring in more data and more analytics into the whole process.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And is that due to kind of what you've done on some of the Risk Management Work Flow businesses where you automate the business a little more and maybe take some of the higher cost aspects out of it?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
Automation plays a role, but I think data plays a bigger role and analytics will pay a bigger role in it. Up until now like we talked about, the replacement cost data and Spatial data were not part of it. They were disjointed and what we are pegging on is to bring all of these solutions into an integrated way and FNC like we said, is still in process. FNC is the network utility that kind of actually connects it with the technology stacks of the consuming lenders.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then on the insurance and Spatial revenue line, I know that had been trending kind of in the high double-digit year-over-year growth range. Can you just maybe help us out with how that grew in the fourth quarter and how you guys see that growing over 2016?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So in terms of the underwriting, slightly lower growth. We've had good growth internationally and with our Spatial Solutions unit. And then kind of a lower growth rate on the core underwriting business that it's a traditional business that we acquired from MSB a couple of years ago. But overall the combined growth rate was very strong this year. And I think we expect that to come back a little bit that and puts into our guidance in 2016 to a more normalized level in the mid-single-digits with Spatial probably growing more in the low double-digits as we go forward. Spatial is roughly half of that revenue stream. So you'll have a blend – the blended should be in the upper single-digits.

Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Should we think that the fourth quarter was kind of close to that upper-single digits metric?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it was a little bit higher actually. We traditionally – there's some timing always to the year-end with some data sales, et cetera. But it was slightly higher than the numbers I just gave you.
Chas Tyson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. Good morning. Maybe if we could just come back to VSG a little bit. A lot of moving parts embedded in your fiscal 2016 guide including the RELS, LandSafe and then FNC, but maybe so we can get a better sense for the organic growth contribution. Could you give us a sense for the aggregate revenue contribution for the VSG components that you're sort of thinking about going into fiscal 2016 and then I have got a couple of follow-ups.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Glenn. This is Frank. I mean obviously the vast majority of the VSG revenue is going to be coming through the acquisitions that Anand mentioned. We do have a fairly significant amount of data and analytics related valuation solutions that are growing I think in kind of an upper single digit growth rate through 2015 which we would expect to continue in 2016. So I'd say for the organic growth element of VSG, it's in that upper-single digits in 2016. And it's very significant revenue obviously contributed by the VSG. The focus is on the integration of LandSafe and RELS which are appraisal-focused. I think there is a lot of synergy there. There is a lot of integration and efficiency and operating leverage there because you're bringing two fairly significant players with established panels together, so you can imagine the synergy there.
Obviously we need to make sure that that's done very, very carefully so there's no disruption in service. And then in terms of FNC as Anand mentioned, I think the major assumption at this moment is the closure by the end of the first quarter. That's obviously beyond our direct control. It's regulatory and normal closing conditions that have to be assumed. But assuming that closes, as Anand mentioned, that's a tremendous – the important platform in the industry and a tremendously sticky high margin business which makes our content that much more consumable within the industry. That firm has over 110 lenders on their platform so that gives the great distribution channel for other products beyond even VSG. So we're excited about that. So I think those are the major moving parts of VSG. Very, very high obviously inorganic growth, I think reasonably high organic growth through primarily the analytical piece within CoreLogic, that's in the PI segment.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
That's helpful. Let me try this another way. If we think about the PI and RMW segments at this point, it sounds like PI was close to 5% organic in 2015. Is that a reasonable expectation ex the acquisitions? And for RMW, I'm kind of thinking low-single-digit organic, ex sort of macro factors and FX. Are those kind of reasonable expectations?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'd say we were about 5.5% in PI non-VSG. I'd say that's a reasonably good assumption for 2016 based on the assumptions I gave you in terms of the market, et cetera. And then I think your other assumption's fine.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then just one quick follow-up. You're obviously spending I think it was $10 million or $12 million on integration related to VSG with the idea that there's some efficiencies and cost savings attached to that which my guess is you're going to start to realize and recognize in fiscal 2017. Is there a way to frame kind of the saving opportunity going into 2017?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
That really is going to be in the run rate, Glenn. So I think as we guide for 2017, it will be an all included number. Most of what we're spending on VSG is integration and transactional related. So as we guide, I think those numbers will be inside the guidance numbers for 2017.
Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thank you. So a question on VSG with the competitors that you will be going up against. Is it mostly in-house or are there other larger competitors or is it fragmented and just talk about how VSG will be differentiated versus those other solutions?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think as Anand mentioned – I'll let Anand – there's nobody that looks like the CoreLogic offering today in terms of breadth and depth, the data elements of it. We're trying to bring something very unique to the market through the infusion of data and analytics which we think is very unique. There're many, many, many players in property valuation. It's a very fragmented space. We see the opportunity there in terms of creating something scale. So I think this is quite different and the opportunity is quite different. We're not going in this to be another small player in appraisal. So I think it's quite unique actually.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
This is Anand. Jason, I think the path to the future in VSG will be very similar to what happened in past. You had a few in-house and a big provider like us and then there was a highly fragmented industry. And you see that fragmentation being consolidated because the regulatory controls are such that they want the products and the service to be provided by bankable (38:50) providers and the lenders want the same thing. And we see the same thing happening in VSG. As you saw with the LandSafe and with RELS, these were captives. And we have had a lot of captives in our NJV that we have operated from before and we see that being unlocked and getting over to a situation like VSG and we see that trend growing.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thanks. That's very helpful. And then a question on 2016 guidance and thinking about it by segment. Just given the assumption that you're going to have the unit origination volumes down 15%. Should we think then for RMW that revenue and EBITDA should be down on the year just given that assumption? And then you're going to have some organic growth from the PI segment and then the acquisition benefit in PI. Is that the right way to kind of think about the segments for the year?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Obviously, we don't really guide by segment, but I wouldn't say that's necessarily the case. Obviously the growth rates which had been very strong last couple of years despite mortgage market fluctuations. In RMW, that will not necessarily be negative. We had some positive factors related to share gains coming through that were secured in 2015, pricing et cetera, so there are some offsets there. It may not be as robust as it's been in past years but certainly I think it's not necessarily a negative.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Gamaitoni with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Thanks for taking my call. The $30-ish million step up quarter-over-quarter in the VSG line, was that just LandSafe or is Cordell in there as well?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Cordell is not a VSG. That's LandSafe.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
What is Cordell?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Cordell is actually – it's a property information company, small company in Australia.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then can you give us any indication of kind of the margin of the VSG business. Is it similar to PI? Will it be lower to start and then grow over time, ex the charges? I'm just trying to understand the EBITDA margin kind of outlook for the PI business?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think as Anand mentioned, it's going to be lower than the aggregate margin of, traditional margin of PI in the short run but we expect that to be on a trajectory to come closer to that margin rate over the next couple of years through scale, leverage, et cetera.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
New products.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
And the mix of the revenue which in 2016 will be skewed more towards the traditional appraisal work, and then because obviously things like FNC which is just partial year. So the richer mix of higher margin businesses will be more on display in 2017 as we see the full build out come into play.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
And the timing of – think you had mentioned in the first quarter there is going to be more of the cost related to the cost efficiencies in VSG. Can you give us like a split of what percentage of all that will fall into the first quarter and kind of in throughout the year just a rough sense?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So clearly, the heavier expenditure is going to be in the first half of the year. We're trying to get as much done as we possibly can, early as possible. The challenge is more on the VSG side because we need to – we have client consideration and other things to make sure that we're doing the right thing. So that's a little bit a slower but on the cost programs, et cetera, we're trying to go as quickly as we can. So the skew is more in the first half of the year, than the second half.
Chris Gamaitoni - Autonomous Research US LP
Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Hayden Blair - Stephens, Inc.
Hey guys. This is actually Hayden sitting in for John. I'm curious once VSG is ramped up a bit, can you help us frame up maybe some new kind of sensitivity analysis related to mortgage originations with that addition and with the segment realignment and that would be helpful either on a segment level or maybe just a total company level as well.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, we can do that. I think we won't have time on this call but I think we'll provide that as we move forward.
Hayden Blair - Stephens, Inc.
Got it. And then real quickly here. Are there any other large lenders like Bank of America that you can think you can win on the VSG front? I mean were those BAC and Wells deals kind of part of a larger trend in outsourcing these or were those kind of one-off deals talking only about kind of the top five or top 10 lenders?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Bank of America is in the VSG through the LandSafe Appraisal Services. But to go back to the second part of your question, I believe so. I think you see a lot of trend towards consolidated service providers and integrated service providers who can bring a lot to the table, especially like I said in my commentary that the valuation is now center of the mortgage performance along with borrower qualification.

You got to get that thing right. And so there's a heightened need to make sure that they look at all the data, the lenders look at all the data as possible to take that value right. And also there's – regulatory controls are strict enough to warrant a heavy amount of transparency into the process, which are all things that we could help, especially major lenders.
Hayden Blair - Stephens, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great, thank you. Hey, has there been any kind of meaningful change in tone or anything obviously real nice job on the positive pre-announcement. But fast forward to today, anything kind of changed in the last six weeks or so or was it always going to be the assumption that originations were down 15% or is that up from down 10%?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
No, nothing has changed. Same as what we released on the 28th.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. And then just – as you think longer-term, how should we think about margin progression, particularly given what's been a nice strategic shift towards the VSG. What does that do to the margin profile of the business? And is there a way to kind of frame, is it – what are you targeting from a margin perspective?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We still believe, Kevin, that a long-term margin trajectory in the 30% is achievable. Clearly, in the short run, we'll have a lot more dollars of profit. Margin percentages will likely be a little bit more challenging in the short run because you're adding a fair amount of revenue in the integration, et cetera, in 2016, but we're doing a lot of the cost structure. We still think there's efficiency, as Anand mentioned, I think the long-term margin profile for VSG should be positive.
So we're still convinced that the long-term target of above 30% makes sense for the mix of the company as it evolves. I think, in the short run, we just need to work hard to offset the integration in bringing VSG to the realization of its potential, which obviously we have the plan that we just talked about to do that.
Kevin McVeigh - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Just to round out the margin answer, one of the things that we're looking at and we're happy with VSG is, we know that it's going to take a while to kind of get the margins to where we are happy with. But one of the other characteristics that we're seeing increasing at CoreLogic is that all of these businesses that we're now gathering and getting into and increasing in size and scale are heavy cash flow businesses. And that's a positive thing for us going into the future.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keane McCarthy with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Keane J. McCarthy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks. How are you viewing tread (48:30)? Are you viewing it as positive or negative for your guys as volumes? And then, I know it's still early with the roll out being in October of last year, but are you seeing customers rely less, more on the data that you provide?
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
We don't see much of a change. I would just say, it's just a new process and we offered it as part of our solutions, because it's needed from a Mortgage Technology Solutions perspective. But we don't see any drastic changes to influx or any change at all.
Keane J. McCarthy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, I guess, with respect to the VSG segment, how does the rollout of tread (49:22) impact it if at all, in terms of the documentation or importance that lenders and third parties are putting on kind of the valuation and appraisal side of the closing?

Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
I don't think it's dramatically impacting anything. If at all what we're talking about is to pack that process with more analytics, more front-end things. Frank just mentioned about the increased adoption of LoanSafe Appraisal manager, which kind of tells us that they want to get the intelligence further up the process. That's the only main difference that we have seen.
Keane J. McCarthy - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, final one. With the tech-enabled network of appraisers that sounds like a few years away for the VSG, it seems like a pretty good opportunity and interesting. Just curious, is there anything like that in the market right now? And if there's any competitive what's that like that and then how would the lenders work with the third-party providers on that network? Thanks.
Anand K. Nallathambi - President and Chief Executive Officer
FNC is a major foundational step towards that. And on top of it, you're talking about all the spatial and environmental data that we can bring in, in terms of a risk management perspective and analytics would be a unique thing in the marketplace. But from a tech-enabled network, FNC is already well on its way. But like we mentioned, we want to caution that it's still in process for the regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'd say, Keane, just one other point to Anand's. There's a tremendous demand for insight and data validation and accuracy and improvement in cycle times in the property valuation space, which all plays right down into CoreLogic's wheelhouse. So from that perspective, we think this is going to be an area that just is perfect for the integration of CoreLogic's data analytics and data-enabled workflow platforms because we have, we believe the most comprehensive data out there, nobody can match that, that we know of in the marketplace today, the breadth of analytics.
So I think the VSG sets up very well according to strategic elements, and Anand talked about scale, data enablement, operating leverage, et cetera. So I think it's going to be a – VSG is going to drive demand for CoreLogic data and solutions because it's such a pain point for the industry right now in terms of getting properties valued quickly and accurately.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Nick J. Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, thanks. This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. It might be tough, given the realignment, but any color you guys can provide on how the legacy D&A organic performance would have been in the quarter? I know you mentioned PI rebounded, but just given the deceleration last quarter, wondering from an industry perspective, if you're seeing anything different?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the D&A segment, I think I referred to it in my presentation. But the D&A segment, more or less pretty close to apples and apples. It was up about 4.5% in the fourth quarter, which was an acceleration of the third quarter. When we finished the year, the D&A number was about 5.5% for the full year. So we did clearly see a reacceleration of that organic growth profile.
Nick J. Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. Thanks. And just circling back to the mortgage market expectations that are baked in the guidance, I think, the MBA is forecasting about a 9% decline. So is it kind of fair to say that your outlook is something similar as well as the interest rate outlook for 2016, and then just adding on some price increases to that?

Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'd say that we look at the MBA, I'd say, it's pretty good proxy. I mean, it's early days obviously but the market was better in 2015. Obviously then we are going into – people thought going into 2015. Hopefully that can be the case in 2016, but it's kind of early days.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Veytsman with Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. Could you give a little more color around the share gains with the RMW business during the fourth quarter and what we can potentially expect for 2016?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think, Alex, the share gains were similar to what they've been. They've been concentrated in tax and flood, but I think increasingly in credit as well. I think it's a combination of factors that continue to spur that on. I think Anand mentioned, flight to quality. I mean, the compliance area has been one that, over the last couple of years, benefited CoreLogic because of our scale and our investment in our compliance infrastructure. And I think it continues to favor bigger and more robust suppliers. We are a strategic partner for a lot of clients. So that's where a lot of the share gains have come.
We continue to focus – and that's been a lot of spending on efficiency, cycle time quality, and that's clearly borne fruit there, but a pretty good distribution. We had very significant share gains in the early part of the year on tax. Those will flow through in a full year effect in 2016, so that all looks pretty good for our RMW and allows us to outperform the overall market trends in 2016.
Alexander Veytsman - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
Great, that helps. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In the past, you've spoken about the goal of bringing your mortgage market exposure down to the 40% to 50% range over the long-term. I was just wondering, does the company still maintain this target? And what is your mortgage exposure for 2016 taking into account these recent acquisitions?
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So our mortgage exposure, and frankly we've reduced it through growth, and we talk about that percentage as U.S. mortgage exposure. So we've grown from – we used to be about 90% U.S. mortgage related. That dropped back to about 60% through a combination of really growth in insurance, Spatial Solutions, international, et cetera. With VSG clearly, that's going to add back some exposure to the U.S. mortgage market. But really, from our perspective, since we're starting from a base of zero, and we think this is such a large fragmented consolidation opportunity.
I think that additional exposure is actually pretty good, because we can do it in a different way at a higher margin. And I think with components like FNC where you have a fairly sticky platform-type industry utility, it's much more uniform in terms of volume expectations. So I think it's clearly it's going go up. I don't have an exact figure, but it's clearly going to go up from 60%. I don't think that's a bad thing frankly, given the opportunity, the transformative opportunity. This is a very, very large transformative opportunity in our opinion. And so I think that additional exposure is worth taking on as we move forward.

Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks. And can you provide any color on how each of the acquired businesses performed during the past periods of mortgage and market volatility? And I completely understand your point about it being a possibly transformative opportunity.
Frank D. Martell - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I would say that, I think, as was discussed earlier. So obviously LandSafe and RELS are essentially one client operation. So they would mirror the outcomes of Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Obviously Wells Fargo has had tremendous success in the mortgage area for many, many years. So both LandSafe and RELS have been successful in their own right supporting those clients. So the relative success would mirror the success of those two end customers in the market.
I think, in case of FNC, it's a much more distributed client base, and I think you see a much more consistent performance in spite of the vicissitudes of the other mortgage market, although clearly obviously there is some impact, but it's not really correlated. And obviously we talk about that there is a tremendous opportunity as it relates to additional clients, particularly as it relates to the appraisal area because we're starting out with concentration of two clients and that we expect that we will be able to grow the third-party revenue.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A portion of the call. We would like thank everyone for attending today's conference call. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
