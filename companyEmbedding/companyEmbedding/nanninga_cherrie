Cherrie Nanninga
A recent addition to RESGroup, Ms. Nanninga was with CBRE, Inc., the world’s leading commercial real estate services firm.  While at CBRE, she served as Chief Operating Officer of the company’s New York Tri-State Region overseeing the day-to-day operations of the region’s nine offices, 2,100 employees and revenue of approximately $700 million.  Her purview included Downtown and Suburban market areas; accounting and financial management; legal services; communications; technology; research; facilities and human resources.  Cherrie has also represented selected clients, including Blue School, Davis Brody Bond and the Metropolitan Television Alliance (“MTVA”), a consortium of New York area television broadcast stations, which was formed to acquire a broadcasting facility location to replace the World Trade Center (“WTC”) facility destroyed on September 11, 2001.  Prior to joining CBRE, Cherrie served as Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Director of Real Estate for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region’s airports, ports, and vehicular transportation facilities.
Ms. Nanninga is credited with closing one of the biggest deals in the history of New York real estate with the net lease of the WTC in July 2001 to Silverstein Properties.  Just months later,after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,she marshaled the relocation of the Port Authority’s 2,300 WTC-based staff members into new office space and she assumed responsibility for real estate matters affecting the redevelopment of the WTC site.
While at the Port Authority, Cherrie over saw the leasing and marketing of the agency’s commercial real estate portfolio, which included 12 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail and other special purpose space, and 500,000 square feet of industrial space, generating lease revenue upward of $450 million annually.  She and her team raised occupancy at the Trade Center from 78% in 1996 to 97% in 2001 and also successfully repositioned the World Trade Center Mall, which became the third- highest grossing shopping center in the country, with annual sales per square foot approaching $1,000 in 2001.
Ms. Nanninga holds Board positions with Lifetime Brands, Inc., the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, The Salvadori Center and is co-founder of The Downtown NYC River to River Festival.
 
Ms. Nanninga has a Master in Business Administration from Stanford University, and a B.A. from the California State University, East Bay.
