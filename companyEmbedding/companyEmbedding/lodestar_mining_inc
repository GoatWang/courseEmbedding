Lode-Star Mining Inc. Auditor Raises 'Going Concern' Doubt
Mar 30 17
Lode-Star Mining Inc. filed its 10-K on Mar 30, 2017 for the period ending Dec 31, 2016. In this report its auditor, Malone & Bailey, PLLC, gave an unqualified opinion expressing doubt that the company can continue as a going concern.


Lode-Star Mining Inc. Signs Letter of Intent with Scorpio Gold Corporation for A Custom Toll Milling Agreement
Feb 21 17
Lode-Star Mining Inc. announced the signing of a letter of intent with Scorpio Gold, Corporation to provide custom milling of Lode-Star Mining Inc.'s mineralized material. This toll milling agreement, when finalized and contingent on permitting, would allow for Lode-Star material from the Goldfield Bonanza property to be processed through Scorpio's Goldwedge property located 75 miles north of Goldfield in Manhattan, Nevada. The Goldwedge mill is a fully permitted, 400 tpd facility with an associated gravity recovery circuit. Scorpio has received approval under their permits to test and process ore from other facilities. Upon Lode-Star's completion of required permitting activities with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation, a small bulk sample test will provide the baselines for metallurgical recoveries and mill throughput. The coarse gold component of Lode-Star's material will be recovered by the gravity circuit. Further testing will be conducted on the tailings to determine the economics of shipping tailings to Scorpio's Mineral Ridge heap leach property for final recovery of cyanide leachable precious metals. Mineral Ridge has also indicated it can provide assaying services to Lode-Star. The Custom Milling Agreement requires completion of a cost analysis and other operational details which are expected to be concluded upon completion of the testing. The parties believe this pairing can be mutually economical and operationally beneficial for its operations. Under the terms of the agreement and including any test sampling, Lode-Star will have to receive the necessary NDEP authorizations for initial testing and subsequent mining.

Lode-Star Mining Inc. 2016 Progress


CYPRESS, TX / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2016 / Lode-Star Mining Inc. (OTCQB: LSMG) continues progress under its '2016 Go Forward Project' with the project's goal of commencing mining operations in late 2016. Continuing what has been a 15 year, $5,000,000 process, the '2016 Go Forward Project' phases prior to mining operations include: permit submission & approval, property preparation, and financing."The Company's progress in the permitting process is proceeding according to plan, with a Q&A session with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) in December 2015 yielding positive feedback. NDEP has endorsed, in principle, the Company's desire to store its waste rock underground and if the waste rock is needed to be brought to the surface we may backfill and remediate our historic abandoned mine shafts. This will save the company the significant time and expense of having to build a surface waste facility. Our next scheduled meeting is planned for early March 2016. We continue to work towards permit submission by mid 2016," said Thomas Temkin, the Company's Chief Geologist.As the Company enters the financing phase of our '2016 Go Forward Project', it's important to note the foundational aspects of the Company's 2015 accomplishments:- The Company acquired an interest in the Goldfield Bonaza property from Lode-Star Gold, Inc. on December 11, 2014.- December 2014 through January 2015, the company made management changes to Mark Walmesley as the Company's Chairman & CEO, and Thomas Temkin as Chief Geologist, COO, and Director.- Beginning 2015 the Company, for a period of 6 months, contracted the services of Dan Capparelli for guidance for development of its business and mine plan for the Red Hills and Church high-grade vein zones.- In April the Company contracted Rubicon Environmental to lead its Permitting program.- During August 2015, Management engaged Hydrogeologica for hydrology and Tierra Group for engineering thus rounding out its permitting team.- Management completes corporate governance changes by December 2015, including DTCC eligibility submission, PCAOB auditor change, relocation of its principle office to Cypress, TX, filing of all delinquent U.S. tax returns, and filing of all Canadian tax returns.- In December 2015 the Company began preliminary talks with Nevada Department of Environmental Protection.- In December 2015 the Company engaged McClelland Labs to perform its Metallurgy. This is now completed, indicating an 85% recovery rate from conventional milling.For completion in 2016's first quarter:- Second meeting with NDEP to establish water monitoring well locations.- Commence drilling of water monitoring holes.- Establishing its toll milling circuit.About Lode-Star Mining Inc.Lode-Star Mining Inc., traded on the OTC Markets' OTCQB marketplace under the symbol (LSMG:OTCQB), is a U.S. based junior-tier mining company focused on the exploration, development, and production of North American mineral assets.LSMG is the operator of the Goldfield Bonanza property, acquired under an option for development on December 11, 2014 from Lode-Star Gold, Inc., a private Nevada corporation.
