About Us


Luminus Management is an investment management firm founded in 2002 with offices in New York, NY and Houston, TX. The firm focuses on a long/short strategy that seeks to capitalize on investment opportunities across the capital structure of companies primarily in power, utility and related subsectors by taking positions in securities including, but not limited to, equities, bonds, convertibles, preferred securities, and bank debt.
Luminus Management sees ongoing investment opportunities resulting from the inefficient and complex nature of the power sector. The firm is uniquely positioned to focus on these opportunities given its experience and ability to identify and analyze complex industry situations, securities, and project-based credits. Investment decisions are based primarily on fundamental investment research with a macro sector overlay.
Current assets are in excess of $2 billion, of which there is a significant investment by principals of Luminus Management.

 Educational Background



BBA in Finance & Economics 


Pace University - New York

                  Since 1906, Pace University has produced thinking professionals by providing high-quality education for the professions with a firm base in liberal learning amid the advantages of the New York Metropolitan Area. A private university, Pace has campuses in New York City and Westchester County, enrolling almost 13,000 students in bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs in its College of Health Professions, Dyson College of Arts and Sciences, Lubin School of Business, School of Education, School of Law, and Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems. Pace is a University whose resources have played an essential role in the realization of individual dreams of achievement, and whose mission is voiced in the motto: Opportunitas.

Pace Institute began its transformation after World War II into a modern university with emphasis on the liberal arts and sciences. With dynamic leadership and fiscally sound management, Pace grew from rented facilities and few resources into one of the largest universities in New York State, with a multimillion dollar physical plant, an endowment of nearly $100 million and a reputation for excellent teaching and talented, ambitious graduates. 

At the heart of Pace’s academic values is a historic commitment to excellence in teaching, as manifested by small classes, an emphasis on skill development and critical thinking, special tutoring and support services, and academic advising. Academic experiences at Pace emphasize teaching from both a practical and theoretical perspective, drawing on the expertise of full-time and adjunct faculty members who balance academic preparation with professional experience to bring a unique dynamic to the classroom.

The University supports and encourages scholarly activity among its intellectually vital faculty. Much of the work has professional application, and Pace particularly invites scholarship that directly relates to the classroom experience and involves students in the research process. Additionally, Pace has recognized the importance of educating students with a global perspective; Pace is building an increasing array of study abroad options, a successful mentoring program that has produced 37 Fulbright scholars since 2002, and a focus on international recruitment.

Pace University in the 21st century is shaped by its enduring traditions of opportunity and innovation. More than 100 years after its founding, the University continues its commitment to providing access to a diverse population while innovating to meet the needs of the global economy.

LEGEND AIRBRUSH SYSTEMS
Get a flawless, camera-ready look in minutes!
The global leader in airbrush technology brings you the Legend Airbrush Makeup System – your secret weapon for complexion perfection. 
Effortlessly achieve professional quality results at home with this compact, age-defying airbrush cosmetics system. The Legend has a whisper quiet motor, continuous airflow and a patented stylus that delivers a micro-fine mist of tiny pixels, transforming your skin from lackluster to luminous. 
The Legend effortlessly eliminates wrinkles, evens skin tone and smooths texture for a youthful, flawless finish that looks and feels as natural as bare skin.
Luminess Airbrush Foundations deliver high-impact pigments in feather-light, buildable formulas that allow your skin to breathe. With just one airbrush application, fine lines blur, imperfections disappear and pores are minimized, letting your natural luminosity shine through. Due to its superior blend-ability, our entire line easily transitions from sheer to complete coverage without ever looking thick or cakey. Our airbrush cosmetics are perfect for all skin types and provide exceptionally rich dimension and seamless coverage in a range of skin-matching shades.
The Legend is dermatologist tested and recommended. Airbrushing helps eliminate cross- contamination, resulting in healthier, fresher skin. Along with our revolutionary line of foundations, the Legend can be used for easy, quick and long-lasting applications of concealer, primer, moisturizer, blush, eye shadow, bronzer, skincare rejuvenation products and much more.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
