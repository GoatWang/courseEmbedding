Ellyn J. Shook
Chief Leadership & Human Resources officer
CONNECT WITH ME



































Ellyn Shook is Accenture’s chief leadership & human resources officer, responsible for helping the 411,000 people of Accenture succeed both professionally and personally. Her global team of HR experts is re-imagining leadership and talent practices to create the most truly human work environment in the digital age, fueling Accenture’s differentiation in the market and ability to improve the way the world works and lives.
Ms. Shook is a member of Accenture’s Global Management Committee. She is a strong advocate for inclusion and diversity, and Accenture has been widely recognized externally as an employer of choice and for its diversity efforts.
Before being named chief human resources officer in 2014, Ms. Shook was senior managing director—Human Resources, and led Accenture’s Human Resources Centers of Expertise and the Human Resources Business Partner Organization. In this position, she was responsible for the design of Accenture’s talent architecture, as well as the company’s total rewards, talent supply chain and talent development programs.
Between 2004 and 2011, Ms. Shook was the global human resources lead for career and performance management, total rewards, employee engagement, and mergers and acquisitions. Earlier in her career, she was head of global compensation, responsible for designing and implementing new executive compensation and equity programs—including equity grants at the time of the company’s IPO in 2001. She also led human resources for the company’s New York office for five years.
Ms. Shook serves on the board of trustees at Harvey Mudd College, the Women's Leadership Board of the Women and Public Policy program at Harvard's Kennedy School, and the steering committee of Paradigm for Parity. She is active in Women in America and Ellevate Women’s Network, and is also a member of the HR50 division of World50. A 2015 article in Forbes.com named Ms. Shook one of the top 10 CHROs.
Ms. Shook joined Accenture in 1988 and became a partner in 2003. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Purdue University.

Accenture










 


Shook, 50, joined Accenture in 1988 (view her company bio here). She already heads Accenture's global HR strategies and programs and has responsibility for the company's talent strategy, including career and performance management, employee engagement, retention and total rewards, according to a news release.

She'll now join the company's global management committee, which includes CEO Pierre Nanterme, Chief Financial Officer David Rowland, Chief Operating Officer Joe Deblaere and other C-suite executives. Shook will stay in the Minneapolis office.
Nanterme said in a statement that Shook “has distinguished herself in a number of leadership positions within human resources over her 25-year career, and has played a key role in nearly every major transformation we have made as a company, including designing and implementing our executive compensation strategies and equity programs."
Shook is also on the Women in Business advisory board at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, and serve on Junior Achievement of the Upper Midwest's board of directors executive committee.
Accenture had about 1,100 consultants in the Twin Cities metro and 220,000 worldwide in July 2013, according to Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal research. The total metro employee count as of the end of August was 1,500, Accenture said.

            Ellyn Shook on Learning from Diversity
        

                
                
                
                By: Accenture Recruitment



Accenture CHRO Ellyn Shook recently co-authored a blog post with Daniella Patrick, product manager at Accenture’s Talent Innovation Lab, highlighting the value of a “What can I learn/What can I teach?” philosophy.  Ellyn’s advice: “Take the time to learn more about each other as individuals instead of putting people in a box.”  
Ellyn explained how we can all learn from embracing diversity, and highlighted the upcoming Hackfest, that Accenture and LinkedIn are sponsoring in Bangalore, India on 24 – 25 September. There, students will innovate solutions that elevate human performance at work.  Check out Ellyn and Daniella’s full post to hear what they each learned from the other, and stay tuned for more information from Ellyn as she attends Hackfest 2016.
