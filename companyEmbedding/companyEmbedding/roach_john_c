After a roach infestation, you will most likely notice skin irritations, rashes, and cockroach bites making you feel self conscious when in public. Even worse, restless nights and insomnia which now affects your personal life, causing anxiousness and nervousness.

While you may see one or two roaches or other insects. Your family and children will feel them the worse. The roaches migrate to food, counter tops, eating areas and can transport disease.


Being Forced To Evacuate


Insomnia and Feeling Self Conscious


When the infestation is left untreated, you will be told to throw away all your valuables, your clothes, countertops, furniture, bedding, etc. Then after all this, you would be asked to politely evacuate and you or a company would use toxic pesticides having you, your family, and your pets feeling homeless for at least 4 weeks.

Top Product of 2014 for Green Pest Control









by Senam – Amazon Review


Below Are Only A Few 5 Star Reviews We Received From
Amazon, Ebay Sears, MyCleaningProducts.com and our other retailers.


by Barb Kelly – Amazon Review


Worked very well. Have not seen a live roach and has been two weeks since I sprayed. Thanks Roach Bully!








I bought this because we had a roach problem. It has a slight odor that smells pleasant. It doesn't give me an asthma attack the way that poisons do. It takes a little longer for the bugs to die, but they do die. I have used it on ants and spiders also.


I recently had a roaches outbreak, and I would see them even in the middle of the day. After I got this item, I sprayed it all over my house, (everywhere) and let it dry for a few minutes (or hours) and then went to bed: I did not see one roach!

After I washed my older blanket -which I thought the roaches were hiding in- I sprayed it silly, as well, and went to sleep soundly. Those roaches have not come back yet.

This product works!! The roaches might simply be hiding for now, I’m not sure, but I intend to spray my entire bed room soon, to make sure they never show their ugly bug faces again. This was a good expense.


We were scared out of our wits with roaches when I notice a roach crawling on my child. I found you guys from a friend and want to thank you. Roach Bully is a great product and worked as promised. No more  roaches. You have saved me a ton of worry. Thank you.


A Must If You Have A Roach Problem!








We recently had roaches in my apartment building. They did not hire an exterminator right away. I purchased this product and sprayed the area in the doorway to my apartment because I did not want the roaches coming into my apartment. I also sprayed the areas under my bathroom and kitchen sinks. I believe that this product helped a lot.

I have not seen any roach in my apartment and I hope I never do.


Great Stuff!

- Stephanie - Amazon Review


This has been used on two occasions in the past three years due to apartment roach infestations. It has been effective both times. The smell is there, but not unpleasant. We have a house cat and the product has been harmless, as described, to her. This product is a very “green” product and I highly recommend this over any type of chemical infestation treatment that may be out there. Shipping was great as well as packaging.


Bully Those Roaches


Bully Those Roaches!








by Gentle Deer Lion Tamer– Amazon Review


I had Roach Bully sent to my son who is living in Harlem. He had roaches all over the house. I sent him detailed instructions on how to use it with DE. Needless to say, the kid did not follow my instructions and just sprayed it around and sprinkled the DE into the carpet where he sleeps!

Thankfully it WORKED!

He sleeps on the floor on an air mattress and this stuff works! The roaches have disappeared and his spirits are better.

He thinks I’m joking when I told him that when he comes home he’s coming in the back door naked while I take his stuff to the laundromat ha ha!


Roach Bully has been a Top Green Product with large pest control companies, hotels and health facilities, farms, and animal clinics. Since it’s public release we have already received great feedback from our customers in helping them get rid of their roach problem.

Your Roach Extermination Center: Roach Control Products, Cockroach Killer and Roach Killer Pest Control Products

Roach control requires using the right professional products. We are the largest do-it-yourself pest control supplier of professional grade roach control products and supplies in the United States. Using roach bait is generally the preferred method of treatment, especially for indoor roach control. However, a combination of roach control products including using roach spray around the exterior of the home will ensure that roaches don't come in.
Our professional roach control products are the same professional roach products that are used by pest control companies.  When you need cockroach control products and roach killer spray fast, you can depend on DoMyOwnPestControl.com for Fast, Free shipping and expert advice. 
Our kitchens are warm, have food and water sources. They are natural places for some pests to thrive. The most problematic kitchen pests are cockroaches--unsavory creatures that disgust nearly everyone.
Many people mistakenly believe that only "dirty" people get cockroaches, but this is a myth. Every home or commercial kitchen has the potential to have a cockroach problem.
Once a cockroach infestation gets started, its severity is usually determined by the resources available for cockroach survival--food, water and harborage (i.e., hiding places). The biggest cockroach problems are often in homes where there is a clutter problem because the more stuff people have, especially in the kitchen, the more hiding places for roaches. But, clean, neat and tidy kitchens can still have roaches. For example, cockroaches can hide underneath the labels of canned goods and eat the paste off the labels.
Because cockroaches tend to frequent garbage cans, sewers and other disease-laden locations, germs attach to their body that can transfer to food contact surfaces (utensils, plates) during the normal course of roach activities. These include disease-causing bacteria: Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Streptococcus (pneumonia), several helminths (hookwoorm, pinworms, tapeworms), and even viruses (poliomyelitis). If this hasn't convinced you they are bad to live with, cockroaches also produce a powerful allergen that causes allergies and asthma.
The biggest problem in U.S. kitchens is the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. It is a small cockroach, with two distinctive longitudinal es just behind its head. The German cockroach requires moisture regularly, has a high reproductive rate and is small enough to live in small cracks and crevices. Infestations are often at their worst in the late summer months.
How to Control Roaches:
STEP 1: Ensure you are practicing proper sanitation techniques in your home
• Never leave sources of food or water exposed. Clean up spills immediately. Do not leave pet water and food out 24 hours a day. During the daytime, you can place your pet’s dish in a plate filled with soapy water. Because soap has some insecticidal properties, roaches venturing into the water will be killed.
• Keep food in tightly sealed plastic or glass containers, rather than in paper or cardboard containers that the roaches can chew through.
• Regularly clean around and beneath appliances, sinks and other locations close to a food source where dark and/or humid conditions exist. A layer of accumulated grease behind a stove will allow several adult roaches to survive and reproduce. Empty drainage pans under refrigerators to eliminate this source of water for the roaches.
• Clean the kitchen thoroughly every day.
• Store garbage in sealed plastic containers and dispose of it daily.
• Do not allow dirty dishes to accumulate, especially overnight. If you do not have the time to wash them immediately, immerse them in a strong solution of detergent and water.
• Vacuum your home regularly to help remove food particles and insect egg masses.
• Wrap or insulate pipes that have excessive amounts of condensation, repair leaky faucets and pipes, ventilate rooms and dehumidify areas of excess moisture to reduce availability of water from these sources. Controlling humidity and increasing the light and air circulation in problem areas will help control infestations.

STEP 2: Use the Right Professional Products
The standard method of treating for cockroaches has been to spray insecticides on baseboards and in cupboards, with the hope that cockroaches will crawl across the band of dried insecticide and the residue left from the application will . We now know that this type of treatment is not very effective. Reasons why include:

• Cockroaches do not live behind baseboards, but live in dark, damp locations near food and water sources. Efforts to locate and treat these hiding places are much more effective.
• Insecticides are not 100 percent effective and, unless efforts are made to reduce food, water and harborage, populations of the prolific German cockroach are likely to rebound.
• Cockroaches species, including the German cockroach, have developed insecticidal resistance to many insecticides.
• Most insecticidal sprays, especially aerosol treatments, don't have much residual activity. This is also true of "bomb" type applications.

It is possible to eradicate cockroaches, but effort and persistence must be greater than their reproductive rate. To be successful, a multi-tactic approach must be used. This means not relying on a single strategy (like sprays), but using several types of control tactics.
• Sanitation efforts alone (eliminating food, water, harborage) may not be enough to eliminate a cockroach problem, but will reduce the population and make other control efforts work better. Getting rid of clutter is extremely important. Eliminating water and food will make roaches move farther to obtain them and come into contact with baits and other control tactics.
• Cleaning cupboards and under/around appliances is important. Keep a vacuum cleaner handy. Vacuuming roaches is an easy way to make a dent in the population. Just be sure to take the vacuum cleaner bag outside afterwards.
• Because roaches usually travel pretty close to where they hide, use sticky traps (glue boards) to see where roaches are hiding. Replace them when the surface is covered with roaches. Over time, glue boards will indicate how well controls are working and identify new infestations.
The biggest improvement in controlling cockroaches in recent years is the availability of effective bait products. They are available in small plastic containers (bait stations) or as a dispensable gel. Baits use fipronil, hydamethylnon, boric acid or abamectin as their active ingredient. Use gel baits (best) or bait stations in areas where roaches are caught on sticky traps. Bait areas where roach specks are found—these are locations where roaches spend a lot of time.

Other low toxic approaches include:
• Use boric acid dusts in wall voids or under appliances. When used alone, Boric acid isn't terribly effective, but a good supplementary treatment. When roaches walk through the dust it sticks to their body. They ingest it as they groom themselves and it is a slow-acting stomach poison.
• Dusts of silica dioxide or diatomaceous earth kill roaches by abrading their waxy cuticle and desiccating them. Use these in wall voids.
• Use cold or hot temperatures to kill roaches. If roaches get into electronic appliances, bag them and put them in the freezer overnight.

How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor
