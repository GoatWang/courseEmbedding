Product Reviews



   In Level 1, four grids containing random patterns of colored squares are displayed on the screen.  Three patterns are identical, one is different.  The patient must determine which pattern is different.  Response times are also timed and scored.As skill is gained, the patient progresses to Timed Squares.  In this procedure, time can be set from the Options Menu.  Four different colored grids are then presented.  The patient must choose which grid matches the original flashed grid.  Grid Size can be varied from 1 x 2 to 5 x 5.  Or make a game of it and start with a 1 x 2 grid and with every 5 correct answers the grid size will increase!Squares was designed to be used in conjunction with Bernell's Visual Discrimination (VTVDM) and Memory (VTVDM2) work books.

Gary Vogel joined Drummond Woodsum in February 2008 after practicing for more than 20 years at two prominent Portland, Maine law firms. Gary brings substantial experience representing businesses, individuals, banks, investors and developers in corporate and commercial transactions, commercial real estate matters, financing transactions, business acquisitions and sales and business formation and governance. His clients include manufacturing and service companies, banks operating throughout the state of Maine and beyond, out of state lenders involved in transactions in Maine, real estate developers and investors and non-profit organizations. Gary also represents developers and lenders in affordable housing transactions, and has substantial experience working with state and federal housing finance agencies including Maine State Housing Authority, HUD, and the US Department of Agriculture's Rural Development agency in a variety of programs including the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit, the Section 8 Program and various guaranteed loan programs for private, public housing and non-profit developers.
Recent transactions include the sale of stock of established Maine companies to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) as a way to provide an exit strategy for existing owners, while transitioning to employee ownership; restructuring of a group of related Maine companies into a holding company and subsidiary structure, in a tax free transaction; representation of a developer of a senior independent and assisted living community in partnership with a hospital organization; representation of a lead bank in a participation transaction among a group of five banks; sales of Maine businesses to public companies; representation of a minority shareholder in the buyout of his shares in three related companies; representation of the developer of a new 20-unit condominium project and numerous commercial financing transactions, including substantial construction loan transactions involving both commercial development and affordable housing projects utilizing the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit.
Gary is listed in the 2013 Edition of Best Lawyers in America in the categories of Real Estate, Banking and Finance Law, and Corporate Law. He has been a frequent presenter at continuing professional education conferences involving the use of Maine LLCs and corporations, the purchase and sale of businesses as well as commercial real estate financing transactions. Gary's clients look to him to provide creative counsel to help them grow, whether they are start-up organizations, organizations seeking capital to help them grow, or organizations developing succession plans and exit strategies for current ownership.
