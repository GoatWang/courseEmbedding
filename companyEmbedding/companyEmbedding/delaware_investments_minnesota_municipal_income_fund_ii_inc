    Municipal Income Funds: State tax information


For the calendar year 2016, income dividends received from investments in the funds listed in the table below were primarily exempt from federal income tax. Dividends that are exempt from federal income tax may or may not be exempt from tax under the laws of a particular state or local taxing authority. Generally, however, income from bonds issued by municipalities in a particular state is not taxable in that state. Most states do not grant tax-free treatment to interest from municipal securities of other states. We recommend that you consult your tax advisor in this regard.


Listed here, on a state-by-state basis, are the percentages of interest income earned on municipal obligations of issuers in each such state during the calendar year 2016.


A note about AMT


A portion of the income paid to the Delaware Investments Closed-end Municipal Income Funds shareholders may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT). See Municipal Income Funds: Percentage of interest income subject to AMT.
