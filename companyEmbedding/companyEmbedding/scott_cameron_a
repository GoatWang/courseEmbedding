Upcoming Public Hearings in Pending Cases


 

On this page:
Overview
Hearings by product or service
Hearing details (in alphabetical order by defendant name)
Overview
Under the law, victims of Federal crimes such as antitrust violations are entitled to certain rights. These rights include the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime; the right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding; and the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding.
This page lists named defendants (and products or industries involved) in pending cases prosecuted by the Antitrust Division for which public court proceedings are scheduled and for which the court has approved victim notification through this webpage.
Note: Hearing dates and times are subject to last-minute change. Although every effort has been made to provide current information, before attending a hearing you may wish to phone the court directly to confirm.

Don T. "Scotty" Cameron (born November 8, 1962) is an American golf club maker primarily known for making putters for the Acushnet Company, which operates the Titleist brand of golf balls and clubs. The Scotty Cameron putter brand has been part of Titleist since 1994.
Cameron was born in Glendale, California. He later moved to Fountain Valley where he grew up, attending high school in nearby Huntington Beach Edison High School. He now lives in Carlsbad, California with his wife and two daughters.
In 1991, Cameron designed and manufactured putters and worked directly with select golf equipment manufacturers, including Maxfli, Cleveland and the Ray Cook Golf Company. During this year, he manufactured his first retail production putter, nicknamed the Fry's Pity Putter.[1] Later that year, Cameron began producing putters exclusively for Mizuno.
In late 1992, Cameron and his wife, Kathy, set up Cameron Golf International and began selling the Scotty Cameron Classic line of putters. In 1993, Bernhard Langer won the Masters Tournament using a Cameron[2] prototype putter. Langer's Masters Tournament win helped to jumpstart the Camerons' new company.
In August 1994, Titleist fought off competition from five other companies to contract with Cameron to make putters exclusively for the Acushnet Company.[2] Since then, the Scotty Cameron brand has grown to be one of the leading names in golf.[3]
In 1996, the first Scotty Cameron Putter Studio was established in San Diego’s North County where the top players in the world would come to analyze and understand their putting strokes and have custom putters created by Scotty.
In 2004, the Acushnet Company expanded the Putter Studio’s square footage and capabilities. Cameron and his team moved to a new research and development facility built from the ground up. Additionally, the Putter Studio houses the Custom Shop, where anyone can prepare an order online and send a Scotty Cameron putter for restoration and/or customization.
In 2007, the Scotty Cameron Museum & Gallery was opened in Japan near Tokyo. It houses many one-of-a-kind Scotty Cameron products, putters and prototypes, including many personal artifacts.
On May 20, 2011 - Fortune Brands, Inc. announced an agreement for the sale of its Acushnet Company golf business, including the Scotty Cameron brand, to a group led by Fila Korea Ltd., for $1.225 billion in cash.[4][unreliable source?] According to Gene Yoon, chairman of Fila Korea, the acquisition provides them with well-known brands to sell in emerging markets in Asia.[5]
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery California
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery, a place for golfers to experience the Art of Putting, the same methodology and technology used by Scotty Cameron in fitting the best players in the world, opened its doors on July 9, 2014, just north of San Diego.
The Gallery, located off Highway 101 in the quaint Southern California beach town of Encinitas, Calif., is described as “part retail space, part high-end product gallery, 100-percent putter fitting facility.” It’s an extension of Scotty’s state-of-the-art research and development facility in nearby North County San Diego – the Scotty Cameron Putter Studio – where Tour players from around the world visit regularly to get fit by Scotty and his team. At the Gallery, golfers will experience the same Tour treatment, gaining the knowledge provided by Cameron’s proprietary high-speed video putting stroke analysis tools, as well as the expertise of his highly trained fitters.
Cameron enthusiasts can also view and purchase an ever-changing array of rare Scotty Cameron Tour putters and one-off creations found only at the Gallery. Luxury apparel personally selected by Cameron, and other items he finds intriguing are also available.
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo
In May 2016, Scotty Cameron opened the doors to the Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo in the chic shopping district of Aoyama. Located on the third floor of the Jewels of Aoyama building, visitors are presented with an elegant boutique experience that mirrors the essence of Scotty's brand.
Similar to the California Gallery, the Tokyo Gallery houses limited and unique Cameron Creations, apparel and never-seen-before Tour putters crafted for discerning players and connoisseurs. Additionally, a fitting studio opened in the summer of 2016 presents players with the same Tour-quality putter fitting experience offered in his California Putter Studio and Gallery.

Tiger Woods using Scotty Cameron putters[edit]
Tiger Woods used a Scotty Cameron for the majority of his career and during 13 of his 14 major championships (he used a different Scotty Cameron putter in his 1997 Masters victory). It is made of 303 German Stainless Steel. It has a single sight dot and a red "cherry dot" on both the face and in the back cavity. The putter also has a blank sole and has "Tiger" on the left bumper and "Woods" on the right bumper. Tiger uses a Ping grip on his putter. Woods had used a Scotty Cameron putter for all of his professional golf victories up to December 2011. His most used Scotty Cameron putter was first put into play in July 1998.
In 2010, Woods switched from the putter he had been using since 1999 to a Nike Method 001 putter.[6] This change was not without controversy and Woods spent almost a year experimenting with different Nike models before settling on a configuration he liked.
In 2016, at the Hero World Challenge, Tiger went back to his Scotty Cameron putter after not playing a tournament in 16 months. Tiger said the putter went back in his bag the day after Nike announced their exit from the golf equipment business. It is the same putter that he used to win 13 of his 14 majors.[7]
Major victories[edit]
A number of other professional golfers use Scotty Camerons including those that are on staff of many other major golf companies (Nike, Taylormade, Callaway, etc.). Since 1993, more than 500 worldwide tournaments and about 1/3 (Tiger Woods has won almost 1/2 of these with his Scotty Cameron putter) of the four majors have been won by a player using a Scotty Cameron putter. In 1996, The Scotty Cameron brand won its first putter count on Tour via the Darrell Survey.[citation needed] Scotty Cameron putters rank second in wins in the modern era, behind Ping.[8]

Major victories[edit]
A number of other professional golfers use Scotty Camerons including those that are on staff of many other major golf companies (Nike, Taylormade, Callaway, etc.). Since 1993, more than 500 worldwide tournaments and about 1/3 (Tiger Woods has won almost 1/2 of these with his Scotty Cameron putter) of the four majors have been won by a player using a Scotty Cameron putter. In 1996, The Scotty Cameron brand won its first putter count on Tour via the Darrell Survey.[citation needed] Scotty Cameron putters rank second in wins in the modern era, behind Ping.[8]

Don T. "Scotty" Cameron (born November 8, 1962) is an American golf club maker primarily known for making putters for the Acushnet Company, which operates the Titleist brand of golf balls and clubs. The Scotty Cameron putter brand has been part of Titleist since 1994.
Cameron was born in Glendale, California. He later moved to Fountain Valley where he grew up, attending high school in nearby Huntington Beach Edison High School. He now lives in Carlsbad, California with his wife and two daughters.
In 1991, Cameron designed and manufactured putters and worked directly with select golf equipment manufacturers, including Maxfli, Cleveland and the Ray Cook Golf Company. During this year, he manufactured his first retail production putter, nicknamed the Fry's Pity Putter.[1] Later that year, Cameron began producing putters exclusively for Mizuno.
In late 1992, Cameron and his wife, Kathy, set up Cameron Golf International and began selling the Scotty Cameron Classic line of putters. In 1993, Bernhard Langer won the Masters Tournament using a Cameron[2] prototype putter. Langer's Masters Tournament win helped to jumpstart the Camerons' new company.
In August 1994, Titleist fought off competition from five other companies to contract with Cameron to make putters exclusively for the Acushnet Company.[2] Since then, the Scotty Cameron brand has grown to be one of the leading names in golf.[3]
In 1996, the first Scotty Cameron Putter Studio was established in San Diego’s North County where the top players in the world would come to analyze and understand their putting strokes and have custom putters created by Scotty.
In 2004, the Acushnet Company expanded the Putter Studio’s square footage and capabilities. Cameron and his team moved to a new research and development facility built from the ground up. Additionally, the Putter Studio houses the Custom Shop, where anyone can prepare an order online and send a Scotty Cameron putter for restoration and/or customization.
In 2007, the Scotty Cameron Museum & Gallery was opened in Japan near Tokyo. It houses many one-of-a-kind Scotty Cameron products, putters and prototypes, including many personal artifacts.
On May 20, 2011 - Fortune Brands, Inc. announced an agreement for the sale of its Acushnet Company golf business, including the Scotty Cameron brand, to a group led by Fila Korea Ltd., for $1.225 billion in cash.[4][unreliable source?] According to Gene Yoon, chairman of Fila Korea, the acquisition provides them with well-known brands to sell in emerging markets in Asia.[5]
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery California
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery, a place for golfers to experience the Art of Putting, the same methodology and technology used by Scotty Cameron in fitting the best players in the world, opened its doors on July 9, 2014, just north of San Diego.
The Gallery, located off Highway 101 in the quaint Southern California beach town of Encinitas, Calif., is described as “part retail space, part high-end product gallery, 100-percent putter fitting facility.” It’s an extension of Scotty’s state-of-the-art research and development facility in nearby North County San Diego – the Scotty Cameron Putter Studio – where Tour players from around the world visit regularly to get fit by Scotty and his team. At the Gallery, golfers will experience the same Tour treatment, gaining the knowledge provided by Cameron’s proprietary high-speed video putting stroke analysis tools, as well as the expertise of his highly trained fitters.
Cameron enthusiasts can also view and purchase an ever-changing array of rare Scotty Cameron Tour putters and one-off creations found only at the Gallery. Luxury apparel personally selected by Cameron, and other items he finds intriguing are also available.
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo
In May 2016, Scotty Cameron opened the doors to the Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo in the chic shopping district of Aoyama. Located on the third floor of the Jewels of Aoyama building, visitors are presented with an elegant boutique experience that mirrors the essence of Scotty's brand.
Similar to the California Gallery, the Tokyo Gallery houses limited and unique Cameron Creations, apparel and never-seen-before Tour putters crafted for discerning players and connoisseurs. Additionally, a fitting studio opened in the summer of 2016 presents players with the same Tour-quality putter fitting experience offered in his California Putter Studio and Gallery.

Tiger Woods using Scotty Cameron putters[edit]
Tiger Woods used a Scotty Cameron for the majority of his career and during 13 of his 14 major championships (he used a different Scotty Cameron putter in his 1997 Masters victory). It is made of 303 German Stainless Steel. It has a single sight dot and a red "cherry dot" on both the face and in the back cavity. The putter also has a blank sole and has "Tiger" on the left bumper and "Woods" on the right bumper. Tiger uses a Ping grip on his putter. Woods had used a Scotty Cameron putter for all of his professional golf victories up to December 2011. His most used Scotty Cameron putter was first put into play in July 1998.
In 2010, Woods switched from the putter he had been using since 1999 to a Nike Method 001 putter.[6] This change was not without controversy and Woods spent almost a year experimenting with different Nike models before settling on a configuration he liked.
In 2016, at the Hero World Challenge, Tiger went back to his Scotty Cameron putter after not playing a tournament in 16 months. Tiger said the putter went back in his bag the day after Nike announced their exit from the golf equipment business. It is the same putter that he used to win 13 of his 14 majors.[7]
Major victories[edit]
A number of other professional golfers use Scotty Camerons including those that are on staff of many other major golf companies (Nike, Taylormade, Callaway, etc.). Since 1993, more than 500 worldwide tournaments and about 1/3 (Tiger Woods has won almost 1/2 of these with his Scotty Cameron putter) of the four majors have been won by a player using a Scotty Cameron putter. In 1996, The Scotty Cameron brand won its first putter count on Tour via the Darrell Survey.[citation needed] Scotty Cameron putters rank second in wins in the modern era, behind Ping.[8]

Don T. "Scotty" Cameron (born November 8, 1962) is an American golf club maker primarily known for making putters for the Acushnet Company, which operates the Titleist brand of golf balls and clubs. The Scotty Cameron putter brand has been part of Titleist since 1994.
Cameron was born in Glendale, California. He later moved to Fountain Valley where he grew up, attending high school in nearby Huntington Beach Edison High School. He now lives in Carlsbad, California with his wife and two daughters.
In 1991, Cameron designed and manufactured putters and worked directly with select golf equipment manufacturers, including Maxfli, Cleveland and the Ray Cook Golf Company. During this year, he manufactured his first retail production putter, nicknamed the Fry's Pity Putter.[1] Later that year, Cameron began producing putters exclusively for Mizuno.
In late 1992, Cameron and his wife, Kathy, set up Cameron Golf International and began selling the Scotty Cameron Classic line of putters. In 1993, Bernhard Langer won the Masters Tournament using a Cameron[2] prototype putter. Langer's Masters Tournament win helped to jumpstart the Camerons' new company.
In August 1994, Titleist fought off competition from five other companies to contract with Cameron to make putters exclusively for the Acushnet Company.[2] Since then, the Scotty Cameron brand has grown to be one of the leading names in golf.[3]
In 1996, the first Scotty Cameron Putter Studio was established in San Diego’s North County where the top players in the world would come to analyze and understand their putting strokes and have custom putters created by Scotty.
In 2004, the Acushnet Company expanded the Putter Studio’s square footage and capabilities. Cameron and his team moved to a new research and development facility built from the ground up. Additionally, the Putter Studio houses the Custom Shop, where anyone can prepare an order online and send a Scotty Cameron putter for restoration and/or customization.
In 2007, the Scotty Cameron Museum & Gallery was opened in Japan near Tokyo. It houses many one-of-a-kind Scotty Cameron products, putters and prototypes, including many personal artifacts.
On May 20, 2011 - Fortune Brands, Inc. announced an agreement for the sale of its Acushnet Company golf business, including the Scotty Cameron brand, to a group led by Fila Korea Ltd., for $1.225 billion in cash.[4][unreliable source?] According to Gene Yoon, chairman of Fila Korea, the acquisition provides them with well-known brands to sell in emerging markets in Asia.[5]
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery California
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery, a place for golfers to experience the Art of Putting, the same methodology and technology used by Scotty Cameron in fitting the best players in the world, opened its doors on July 9, 2014, just north of San Diego.
The Gallery, located off Highway 101 in the quaint Southern California beach town of Encinitas, Calif., is described as “part retail space, part high-end product gallery, 100-percent putter fitting facility.” It’s an extension of Scotty’s state-of-the-art research and development facility in nearby North County San Diego – the Scotty Cameron Putter Studio – where Tour players from around the world visit regularly to get fit by Scotty and his team. At the Gallery, golfers will experience the same Tour treatment, gaining the knowledge provided by Cameron’s proprietary high-speed video putting stroke analysis tools, as well as the expertise of his highly trained fitters.
Cameron enthusiasts can also view and purchase an ever-changing array of rare Scotty Cameron Tour putters and one-off creations found only at the Gallery. Luxury apparel personally selected by Cameron, and other items he finds intriguing are also available.
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo
In May 2016, Scotty Cameron opened the doors to the Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery Tokyo in the chic shopping district of Aoyama. Located on the third floor of the Jewels of Aoyama building, visitors are presented with an elegant boutique experience that mirrors the essence of Scotty's brand.
Similar to the California Gallery, the Tokyo Gallery houses limited and unique Cameron Creations, apparel and never-seen-before Tour putters crafted for discerning players and connoisseurs. Additionally, a fitting studio opened in the summer of 2016 presents players with the same Tour-quality putter fitting experience offered in his California Putter Studio and Gallery.

Tiger Woods using Scotty Cameron putters[edit]
Tiger Woods used a Scotty Cameron for the majority of his career and during 13 of his 14 major championships (he used a different Scotty Cameron putter in his 1997 Masters victory). It is made of 303 German Stainless Steel. It has a single sight dot and a red "cherry dot" on both the face and in the back cavity. The putter also has a blank sole and has "Tiger" on the left bumper and "Woods" on the right bumper. Tiger uses a Ping grip on his putter. Woods had used a Scotty Cameron putter for all of his professional golf victories up to December 2011. His most used Scotty Cameron putter was first put into play in July 1998.
In 2010, Woods switched from the putter he had been using since 1999 to a Nike Method 001 putter.[6] This change was not without controversy and Woods spent almost a year experimenting with different Nike models before settling on a configuration he liked.
In 2016, at the Hero World Challenge, Tiger went back to his Scotty Cameron putter after not playing a tournament in 16 months. Tiger said the putter went back in his bag the day after Nike announced their exit from the golf equipment business. It is the same putter that he used to win 13 of his 14 majors.[7]
Major victories[edit]
A number of other professional golfers use Scotty Camerons including those that are on staff of many other major golf companies (Nike, Taylormade, Callaway, etc.). Since 1993, more than 500 worldwide tournaments and about 1/3 (Tiger Woods has won almost 1/2 of these with his Scotty Cameron putter) of the four majors have been won by a player using a Scotty Cameron putter. In 1996, The Scotty Cameron brand won its first putter count on Tour via the Darrell Survey.[citation needed] Scotty Cameron putters rank second in wins in the modern era, behind Ping.[8]

Don T. "Scotty" Cameron (born November 8, 1962) is an American golf club maker primarily known for making putters for the Acushnet Company, which operates the Titleist brand of golf balls and clubs. The Scotty Cameron putter brand has been part of Titleist since 1994.
Cameron was born in Glendale, California. He later moved to Fountain Valley where he grew up, attending high school in nearby Huntington Beach Edison High School. He now lives in Carlsbad, California with his wife and two daughters.
In 1991, Cameron designed and manufactured putters and worked directly with select golf equipment manufacturers, including Maxfli, Cleveland and the Ray Cook Golf Company. During this year, he manufactured his first retail production putter, nicknamed the Fry's Pity Putter.[1] Later that year, Cameron began producing putters exclusively for Mizuno.
In late 1992, Cameron and his wife, Kathy, set up Cameron Golf International and began selling the Scotty Cameron Classic line of putters. In 1993, Bernhard Langer won the Masters Tournament using a Cameron[2] prototype putter. Langer's Masters Tournament win helped to jumpstart the Camerons' new company.
In August 1994, Titleist fought off competition from five other companies to contract with Cameron to make putters exclusively for the Acushnet Company.[2] Since then, the Scotty Cameron brand has grown to be one of the leading names in golf.[3]
In 1996, the first Scotty Cameron Putter Studio was established in San Diego’s North County where the top players in the world would come to analyze and understand their putting strokes and have custom putters created by Scotty.
In 2004, the Acushnet Company expanded the Putter Studio’s square footage and capabilities. Cameron and his team moved to a new research and development facility built from the ground up. Additionally, the Putter Studio houses the Custom Shop, where anyone can prepare an order online and send a Scotty Cameron putter for restoration and/or customization.
In 2007, the Scotty Cameron Museum & Gallery was opened in Japan near Tokyo. It houses many one-of-a-kind Scotty Cameron products, putters and prototypes, including many personal artifacts.
On May 20, 2011 - Fortune Brands, Inc. announced an agreement for the sale of its Acushnet Company golf business, including the Scotty Cameron brand, to a group led by Fila Korea Ltd., for $1.225 billion in cash.[4][unreliable source?] According to Gene Yoon, chairman of Fila Korea, the acquisition provides them with well-known brands to sell in emerging markets in Asia.[5]
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery California
The Scotty Cameron Golf Gallery, a place for golfers to experience the Art of Putting, the same methodology and technology used by Scotty Cameron in fitting the best players in the world, opened its doors on July 9, 2014, just north of San Diego.
The Gallery, located off Highway 101 in the quaint Southern California beach town of Encinitas, Calif., is described as “part retail space, part high-end product gallery, 100-percent putter fitting facility.” It’s an extension of Scotty’s state-of-the-art research and development facility in nearby North County San Diego – the Scotty Cameron Putter Studio – where Tour players from around the world visit regularly to get fit by Scotty and his team.

Tiger Woods using Scotty Cameron putters[edit]
Tiger Woods used a Scotty Cameron for the majority of his career and during 13 of his 14 major championships (he used a different Scotty Cameron putter in his 1997 Masters victory). It is made of 303 German Stainless Steel. It has a single sight dot and a red "cherry dot" on both the face and in the back cavity. The putter also has a blank sole and has "Tiger" on the left bumper and "Woods" on the right bumper. Tiger uses a Ping grip on his putter. Woods had used a Scotty Cameron putter for all of his professional golf victories up to December 2011. His most used Scotty Cameron putter was first put into play in July 1998.

Major victories[edit]
A number of other professional golfers use Scotty Camerons including those that are on staff of many other major golf companies (Nike, Taylormade, Callaway, etc.). Since 1993, more than 500 worldwide tournaments and about 1/3 (Tiger Woods has won almost 1/2 of these with his Scotty Cameron putter) of the four majors have been won by a player using a Scotty Cameron putter. In 1996, The Scotty Cameron brand won its first putter count on Tour via the Darrell Survey.[citation needed] Scotty Cameron putters rank second in wins in the modern era, behind Ping.[8]

Selection

Perfect Your Short Game with Scotty Cameron Putters 
Take your short game to the next level with Tour-proven Scotty Cameron putters from Titleist®. 
Named after the renowned club maker, the Titleist® Scotty Cameron putters collection includes both blade and mallet clubheads, quality crafted for excellent sound and feel on impact. Innovative sole core technology in each Scotty Cameron putter helps improve stability, precision and forgiveness on mishits. Choose from blade putters and mallet putters:

Scotty Cameron blade putters have precisely milled surfaces for remarkable feel and soft sound from deep in the mill face. Select weights in the heel and toe perfectly match the shaft length for excellent balance. 
Scotty Cameron mallet putters provide easy alignment through crisp sight lines on the clubhead, providing vertical and horizontal guidance for your stroke. An extended back with an innovative aluminum sole delivers unparalleled precision.

Each Scotty Cameron putter is made of aircraft-grade materials. Looking for something else? Find it today with the full collection of golf putters or Titleist Golf clubs at DICK’S Sporting Goods.
