Benjamin Iverson Lumpkin's Experience
Title: Vice President
               Company: Lumpkin Family Foundation
Job Details
               For many years, The Lumpkin Family Foundation's mission has read: to support education, preserve and protect the environment and foster opportunities for leadership, with special consideration for our heritage in East Central Illinois. As a foundation that relies on the support of an engaged, extended family with varied interests, the broad areas of this mission have provided a great deal of flexibility. We have made grants in each of the areas described in the Foundation's mission, for everything from capital to operating support, from bridge finance, to seed money, matching or straight grants. In recent years, our approach has evolved with the family's appreciation for the role foundations can play as conveners and connectors of people and organizations. We have expressed this through financial support to a variety of programs, but also through the creation of our own programs and participation in cross-organization collaborations. The Foundation's interest is increasingly in systems change. What does that mean? More and more, we aim to help organizations become stronger or work across boundaries in collaborations to address underlying problems facing a field or a group of people. (Some examples of recent work are noted below.) It also means investing more to help people learn and understand their work differently. Fostering leadership, we have come to understand, is accomplished in these terms. We are likely to continue moving in this direction, favoring opportunities to help systems or build movements over straight-up program or operating grants. And we most certainly will maintain our commitment to East Central Illinois (http://www.lumpkinfoundation.org/ecimap.php), despite the scattering of Lumpkin family members across the country. However, like other organizations, we will face greater financial challenges and difficult choices. Most of The Foundation's grant budgets for new grants are reduced substantially in 2009 and likely will be reduced again in 2010. It's a fact of life, even though we have increased our pay-out for 2009 from the IRS mandatory 5% to 6%. The effect of this reduction will likely be that more of our grants will occur closer to our traditional home of Coles County, and they will be more closely aligned to the mission of each of our programs. Although we will not stop capital grants altogether, they will be a lower priority, and new ones will be much smaller commitments than what might have been expected in the past.
