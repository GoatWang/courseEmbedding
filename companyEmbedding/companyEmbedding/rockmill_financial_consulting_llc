David J. Conley 
Owner  Managing Partner513.260.1495dconley@rockmillfinancial.com




David J Conley of Louisville, KY started Rockmill Financial Consulting, LLC in February of 2013.  With over 23 years of Investment Banking experience, David has worked with many clients and created Rockmill with a very precise goal: to give his clients as much, knowledge, support, and expertise that is needed for them  to succeed in their high profile and vital positions.  
In the past 5 years with challenging economic times, the needs of his clients changed and David felt even more compelled to change with his clients by providing additional services that would support them through this time. It was through his efforts while at Robert W. Baird that he created a broad array of services that not only provided financial support, but a foundation of services that covered much more. By using innovative approaches along with in-depth research, David was able to simplify, yet give his clients a thorough picture of their position within the realm of their industry.  
David lived all of his childhood in the west end of Louisville, Ky.  His mother, Gurley Mae Conley, worked at least two jobs and sometimes three, to support her two sons.  David learned bookkeeping from his mother who managed a cleaning crew at night.  Growing up with no father and living through very difficult times,  David developed a desire to become something more, not only for himself, but for his family.  
Work History
In 1982, David started at Georgetown College, a small liberal arts college in Georgetown, KY. David majored in Marketing and Finance. He also minored in Communications with a focus on theatre. He graduated in May of 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree.
In June of 1986, David started his first job at Citizens Fidelity Bank in Louisville, Kentucky. David’s work started as a bank manager in retail banking then quickly moved into commercial lending where he made small to middle market loans to commercial businesses.
In September of 1988 David was offered a position with Ameritrust Bank in Cincinnati, Ohio as the manager of a new banking office concept that combined retail and commercial banking, and personal investments into a single office. There he managed several loan officers and stock brokers.
In September 1989, David joined Seasongood & Mayer as an investment banking associate. At Seasongood, David was classically trained in State, State Agency, County, City, School District, Special District (TID’s, CFA’s SID’s), and COG finance. By the time he left Seasongood in 2005, David had managed more than 450 financings totaling in excess of $5 billion. David earned his Series 7 and Series 53.
David joined Robert W. Baird and Co., in 2006 as a managing director. David undertook an initiative to build a business platform that would place Robert W. Baird among the most recognized public finance firms in the State of Ohio. During his time at Baird, the company’s market share grew substantially. Between 2006 and 2012, Baird, ended among the top five investment banks in Ohio. Having accomplished his goals, David left Baird in January, 2013.
On a Personal Note
Many know David as their banker, advisor, or co-worker but Noahl, Amanda, and Tanner know him as “dad.”  When his children were asked how do you see him, their replies were, “strong , dedicated, good hearted, and loving person.”  His wife and best friend, Trish, describes him as one of the most giving, sensitive, and dedicated persons that she has ever met.  Last but not least, David is also known as Granpa!  Kodi Raine was born on David and Trish’s anniversary and will be turning 2 in May of 2013.  As David builds Rockmill Financial, he and Trish are also focused on family time with the children and grandchild out on their 5 acres near the original Rockmill Farm in Lancaster, Ohio.

When you have a passion for what you do, your clients can tell. When your clients can tell, they develop a passion for what you do, as well.
Loveland City SchoolsBrett Griffith, Treasurer/CFOI have worked with David Conley for the past 18 years on many financial projects and in every case the guidance given, financial information provided and his advice is second to none. I am currently working with Rockmill Financial Consulting and the level of excellence continues.
 Apollo Career CenterJudy Wells, SuperintendentThanks to the work Rockmill put into the bond rating presentation, the travel to New York and the professional coaching Apollo was upgraded to a higher rating given our financial capacity, demographics and the economic conditions in NW Ohio. They helped save our taxpayers thousands of $$ over the life of our bonds. Whenever I need encouragement I remember what we accomplished for our community, and can turn around and look at our Fantastic Four picture – which always makes me smile.
 Southern Local SchoolsRoy W. Johnson, Treasurer/CFOSouthern Local is a small rural school district in SE Ohio that recently passed a bond levy to construct state of the art facilities.  Without David's guiding hand, the task would have been much more difficult.  We have worked with David on several fronts and he treats us with respect and has our best interests in mind.
 Apollo Career CenterGreg BukowskiRockmill Financial is a great company! We are very glad we hired them. Very customer oriented, professional, and effective. Most impressive was the quality face to face time they spent with us and the board. I highly recommend David, Scott and Emily!
 Ross County Water CompanyWilliam F. Neal, General ManagerI find David and his group to be extremely loyal, dedicated to service, and highly efficient in analyzing various alternatives in decision making processes.
Most importantly I have found this group to be highly ethical, intelligent, and caring individuals.They truly understand the importance of high quality customer service.
 Shelby City SchoolsElizabeth Anatra, TreasurerWe've enjoyed working with you and your team in the past and look forward to doing so again.
 Canal Winchester Local School DistrictJoyce A. BoyerIf you need excellent, reliable information on financial borrowings, work with Rockmill Financial Consulting, LLC.  You can't go wrong in doing so.
 Northwood City School DistrictGreg Clark, SuperintendentAt Northwood Schools we found ourselves in need of updating our facilities and even with assistance from the state, a traditional bond issue approach was not really feasible. Working with David and Emily at Rockmill, we were able to really look at all of our available assets and put together a plan our community was able to support.
 Eric Soltis, CFO Pike-Delta-York Local SchoolsAfter working with David, I can confidently say that he is extremely talented and knowledgeable in the realm of finance. In addition, he is very professional and courteous, going the extra mile to break things down for me each and every step of the way. I worked with him and his team on a bond refinancing deal, which included a credit rating trip to NYC to present to Moody's, in an effort to maximize the savings to our district. In the end, we were able to surpass our initial projections because of being properly prepared. The NPV savings of over $900,000 to the district's taxpayers is something that I am extremely proud of, and the magnitude of our success is largely due to David and his expertise. I would highly recommend David and the services that he has to offer.
 Nick Roberts, CFO Licking Heights Local SchoolsIt’s reassuring knowing that we have financial experts at Rockmill Financial to offer support with complex and/or sensitive financial decisions. The associates at Rockmill Financial afford security and peace of mind that our district is complying with debt and other financing requirements.  It’s extremely beneficial to my position having financial professionals assisting in the decision making process.
 Jonette Curry, Auditor, Knox County, OhioKnox County is proud to be associated with Rockmill Financial Consulting, LLC.  We have had the pleasure of working with David for many years and his level of expertise has been so valuable to us. We would recommend David and his team for your financial needs.
 Carri Brown, County Administrator, Fairfield County, OhioDavid Conley and his team at Rockmill Financial Consulting, LLC, have provided well researched, evidence-based guidance to Fairfield County on many different projects. For example, Rockmill supported the county in preparing for bond rating presentations. Further, the firm has assisted with the creation of new ventures, such as with the establishment of a Port Authority. Rockmill’s expertise supports local governments who are working hard to provide services in the most cost effective and innovative manner. Rockmill understands and appreciates the public mission to improve the health, safety and well-being of our citizens.
 Terrah Floyd, CFO, Springboro Community City School DistrictDavid Conley, Emily Cannon & Scott Ericson are top notch. The guidance and expertise of Rockmill Financial has helped our district tremendously. As an assistant Treasurer, I worked with David for 14 years on various financial needs. Shortly after becoming a Treasurer we decided to do an energy conservation project, and I knew exactly who to call. It is really comforting knowing you have the professional guidance from true professionals who have a vast amount of knowledge in all aspects of school funding and the interworking’s. They have tremendous knowledge and made my board, Superintendent and administration feel completely comfortable with the financing of the project. As a new Treasurer, they helped the Superintendent and I prepare for our Bond Rating presentation in New York that went seamlessly. I would recommend the entire Rockmill team to anyone looking at refunding’s, debt issuance, or any financial needs. I am confident they provided us with the best results for our community.
 Chris Schornack, Director of Finance, City of PickeringtonThe services provided by Rockmill are simply unmatched. David, Emily, and Scott truly embody the characteristics of quality client service. Their dedication and attentiveness to customer needs, understanding of local governments, and their financial experience are invaluable.
