Post-Facebook, Accel Is Investing a Lot, Exiting a Bit


September 10, 2012
By Joanna Glasner





 


Sometimes it’s hard to remember that Accel Partners has done other things besides back Facebook.
The firm made so much from that one investment that limited partners in the fund that backed it stand to reap among the largest returns in venture history.  Even with Facebook’s plummeting post-IPO stock price, Accel’s 10.7% stake the company, which it secured primarily with a $12 million investment in 2006, was still worth more than $4 billion as of late last week.
But truth is, most of Accel’s limited partners won’t profit from the Facebook investment. That’s because only a handful actually invested in Accel IX, the $400 million 2004 vintage fund that backed the social network. The vast majority of the money Accel has under management comes from later vintage funds. 





So how are those funds doing? Overall, it’s too early to make any definitive judgment, as the bulk of the more than $3 billion it has under management comes from funds raised in 2008 or later, which makes for a fairly immature portfolio by venture standards. Two vehicles – the Accel Big Data Fund and Accel Growth Fund II – just closed in 2011.
Still, it’s intriguing to take a peak under the hood to see what other big hits Accel has had or stands to generate from its current portfolio.
Over the past year, at least five portfolio companies have gone public in the past year. Of those, the largest is Groupon, in which Accel has a stake of just over 5 percent. While the daily deals provider’s current market capitalization of $3 billion is way down from its peak valuation, Accel still stands to win on that one, having come in as an early stage investor.  The firm also owns about 13% of online travel provider Kayak Software – a stake worth about $140 million at recent share prices.
VCJ subscribers can read more and see a table of recent Accel exits by clicking here.
On the M&A front, Accel’s performance is more difficult to gauge. The firm declined to respond to questions for this story, including ones about returns from recently acquired portfolio companies. Still, it appears that several provided a positive outcome. One was Amobee, a provider of mobile advertising services that raised early and later stage capital from Accel. 





So how does the road ahead look? My broad take is as follows: Accel, already one of the older and better-known Silicon Valley venture firms, got a major reputation boost from its investment in Facebook. This helped to raise a lot of money for for more recent generalist and specialist funds. Since then, Accel has been investing like crazy – backing something like 68 rounds this year, according to the Thomson Reuters database- which often misses smaller seed rounds.

Accel Partners Closes Accel XI and Growth II Funds with $1.35B


June 16, 2011
By PEHub Administrator






Accel Partners Closes Accel XI & Growth Fund II
The Palo Alto-based powerhouse Accel Partners has closed its latest two U.S. funds: Accel XI, a $475 million early-stage venture capital fund, and Accel Growth Fund II, a growth-stage fund that closed with $875 million. The company says it kicked off fundraising for both funds on April 26 — less than two months ago.
Accel closed its tenth, early-stage fund in 2007 with $520 million, and its ninth, early-stage fund with $400 million in 2004. Accel’s first growth fund was closed in 2008 with $480 million.
PRESS RELEASE:
Accel Partners today closed its latest two US funds, Accel XI at $475MM and Accel Growth Fund II at $875MM, for a total of $1.35B in US funds.    The fundraising kickoff date was April 26th.  For historical context on earlier Accel funds, Accel X (closed in 2007) was a $520MM fund and Accel IX (closed in 2004) was a $400MM fund.  Accel Growth I (closed in 2008) was a $480MM fund.
Range of Seed Investing, to Early Stage & Growth Equity Investing
As an example of Accel’s current investment activities, in past 12 months, Accel Partners (US) has invested in a broad range of companies ranging from seed investments to traditional venture financings to larger growth equity investments.  We continue to focus on being the first institutional investor of choice for entrepreneurs helping them build category defining companies, whether at seed, early or growth equity stages. Our focus going-forward remains the same in the new funds. . 





A few key deal factoids: in past 12 months, Accel has made investments from $100K to over $60 million in size
Over 25+ Seed investments such as: BaubleBar, MoPub, HotelsTonight, Summify, Cardspring
14 Early Stage investments such as:  BranchOut, Bonobos, ScaleXtreme, Yardsellr,
8 Growth Equity investments such as: 99Designs, OzForex, ShowroomPrive, Rovio, Squarespace, Yapstone et al
Accel Partners’ areas of investment focus remain similar to the historical themes of the past few years including:  Cloud Services & Next Gen Infrastructure, Social Media & Commerce, Gaming As A Service, Consumerization of Software, and Open Mobile among others.
Of note, Accel Partners opened its new New York office in January 2011.
A Perspective on Growth Equity Investing
To note,  Accel Partners strategy for growth investing is quite different from others in the industry that use similar terminology.  Of the investments to-date in the Growth fund, all were cash flow positive at time of investment. Accel Partners has been the first institutional capital in 75% of these growth deals, and 90%+ deals have had under $5MM of paid in capital at the time of investment.  Accel investments in Growth Equity I include:  Facebook, Groupon, 99Designs, Collective Media, OzForex, Atlassian, Squarespace, ShowroomPrive, Rovio, NextG Networks, & Yapstone.
The Accel Team
The partners investing in these funds include:  Andrew Braccia, Jim Breyer, Kevin Efrusy, Sameer Gandhi, Ping Li, Todd MacLean, Arthur Patterson, Theresia Gouw Ranzetta, Jim Swartz, Ryan Sweeney, and Rich Wong. 





To note, both Todd MacLean and Ryan Sweeney were investing partners who joined in the last 2 years, and in addition Tracy Sedlock was promoted to Chief Operating Partner
In addition, Accel has also added a number of new venture partners and execs-in-residence including, Rob Glaser, founder and former CEO of RealNetworks; Greg Waldorf, former CEO of eHarmony; and Kirk Bowman, former SVP sales at both EqualLogic & VMWare.
About Accel Partners
Founded in 1983, Accel Partners has a long history of partnering with outstanding entrepreneurs and management teams to build world-class businesses. Accel today invests globally using dedicated teams and market-specific strategies for local geographies, with offices in Palo Alto, California, New York City, London, New Delhi and Bangalore, as well as in China via its partnership with IDG-Accel.
