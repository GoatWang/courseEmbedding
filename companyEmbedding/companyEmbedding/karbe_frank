Frank Karbe, Exelixis





    Jun 01, 2009 

    By Pharmaceutical Executive Editors    
Pharmaceutical Executive





 

Frank Karbe

Chief Financial Officer, Exelixis

Prior to joining Exelixis, I was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, focusing on M&A and corporate finance. In my last three years at Goldman, I was part of the healthcare team in San Francisco. I spent the majority of my time with clients in the biotechnology industry, including Exelixis. I was especially excited about the opportunity to join the Exelixis team because I believe in the company's potential to innovate first- or best-in-class drugs, and to become a world-class biopharmaceutical company. Very few people, certainly at my age, get the opportunity to be part of an executive team that has a shot at building one of the leading companies in its industry. 
			





Given that Exelixis has taken an unusual approach for a pre-commercial biotech, we have an uncommon appetite for capital. Over the past four years, Exelixis has raised close to $1 billion in new funding—a majority of which has come from nondilutive sources. We have complemented our leadership in drug discovery with leadership in raising capital and business development. 
Scientific innovation will always be critical for success in the biotech and pharma industries. But there cannot be scientific progress without adequate funding, and this funding will not be available if our industry is not rewarded for its innovations.  
Efforts to reform US healthcare policy must address the need to reward innovation; we have to ensure that biotech and pharma products—and the companies that make them—are seen as solutions to the healthcare challenges we face, not as the problem. Innovative strategies for financing clinical candidates, accessing capital, monetizing assets, and partnerships are all critical to "feeding the beast."

      together with Frank, and benefiting from his years of industry and 
      financing experience as we continue to advance the Company and create 
      value for our shareholders.”
    

      Frank Karbe most recently served as Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Financial Officer of Exelixis, where he implemented and executed 
      financing strategies that resulted in raising over $2 billion. He also 
      contributed to the successful product launch of COMETRIQ in 2013 as well 
      as the planning and build-out of the commercial infrastructure to 
      support COMETRIQ. Prior to Exelixis, Mr. Karbe served as Vice

      Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a publicly held biopharmaceutical 
      company. Mr. Karbe holds a Diplom Kaufmann from the WHU-Otto Beisheim 
      Graduate School of Management, Koblenz, Germany (equivalent to a U.S. 
      Masters of Business Administration).
    

      Mr. Karbe stated, “I look forward to working with Kolltan’s world-class 
      leadership team, who have demonstrated great success in building 
      oncology companies and delivering novel therapies to patients. I am 
      honored to be given the opportunity to contribute to the advance of 
      promising new therapies that address unmet needs in cancer.”

Job Details
               Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines with the potential to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer. Since its founding in 1994, three medicines discovered at Exelixis have progressed through clinical development to receive regulatory approval. Currently, Exelixis is focused on advancing cabozantinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL and VEGF receptors, which has shown clinical anti-tumor activity in more than 20 forms of cancer and is the subject of a broad clinical development program. Two separate formulations of cabozantinib have received regulatory approval to treat certain forms of kidney and thyroid cancer and are marketed for those purposes as CABOMETYX tablets (U.S. and EU) and COMETRIQ capsules (U.S. and EU), respectively. Another Exelixis-discovered compound, COTELLIC (cobimetinib), a selective inhibitor of MEK, has been approved in major territories including the United States and European Union, and is being evaluated for further potential indications by Roche and Genentech (a member of the Roche Group) under a collaboration with Exelixis.
