Shanghai, China and MINNEAPOLIS June 28, 2017 (OTCIQ) -- Sage Convalescence Gaiety (“SCG”) a, Shanghai, China healthcare firm and OrangeHook, Inc. (OTCQB:  ORHK) (“OrangeHook”), announced today that they have reached an agreement on material terms and executed a non-binding term sheet to form a joint venture based in Shanghai for the delivery of healthcare infrastructure solutions in the China healthcare market.

Additional details of the transaction will be disclosed once a definitive agreement is executed.

						OrangeHook, Inc. to Aid in Colombian National Victim Repair Unit Initiative





													Details							

													Category: OrangeHook 





		

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Contact: Robert F. Riess, COO / CMO - OrangeHook, Inc.

MINNEAPOLIS, March 14, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Through a recently signed Agreement between Medsis, a U.S. based big data company, and the Colombian Government’s National Victims Repair Unit, an initiative was launched to modernize the entire Colombian citizens database system by means of the donation of Medsis’ big data management technology platform, CEREBRO, and OrangeHook resources. The system will convert all existing databases into a single unified civil registry. The use of CEREBRO, along with advanced state-of-the-art security protocols and algorithms, will allow identities of all registered victims to be safely verified and stored, creating efficiencies in all programs within the National Victims Repair Unit and potentially beyond. The National Victims Repair Unit was created to facilitate reparation payments which are a key component of the Colombian Government’s recent peace agreement with the FARC in their efforts to achieve a conclusion of the country’s 60-year-old internal conflict.
  


The project will provide a platform for the distribution of benefits to more than 8 million identified victims. Under terms of the agreement payments of approximately 1.2 Trillion Colombian Pesos ($400 Million USD) will be distributed annually over the next ten years, over 12 trillion pesos ($4B USD) in total.
  

  WAIV, an Australian company focused on payment applications, will be the financial bridge between the National Victims Repair Unit and the persons registered in it. Together with a known payment network for the WAIVCARD and the participation of a Colombian bank, WAIV will be responsible for integrating the MEDSIS: CEREBRO platform to accurately disburse the reparations and financial humanitarian aid to the people registered in the database. The integration with WAIV as a processor makes possible the accurate and timely procedure to manage and disburse the funds to the victims over the next 10 years.
  

DAX CABRERA, President and CEO of Medsis stated, “This historic project, to help heal the nation of Colombia, is exactly what Medsis was designed for. The vision of Colombia and of director ALAN JARA to provide humanitarian aid throughout Colombia, is an important global goal of Medsis.”
  
  
John Fenga, CEO of WAIV, expressed his satisfaction at being part of this initiative that will allow relief to victims of Colombia's unfortunate internal conflict, “We’re excited to be a part of this incredible opportunity,” said Fenga, “Helping the less fortunate is a key part of the WAIV philosophy.”
  

OrangeHook, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company, is an identification authentication company with systems and applications focused in healthcare, government, and data transfer accuracy.
  
 
James Mandel, OrangeHook CEO, stated, “We are delighted to be recognized as a leader in identification processes, and look forward to our continuing involvement in this historic program.”

DeVaun Assumes National Salamander Leadership Role



Morganton, NC — MARCH 7, 2017- Effective Monday, March 13, Rob DeVaun will assume the position of North American Sales Director for Salamander Technologies, an OrangeHook Company. DeVaun has worked as Technical Sales Consultant and Salamander Specialist for Bridgeway Solutions for the last few years advancing the Salamander footprint across the Southeast.
While Bridgeway Solutions is losing a key sales representative, DeVaun will continue his long-standing commitment to emergency management, incident command and the implementation of Salamander’s Intelligent Accountability™ suite across the U.S. He will maintain a supportive role for individual agencies and regions using the Solution, and will assist in the direction of sales and implementation within each territory.
  


“Rob isn’t really leaving us. As Adam Fray’s successor at Salamander Technologies, he will be tasked with helping us continue building upon the successes he, himself, helped drive in the Southeast over the past few years,” said David Lee, General Manager, Bridgeway Solutions. “His dedication, resourcefulness and work ethic will serve him well as he begins the next chapter of his career.”
  

“We are excited to be a part of Rob’s next chapter. Not only does Rob bring experience and success in managing state wide solutions, but he has the expertise to drive continued success with our channel partners,” said Robert F. Riess, COO/CMO - OrangeHook, Inc. “The additional support that Bridgeway has provided with this transition, in conjunction with Rob’s accomplishments, shows how dedicated our partners are to the solutions which Salamander provides”.
  

DeVaun joined Bridgeway Solutions in the fall of 2014 and quickly became the company’s driving force for the Salamander Solutions within the region. From DPRs in North Carolina, to state-wide adoption in South Carolina, and rapidly increasing adoption in Georgia and Virginia, DeVaun has worked closely with agencies large and small to find funding resources and implement the powerful incident command solution.
  

As of 2017, over 17,000 agencies have access to Salamander’s TAG, TRACK and REPORT Solution. From rescue efforts for Hurricane Matthew, to security personnel management for sporting events like the U.S. Open, the Salamander Solution has proven to be invaluable, with enabled real-time tracking of resources. Salamander’s latest editions allow responders to check-in as they are in route to an incident, commanders to know exactly who is on-scene and what their qualifications are, and when all is safely secured, to enable comprehensive reporting for maximum reimbursement from FEMA and other support agencies.

						Nuvel Announces Definitive Merger Agreement to Combine With OrangeHook, Inc.





													Details							

													Category: OrangeHook 





		

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Media Contact: Robert F. Riess, Chief Marketing Officer

-Upon completion, combined company will be an SEC reporting, publicly traded and fully integrated SaaS-based conglomerate of disruptive technology solutions centered on healthcare, big data, safety, and banking

-Transaction designed to establish public company platform that adds the OrangeHook suite of product and service offerings to Nuvel’s existing operations, substantially reduce Nuvel’s existing debt and preserve value opportunity for existing Nuvel shareholders



LOS GATOS, Calif. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuvel Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK:NUVL) has entered into a definitive merger agreement with OrangeHook, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a privately-held Software as a Service (SaaS) conglomerate.  Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be fully reporting and publicly-traded and will consist of five operating entities that use complementary proprietary technology to offer disruptive and potentially life-changing applications centered on healthcare, big-data, safety and banking.



The material terms of the agreement are summarized in a Current Report on Form 8-K of Nuvel filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, July 8, 2016.  In the transaction, Nuvel will issue shares of two new classes of preferred stock to OrangeHook shareholders in exchange for all of OrangeHook’s preferred and common stock.  Following the merger, Nuvel will effect a reverse split of its common stock, after which the preferred shares issued in the merger to OrangeHook’s common shareholders will convert into one share of common stock in the combined company for each share of OrangeHook common stock held immediately prior to the merger, and a substantial majority of Nuvel’s existing debt will be exchanged for equity in the combined company.   


The existing shareholders of Nuvel will have the opportunity to participate in ongoing growth opportunities in the combined company. Such shareholders who hold Nuvel common stock immediately after closing of the merger (or a record date declared shortly thereafter), will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of 357,143 shares of Nuvel common stock on a pro-rata basis if the Nuvel, Inc. operating entity achieves a $1.5 million revenue milestone, as measured and within the timeframes specified in the agreement.  Based on current projections, management of the combined company is optimistic about the achievement of the earn-out milestone. 


For purposes of structuring the transaction, the parties used an assumed $14 per share valuation for OrangeHook’s common stock, which is the same valuation that OrangeHook used to structure the prior acquisitions of its other portfolio companies.  Based on the assumed $14 per share valuation of OrangeHook common stock, the value of these prior transactions totaled approximately $53.2 million.  This assumed valuation of OrangeHook common stock was arbitrarily determined based upon pro-forma financial projections of OrangeHook management and there exists no quantifiable valuation analysis to support the same, aside from internal projections based upon existing contracts of the combined companies, among other factors.


Following the merger, the combined company will change its name to OrangeHook and plans to trade under a yet to be determined OrangeHook-related trading symbol. The combined company will immediately encompass the expanded offerings of the OrangeHook portfolio within the newly formed and recapitalized company. Subsequent to the merger, the combined company plans to apply for listing on a national securities exchange as soon as reasonably practical.


Rick Resnick, Nuvel’s CEO, commented, “This transaction allows Nuvel to more freely move forward as a result of the elimination of the vast majority of our current debt, which we believe positions the company for substantial growth and stability.  We believe the transaction offers a fair exchange for existing Nuvel common shareholders through the participation in a future earn-out distribution based on a revenue milestone we are confident of achieving.”


James Mandel, OrangeHook CEO, commented, “We are very pleased to achieve the next step in our company’s evolution, which sets the stage for the public launch of our suite of disruptive and potentially life-changing applications designed to change the world we live in for the better in areas including mobile payments, healthcare information, billing and payments, data compression and storage, and emergency responder coordination.  Although we acknowledge that we are setting a high bar with our operating goals, we strongly believe that customer acceptance of our solutions and the real world need for the same will validate our optimism.  We expect the coordinated and sophisticated deployment of our product and service offerings will create substantial value for existing OrangeHook and Nuvel shareholders, as well as future investors.”


Subject to satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the parties expect to close on the merger portion of the transaction in August 2016 and to effect the post-merger reverse split recapitalization to be completed by approximately Labor Day.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for certain forward-looking statements. Certain statements in this press release, including statements regarding the proposed merger between OrangeHook and Nuvel, the anticipated recapitalization, the value proposition of the transaction for existing Nuvel shareholders, targeted future revenue amounts for Nuvel, Inc. and operating results for the combined company, the anticipated completion dates for the merger and reverse split, and the assumed valuation for OrangeHook common stock (and the corresponding aggregate value of OrangeHook’s prior acquisitions), are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on current expectations and intentions, as well as assumptions and estimates that management believed to be credible and reasonable but that are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause outcomes to differ from what is expected, including risks that the merger will not close in a timely manner or at all, or that the combined companies’ operating results will not meet management’s expectations.

LifeNexus


LifeNexus is an OrangeHook company in the consumer healthcare technology space and creators of iChip®, headquartered in Roseville, CA. iChip enables consumers to instantly access and share their personal health information when and where they need it. Leveraging payer data, analytics and programs, the technology automatically updates and populates an iChip Health Record that consumers can view, enhance and share using the iChip mobile app, web portal or chip-enabled benefits ID card.
Incorporated in 2004, LifeNexus became the developer of the nation’s first multi-purpose consumer health card, the Personal Health Card®. Consumer-entered health information was stored on the physical card and shared during emergency situations. Through relationships with MasterCard and Visa, the Personal Health Card was expanded to include optional payment functionality.

Capitalizing on extensive testing and research and changing market opportunities, the product has evolved from a direct-to-consumer emergency card to a mass-market robust platform used for everyday healthcare needs. The most recent version of the company’s consumer engagement platform was released in the spring of 2013. The iChip platform uses cloud-based computing along with consumer tools, including a chip-enabled insurance card and smart-phone application to provide access to personal health information when and where it is needed. Through these technologies, a patient has anywhere, anytime access to his or her electronic healthcare record.

iChip is designed to improve healthcare experiences and outcomes by delivering consumer-controlled health information that is automatically updated and presented at the point of care. By putting the information in the hands of the consumer, iChip ensures that essential health information gets past the front desk and into the treatment room where it is most valuable. With iChip, health plans and other risk entities are better equipped to address many of today’s most pressing issues including improving quality metrics like Star ratings and HEDIS measures, closing gaps in care, improving risk score coding, improving member engagement and satisfaction rates, all which contribute to better diagnoses and treatments leading to better health outcomes. 


How iChip Works:


  The iChip platform draws relevant consumer health and insurance data, including administrative, clinical and analytic information from all available data sources (payer eligibility and claims database, provider EMR/EHR, consumer self-reported) and assembles it into a continuously updated, longitudinal health record that can be linked to family members, shared with remote care teams or pushed at the point of care to facilitate check-in.
  Consumers can access their personal health information anytime on any web-enabled device and maintain complete control of when and where their information is shared. When consumers show up at iChip participating providers, they can use the smart-phone app or chip-enabled insurance card to facilitate a more seamless check-in.














 
 










Company built by a team of senior healthcare and technology executives, each with 20+ years of experience across payer, provider and consumer segments
iChip uses widely-adopted consumer technology to put personalized health information and analytics in the hands of consumers and their caregivers wherever and whenever they need it to improve the consumer’s healthcare experience, improve the caregiver’s ability to diagnose and treat, and foster engagement
Platform built end-to-end on HIPPA secure, cloud-based technology that leverages proprietary encryption techniques, leading-edge mobile capabilities such as geolocation-enabled rapid patient check-in
Underlying the iChip solution are patent-protected intellectual property (11 issued, 2 pending) and trademarks (8 registered, 1 pending) 
The iChip solution leverages consumer-centric design founded on principles of accepted behavioral science to foster optimal patient engagement (specifically the motivations for participation, management, sustainment, self-efficacy, and well-being), while also addressing the emotional needs of patients











Mission Statement  


To ensure that every individual has their healthcare information available when and where they need it 
On the platform consumers want; used by providers in the way they want

LifeMed ID, Inc. fits into OrangeHook's key area of focus: PATIENT VALIDATION.
The company's solution AIMeTM  leverages cloud-based technology that verifies patient information at any point care.

 










Why us:
We are all patients. We believe in leveraging collective ideas and focusing on possibilities that directly impact the things that matter.











How we do it:
We provide the source of truth through a digital identifier that is unique, interoperable and secure











What we provide:
AIMe™: a deterministic patient identity platform 
















About LifeMed ID


Based in Sacramento County, founded in 2008
Industry pioneer in authoritative digital identity management
Cloud-based software
Key Partnerships:
Zebra Technologies
IBM
VisionWare
QuadraMed
iStream / Apex
    

  “I’ve participated in industry standard development in the past, however, no one was pushing for them to be implemented. When in the absence of the federal government creating such standards, the industry has to lead these changes. LifeMed ID can help tremendously with these proliferations” - Nancy Farrington | CHAM, FHAM, EMPI Administrator, Health Information Management

 “The economic value is very positive; registration time was cut from four minutes to one minute. We are issuing an average of 500 smart cards daily, significantly diminishing the amount of time needed by our people to enter, update, and cleanse patient information. We also know the last time the patient information was updated, when they were seen, and the last time their insurance was checked.” - Gale Stoy, IT Director | Mid Coast Health Services
    


Mission Statement
At LifeMed ID, we strive to optimize the patient experience and reduce healthcare costs by providing innovative and adaptive technology that addresses indisputable challenges in the industry. Achieving the positive shift starts with what our team has successfully accomplished; unprecedented patient processing accuracy by ensuring that the right patient is matched to the correct record every time.

Vision Statement
Provides a groundbreaking foundation from which healthcare organizations can welcome patients and successfully manage their care across the continuum. By providing an expedient registration process, registrars can focus less on bureaucracy and more on each patient.

Core Values

The LifeMed ID team ensures our solution addresses industry needs and we are committed to empowering individuals to surpass obstacles, maintain accountability, and sustain a positive work environment. It is our imperative to provide users with the most innovative and reliable solutions in the market with unsurpassed, rapid support. Solving identity is a challenge, and every team member holds themselves to the highest standards of ethics and business acumen to make a lifelong and significant difference in the industry. We thrive as a company by setting high expectations of ourselves and meeting those standards through continuous discovery and improvement though: 


Trust| Integrity
Entrepreneurial Leadership
Innovative Collaboration
Perseverance | Dedication
Teamwork | Program Ownership
Forward Thinking













Industry Background

A complete and trusted patient identity is the basis for healthcare. Without it, the industry struggles to ensure that each party is sharing correct information about the correct patient. Current registration is set up to capture patient demographics and generate a record for that patient. However, this process stops short of establishing a highly reliable identity, making it difficult for a patient’s record to be confidently known and shared across the care continuum. This puts the patient and organization at risk. Common elements that contribute to this obstacle are human error and fraud (name spelling, name change from marriage, nick names, outdated vs. current addresses, insurance status and others).  

 
News and Press




















 
 


 





How the solution works:

Establishing a source of truth for health systems globally starts by establishing multi-factor authentication for patients – a design that confirms identity by utilizing a combination of least two different factors: something you have, something you know, something you are. We call this a secure patient token, and it establishes the “1 patient, 1 record” or “1 patient, all correct records” concept. This platform can be applied across public and private healthcare environments and initiatives, including Health Systems, Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), Population Health, Integrated Care, private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid, and others. 


LifeMed ID, Inc. enables healthcare to develop a robust patient identity infrastructure for better care delivery.

Why us:
We believe in making sure that everyone gets home safely at the end of the day.











How we do it:
Ensure that the RIGHT PEOPLE, are at the RIGHT PLACE, at the RIGHT TIME, with the RIGHT CREDENTIALS











What we provide:
INTELLIGENT ACCOUNTABILITY™: TAG, TRACK and REPORT
















About Salamander


A  Michigan Corp, based in Traverse City, founded June  2001
Purchased by OrangeHook, Inc. in 2015
No. 1 supplier of personnel accountability systems for First Responders
Originated TAG, TRACK, and REPORT as the foundation of INTELLIGENT ACCOUNTABILITY™
INTELLIGENT ACCOUNTABILITY™ is made up of online solutions, offline solutions, mobile apps, and manual solutions
Over 700,000 personnel ID's are currently managed the Salamander platform

National Sales Channel built on Direct Sales, RTC's, Resellers, and Agents
Industry pioneer in the use of cloud computing and mobility applications (Android and iOS)
11 states currently have implemented Salamander TAG Solution for Emergency Management





Mission Statement  


At Salamander, we are saving lives of our 1st Responders and the citizens they protect by offering a superior automatic identification system that accounts for all personnel, verifies responder identities, and provides a common operating picture during an incident, emergency or field event.  Our contributions to homeland security will accelerate as the Salamander solution fulfills the national imperative for a unified system to identify and track all participants of a large-scale incident – responders, volunteers, and civilian victims.



  Vision Statement


Provide an easy to use, affordable, scalable and redundant platform for interagency resource accountability – from the tag to the web – that complies with federal mandates for the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV).



Core Values  

Purpose.  We are guided by a noble mission – the safety and well-being of our first responders and the citizens they protect.  Our vision is to provide a superior automatic identification and tracking solution to enhance the situational awareness of all personal during an incident, field event, or mass disaster.
Integrity.  We conduct business with the highest level of honesty and transparency.  Trust is fundamental to our relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and investors. 
Nimble.  We are fast to adapt to an ever changing  market.  As technology churn occurs faster and faster, we will anticipate change and make the right choices at the right time to maintain our leadership.
Customer Driven.  We are accountable to our customers.  At the end of the day, our responsiveness to their needs will determine our success as a company. 
Perseverance.  Confident in our mission and vision, we will overcome all obstacles and challenges to our success.  We will not only survive, we will thrive.













Industry Background

Identification, tracking and monitoring are the core pillars of accountability, and are essential to the infrastructure for emergency response management.  Emergency response management must always be prepared to manage any incident or event – planned or unplanned – and oversee accountability to mitigate possible situations and ensure the safety of others. However, standard accountability tools in the field do not enable response teams to meet expectations set by the government. Today, teams are set up to manage data, resources and individuals manually – pen and paper, radio, etc. – all of which obstruct and restrict situational awareness and reporting, and put on-scene individuals at risk.

 
News and Press




















 
 


 





How the solution works:

There are three key components to a successful accountability protocol: identification of people and resources, live-tracking and reliable data collection. These are accomplished by automating existing processes to help paint an all-encompassing, real-time picture as the incident or event size and complexity change during an operational period. We call this INTELLIGENT ACCOUNTABILITY™ and it can be applied across government and private sectors, including fire and rescue, emergency management, event management, site security, law enforcement and others.


Salamander Technologies, LLC. enables emergency response to be ready before having to react, make well-informed decisions in times of distress and quickly shift and rely on available resources to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of the day.

Nuvel Announces Definitive Merger Agreement to Combine With OrangeHook, Inc.
-Upon completion, combined company will be an SEC reporting, publicly traded and fully integrated SaaS-based conglomerate of disruptive technology solutions centered on healthcare, big data, safety, and banking
-Transaction designed to establish public company platform that adds the OrangeHook suite of product and service offerings to Nuvel’s existing operations, substantially reduce Nuvel’s existing debt and preserve value opportunity for existing Nuvel shareholders 
LOS GATOS, Calif. and MINNEAPOLIS, July 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuvel Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK:NUVL) has entered into a definitive merger agreement with OrangeHook, Inc., of Minneapolis, Minnesota, a privately-held Software as a Service (SaaS) conglomerate.  Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be fully reporting and publicly-traded and will consist of five operating entities that use complementary proprietary technology to offer disruptive and potentially life-changing applications centered on healthcare, big-data, safety and banking.
The material terms of the agreement are summarized in a Current Report on Form 8-K of Nuvel filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, July 8, 2016.  In the transaction, Nuvel will issue shares of two new classes of preferred stock to OrangeHook shareholders in exchange for all of OrangeHook’s preferred and common stock.  Following the merger, Nuvel will effect a reverse split of its common stock, after which the preferred shares issued in the merger to OrangeHook’s common shareholders will convert into one share of common stock in the combined company for each share of OrangeHook common stock held immediately prior to the merger, and a substantial majority of Nuvel’s existing debt will be exchanged for equity in the combined company.   
The existing shareholders of Nuvel will have the opportunity to participate in ongoing growth opportunities in the combined company. Such shareholders who hold Nuvel common stock immediately after closing of the merger (or a record date declared shortly thereafter), will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of 357,143 shares of Nuvel common stock on a pro-rata basis if the Nuvel, Inc. operating entity achieves a $1.5 million revenue milestone, as measured and within the timeframes specified in the agreement.  Based on current projections, management of the combined company is optimistic about the achievement of the earn-out milestone. 
For purposes of structuring the transaction, the parties used an assumed $14 per share valuation for OrangeHook’s common stock, which is the same valuation that OrangeHook used to structure the prior acquisitions of its other portfolio companies.  Based on the assumed $14 per share valuation of OrangeHook common stock, the value of these prior transactions totaled approximately $53.2 million.  This assumed valuation of OrangeHook common stock was arbitrarily determined based upon pro-forma financial projections of OrangeHook management and there exists no quantifiable valuation analysis to support the same, aside from internal projections based upon existing contracts of the combined companies, among other factors.
Following the merger, the combined company will change its name to OrangeHook and plans to trade under a yet to be determined OrangeHook-related trading symbol. The combined company will immediately encompass the expanded offerings of the OrangeHook portfolio within the newly formed and recapitalized company. Subsequent to the merger, the combined company plans to apply for listing on a national securities exchange as soon as reasonably practical.
Rick Resnick, Nuvel’s CEO, commented, “This transaction allows Nuvel to more freely move forward as a result of the elimination of the vast majority of our current debt, which we believe positions the company for substantial growth and stability.  We believe the transaction offers a fair exchange for existing Nuvel common shareholders through the participation in a future earn-out distribution based on a revenue milestone we are confident of achieving.”
James Mandel, OrangeHook CEO, commented, “We are very pleased to achieve the next step in our company’s evolution, which sets the stage for the public launch of our suite of disruptive and potentially life-changing applications designed to change the world we live in for the better in areas including mobile payments, healthcare information, billing and payments, data compression and storage, and emergency responder coordination.  Although we acknowledge that we are setting a high bar with our operating goals, we strongly believe that customer acceptance of our solutions and the real world need for the same will validate our optimism.  We expect the coordinated and sophisticated deployment of our product and service offerings will create substantial value for existing OrangeHook and Nuvel shareholders, as well as future investors.”
Subject to satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the parties expect to close on the merger portion of the transaction in August 2016 and to effect the post-merger reverse split recapitalization to be completed by approximately Labor Day.

More at http://www.orangehook.com.
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for certain forward-looking statements. Certain statements in this press release, including statements regarding the proposed merger between OrangeHook and Nuvel, the anticipated recapitalization, the value proposition of the transaction for existing Nuvel shareholders, targeted future revenue amounts for Nuvel, Inc. and operating results for the combined company, the anticipated completion dates for the merger and reverse split, and the assumed valuation for OrangeHook common stock (and the corresponding aggregate value of OrangeHook’s prior acquisitions), are forward-looking in nature. These statements are based on current expectations and intentions, as well as assumptions and estimates that management believed to be credible and reasonable but that are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause outcomes to differ from what is expected, including risks that the merger will not close in a timely manner or at all, or that the combined companies’ operating results will not meet management’s expectations.

Our banking platform then enables us to process all healthcare related transactions throughout the continuum of care. The resultant sets of Big Data give better data to both the payor and the consumer all supported by a better means of identity.

                Examples include: ACH, Debit and Credit Card Payment Solution.

WHY "ORANGE"?
WHY "HOOK"?



Our unusual name invokes an easy introduction, familiarity, yet stands out in the crowd.
                  Cheerful orange evokes exuberance, fun and vitality. Also known for: self-confidence, independence, extroversion and boldness.


You have heard the saying, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."  We provide the structure and resources to enable companies to be successful for years to come.
