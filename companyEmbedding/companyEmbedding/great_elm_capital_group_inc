Firm Leadership



Board of Directors



Corporate Governance



Investor Relations


 



 















Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (“Great Elm”) is a publicly-traded holding company. Over the next five years, Great Elm intends to build a diversified investment company comprised of the following three business lines: investment management, real estate and merchant banking.
 


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT The Great Elm Capital Management (“GECM”) investment team has deep experience investing in leveraged middle market companies. The GECM team has deployed more than $17 billion into credit investments in more than 550 issuers across 20+ jurisdictions over its 14-year history under MAST Capital Management, LLC (“MAST”). Led by Chief Investment Officer Peter A. Reed, GECM’s investment team has more than 100 years of experience in the aggregate financing and investing in leveraged middle market companies.
Great Elm’s first investment vehicle is Great Elm Capital Corp. (“GECC”), a business development company.
REAL ESTATE
Great Elm seeks to acquire real estate assets in upper-tier metropolitan statistical areas that are both characterized by long-term, residual value and financed with high leverage. Great Elm focuses on properties currently leased by investment grade tenants, using tax-sheltered income from the lessee to service the debt Great Elm borrows to purchase the property. Great Elm is pursuing credit tenant lease financings, ground lease structures and secondary market property purchases. Great Elm is an enduring real estate investor with a keen focus on preservation of capital. 
MERCHANT BANKING Building on our team’s experience in long-term investing, Great Elm intends to leverage its core competencies in M&A and leveraged finance to buy, grow and hold high quality businesses in attractive industries. Great Elm intends to build a portfolio of control investments with a view toward owning these companies for the long-term. Great Elm will then seek to grow these portfolio companies both organically and through M&A.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
