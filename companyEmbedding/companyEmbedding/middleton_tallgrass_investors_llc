                            JLL completes $67.3 million sale of Tallgrass Corporate Center
                        





























​CHICAGO, Oct. 11, 2016 – Investors are looking toward Chicago’s suburban office product as cap rates continue to compress. On behalf of Equus Capital Partners, LTD., JLL Capital Markets today announced the firm completed the sale of Tallgrass Corporate Center in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook, Illinois. Middleton Partners purchased the 533,363-square-foot Class A office asset for $67.3 million. Managing Director James Postweiler and Executive Vice President Peter Harwood led JLL on the sale and teamed with the building’s leasing agent, Francis Prock, Principal at Colliers. “Our client successfully repositioned this asset over the last several years into a fully leased, multi-tenanted building that is headquarters to several high-performing businesses,” said Postweiler. Added Joseph Neverauskas, Senior Vice President of Acquisitions at Equus: “Through our value-add strategy, we were able to uniquely position a formerly vacant corporate facility in a submarket where Class A offices are hard to come by. The property has become a city in itself.” Located one mile north of Interstate 55, Tallgrass Corporate Center offers tenants access to several major thoroughfares that connect to the surrounding suburbs and Chicago. The building sits on 50 acres of land and features state-of-the-art amenities that allow it to be completely self-contained. Amenities include a redeveloped fitness center with locker rooms and showers, high-tech conference rooms, a cafeteria and a 225-seat auditorium. “This was an especially attractive investment considering the high barrier for competition to enter the market as Tallgrass Corporate Center is one of the few Class A office assets in the area,” said Christopher Locatell, Senior Vice President of Dispositions for Equus. “This asset has a proven track record of providing steady cash yields as it has leased up,” said Peter Holstein of Middleton Partners. “We anticipate that trend to continue as this asset enjoys a roster of high-quality, diverse tenants.” JLL Capital Markets is a full-service global provider of capital solutions for real estate investors and occupiers. The firm’s in-depth local market and global investor knowledge delivers the best-in-class solutions for clients — whether a sale, financing, repositioning, advisory or recapitalization execution. In 2015 alone, JLL Capital Markets completed $140 billion in investment sale and debt and equity transactions globally. The firm’s Capital Markets team comprises more than 2,000 specialists, operating all over the globe. For more news, please visit The Investor, an online and mobile app news source providing real-time commercial real estate news to asset buyers and sellers around the world.For more news, videos and research resources on JLL, please visit the firm’s U.S. media center Web page:http://bit.ly/18P2tkv.-Ends- About Equus Capital Partners, Ltd.Equus Capital Partners, Ltd .is one of the nation’s leading private equity real estate fund managers.  Equus’ portfolio consists of over 24 million square feet of office, retail, student housing, and industrial properties and more than 16,000 apartment units in over 65 communities located throughout the United States.

Middleton Tallgrass Investors LLC SEC Filing Form D  4/2016, submited: 2016-10-31<< back to list of filingsForm DA filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
