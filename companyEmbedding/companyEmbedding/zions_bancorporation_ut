SALT LAKE CITY and MUMBAI, India, July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) (BSE: 532540, NSE:TCS), a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organization, announced today that Zions Bancorporation has gone live on TCS BaNCS for Core Banking with the successful transition of Zions Bancorporation's Consumer Lending business over to the TCS BaNCS platform, a major milestone in the North American Banking industry's march towards modernization.



Zions Bancorporation selected TCS BaNCS after an extensive review of U.S. and global core banking vendors. The core transformation program, titled "FutureCore," is divided into phases and Consumer Lending for the 7 affiliate banks is the first phase to go live, with other phases to follow.  
Scott McLean, president and COO of Zions Bancorporation, said, "The completion of this consumer lending installation represents our first step toward having a fully integrated core loan and deposit system. This project has served as an impetus for us to address customer and employee frustration points, simplify and de-risk how we do business, and make us more agile in adapting to future digital technology, customer and regulatory expectations. Ultimately, having a simplified back office and providing significantly greater information to our frontline bankers has a meaningful impact to customers. This core transformation initiative is foundational to our digital transformation objectives: to improve the customer experience, digitize and streamline operations, and better leverage our data assets to better serve our customers." 
Ashvini Saxena, head of Americas for TCS BaNCS, said, "The successful deployment of TCS BaNCS at Zions is testimony to the commitment from both Zions and TCS to make this happen. It's a significant landmark not just for TCS and for Zions, but for the banking industry in North America. The TCS BaNCS deployment provides Zions a parameterized, U.S. market compliant, real-time solution, sets up Zions to go digital, be nimble and efficient, and ultimately shift to a customer centric approach." 
Commenting on the go-live, Joe Reilly, chief technology strategist of Zions Bancorporation, said, "TCS' experience in large program delivery has been demonstrated extensively throughout the FutureCore program. We selected TCS because of the TCS BaNCS product's rich functionality, the company's extensive track record of successful implementations around the world, and their focus and flexibility in ensuring that our program is a success and really stands out."

History[edit]




Zions retail footprint


Zions' history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which was opened in the fall of 1873 by Brigham Young during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company.
During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow.[2]
During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as:[2]

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. But even with this interruption, deposits grew.[citation needed]
Great Depression[edit]
At the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Zions was in a very sound financial position.[citation needed] On the morning of February 15, 1932, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part:

[The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the Nation.[2]

Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression.[3]
At the end of 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City.[3] The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank.
1960-2007[edit]
In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it became shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah.[4]
Zions went public in January 1966.[3]
Throughout the long bear market of the 1970s, its stock performed well, rising from its low, early in that decade, to ten times in value by 1985, with a three-for-two split in 1981. By 1986 the company had a book value of over US$170 million, with steady annual earnings of over US$26 million.
It expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank.[2][5]
The company entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank.[2][6]
It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank.
Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998.[7]
In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado.[8] Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho.[9] It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo.[10]
Zions expanded into California in 1997, Washington in 1998, Oregon and Texas in 2005.
In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but it was acquired by Wells Fargo[11] after Zions was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions.[12] However, after the acquisition closed, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah.
In 2001, the company was added to the S&P 500 stock market index.[13]
2008-present[edit]
In September 2008, one of Zions' subsidiaries, Nevada State Bank, acquired the insured deposits of failed Silver State Bank, which was closed by Nevada state officials. Silver State was the 11th bank to fail in 2008.
On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ.[14]
Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The final $700 million was repaid on September 26, 2012 and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company.[15][16]
On June 1, 2015, Zions Bancorporation announced a corporate restructuring in order to cut an estimated $120 Million in operational expenses. Under the restructure, all of the affiliates will cease to exist as separate entities; local banks will maintain the same branding, but will legally all be the same company.[17]

You used to have some really good people there. How many more have to leave.

Numerous opportunities to move around and gain new skills. A college degree is helpful in getting into higher paying positions, but I also know many managers who do not have degrees.ConsAs with any large company, politics and protection of territory sometimes gets in the way of getting things done.Advice to ManagementRefocus on what matters most. Make it OK to discuss issues openly, rather than being concerned about the team getting a black eye if someone knows that something went wrong. Stop hiring managers who have no experience in the type of work they will be managing, particularly in back-office operations and IT. Where necessary, even in high-level upper management, make tough changes.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Zions Bancorporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Zions Bancorporation 2013-06-25 07:46 PDT May 16, 2013 Helpful (2)"Lots of promises, no delivery."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Systems Engineer in Salt Lake City, UTFormer Employee - Systems Engineer in Salt Lake City, UTDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Zions Bancorporation full-time (More than 5 years)ProsWork flexibility (while it lasted). Lots of new technology whether the bank needs it or not. Good people to work with (until they leave). There are opportunities to learn and grow if you take the initiative to find them for yourself.ConsHorrible benefits. Inept management. No leadership at executive level. Zions Bancorporation and more specifically the IT organization has become a very toxic organization to work for. All decisions at the executive level are made based on the ego of one particular person. Technology fit and what is best for the organization take a back seat. It's disheartening to see millions (literally) wasted on unnecessary purchases when on the other hand we refuse to invest in things we need. This has led to a mass exodus of talent leaving a bunch of less than qualified people holding the bag. Oh, and did I mention the benefits are horrible?They have recently kicked off a core replacement project that is already headed down the wrong direction. Steer clear when the project fails as they will be looking for people to take the fall for the failures of management.I tried to stick it out hoping that it would get better but after years of only seeing things get worse I had no choice but to move on.Advice to ManagementI don't think at this point there is any advice that would help management. They are either a key part of the problem or have their heads too deep in the sand to notice. Stop getting on quarterly conference calls and telling us that we have great health insurance. It's a lie and we all know it. It's insulting.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Zions Bancorporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Zions Bancorporation 2013-05-16 08:33 PDT Mar 31, 2013"Excellent career path"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Intern - Compliance Analyst in Salt Lake City, UTCurrent Intern - Compliance Analyst in Salt Lake City, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Zions Bancorporation as an intern (Less than a year)ProsNetwork, a good place to start your career, excellent working atmosphere, competitive salary rate, flexible working hoursConsI had a great experience working for themShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Zions Bancorporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Zions Bancorporation 2013-03-31 21:45 PDT Mar 21, 2013"It certainly keeps me busy and on my toes--I'm only beginning so it's not a huge thrill yet but the future looks good."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Bank Card Operations Specialist in Salt Lake City, UTCurrent Employee - Bank Card Operations Specialist in Salt Lake City, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Zions Bancorporation full-time (Less than a year)ProsExcellent People to work with, Management is professional, makes clear instructions and expectations.ConsNature of this particular job is Redundant. Difficult to be at a computer all day doing the same thing day in day out.Advice to ManagementAcknowledging the difficulties with expansion and manning problems and the need to quickly get tasks done--a better training program if implemented correctly would streamline the in-processing of new employees and provide a more thorough understanding from day one--vs. a prolonged training period--feeling like I'm floundering for over a month by asking the most basic questions.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Zions Bancorporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Zions Bancorporation 2013-03-21 08:54 PDT Feb 9, 2013 Helpful (1)"Overall a good place to work."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Credit Analyst in Salt Lake City, UTCurrent Employee - Senior Credit Analyst in Salt Lake City, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Zions Bancorporation full-time (Less than a year)Pros- My direct managers are awesome, very helpful, supportive and always willing to listen to my ideas. Very much an "open door" place to work.- Co-workers are very friendly and professional.- Good teachers at the training center.Cons- The health insurance is not really insurance, the deductibles are so high it's a joke. Basically you just pay for all of your medical problems out of pocket, so either be young and healthy, or have your spouse work somewhere with normal insurance.- Compensation is okay but definitely not a selling point.Advice to Management- Long-term you are going to lose a lot of talented people over your health insurance plan, people want co-pays and 80/20 coverage. They don't want to have the nagging fear in the back of their mind that if they get hurt they are going to need a loan to cover their medical bills.- Having a real training program for new hires would be nice, yes my on the job training was fine but having a structured program for the first few weeks would be great.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Zions Bancorporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Zions Bancorporation 2013-02-09 13:33 PST Showing 115 of 228 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious7891011NextReviews > Salt Lake City > Zions Bancorporation RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleFinancial Analyst (9) Business Analyst (6) Analyst (4) Manager (3) Peak-time Teller (3) Systems Engineer (3) IT Customer Support Specialist I (2) AML Compliance Analyst (2) Intern (2) IT Systems Administrator (2) Auditor (2) Teller (2) Assistant Vice President (2) IT Management (2) IT Manager (2) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreZions Bancorporation PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsHealth InsuranceVacation & Paid Time Off401K PlanEmployee DiscountRetirement PlanAdd BenefitsSee AllSee AllAffiliated Companies Job Seekers Also ViewedZions Bank ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 191 ReviewsGoldman Sachs ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 4,246 ReviewsOverstock.com ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 704 ReviewsWells Fargo ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 16,801 ReviewsAmegy Corporation ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 121 ReviewsGenesys ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 620 ReviewsIntermountain Healthcare ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 629 ReviewsDomo ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 236 ReviewsEMC ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 4,387 ReviewsFidelity Investments ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 4,696 ReviewsMorgan Stanley ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 5,316 ReviewsAmerican Express ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 5,029 Reviews Related Job SearchBusiness Analyst jobsBusiness Analyst salaries ($66k)Financial Analyst jobsFinancial Analyst salaries ($63k)Call Center Representative jobsCall Center Representative salaries ($24k)IT Manager jobsIT Manager salaries ($110k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Implementation Manager jobsImplementation Manager salaries ($76k)Vice President jobsVice President salaries ($148k)Risk Analyst jobsRisk Analyst salaries ($70k)Customer Service Representative jobsCustomer Service Representative salaries ($25k)Business Analyst III jobsBusiness Analyst III salaries ($81k)Senior Project Manager jobsSenior Project Manager salaries ($111k)Salt Lake City JobsInterested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

History[edit]




Zions retail footprint


Zions' history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which was opened in the fall of 1873 by Brigham Young during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company.
During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow.[2]
During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as:[2]

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. But even with this interruption, deposits grew.[citation needed]
Great Depression[edit]
At the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Zions was in a very sound financial position.[citation needed] On the morning of February 15, 1932, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part:

[The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the Nation.[2]

Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression.[3]
At the end of 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City.[3] The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank.
1960-2007[edit]
In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it became shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah.[4]
Zions went public in January 1966.[3]
Throughout the long bear market of the 1970s, its stock performed well, rising from its low, early in that decade, to ten times in value by 1985, with a three-for-two split in 1981. By 1986 the company had a book value of over US$170 million, with steady annual earnings of over US$26 million.
It expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank.[2][5]
The company entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank.[2][6]
It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank.
Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998.[7]
In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado.[8] Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho.[9] It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo.[10]
Zions expanded into California in 1997, Washington in 1998, Oregon and Texas in 2005.
In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but it was acquired by Wells Fargo[11] after Zions was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions.[12] However, after the acquisition closed, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah.
In 2001, the company was added to the S&P 500 stock market index.[13]
2008-present[edit]
In September 2008, one of Zions' subsidiaries, Nevada State Bank, acquired the insured deposits of failed Silver State Bank, which was closed by Nevada state officials. Silver State was the 11th bank to fail in 2008.
On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ.[14]
Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The final $700 million was repaid on September 26, 2012 and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company.[15][16]
On June 1, 2015, Zions Bancorporation announced a corporate restructuring in order to cut an estimated $120 Million in operational expenses. Under the restructure, all of the affiliates will cease to exist as separate entities; local banks will maintain the same branding, but will legally all be the same company.[17]

History[edit]




Zions retail footprint


Zions' history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which was opened in the fall of 1873 by Brigham Young during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company.
During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow.[2]
During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as:[2]

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. But even with this interruption, deposits grew.[citation needed]
Great Depression[edit]
At the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Zions was in a very sound financial position.[citation needed] On the morning of February 15, 1932, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part:

[The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the Nation.[2]

Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression.[3]
At the end of 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City.[3] The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank.
1960-2007[edit]
In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it became shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah.[4]
Zions went public in January 1966.[3]
Throughout the long bear market of the 1970s, its stock performed well, rising from its low, early in that decade, to ten times in value by 1985, with a three-for-two split in 1981. By 1986 the company had a book value of over US$170 million, with steady annual earnings of over US$26 million.
It expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank.[2][5]
The company entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank.[2][6]
It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank.
Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998.[7]
In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado.[8] Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho.[9] It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo.[10]
Zions expanded into California in 1997, Washington in 1998, Oregon and Texas in 2005.
In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but it was acquired by Wells Fargo[11] after Zions was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions.[12] However, after the acquisition closed, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah.
In 2001, the company was added to the S&P 500 stock market index.[13]
2008-present[edit]
In September 2008, one of Zions' subsidiaries, Nevada State Bank, acquired the insured deposits of failed Silver State Bank, which was closed by Nevada state officials. Silver State was the 11th bank to fail in 2008.
On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ.[14]
Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The final $700 million was repaid on September 26, 2012 and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company.[15][16]

Under the restructure, all of the affiliates will cease to exist as separate entities; local banks will maintain the same branding, but will legally all be the same company.[17]

History[edit]




Zions retail footprint


Zions' history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which was opened in the fall of 1873 by Brigham Young during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company.
During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow.[2]
During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as:[2]

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. But even with this interruption, deposits grew.[citation needed]
Great Depression[edit]
At the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Zions was in a very sound financial position.[citation needed] On the morning of February 15, 1932, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part:

[The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the Nation.[2]

Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression.[3]
At the end of 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City.[3] The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank.
1960-2007[edit]
In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it became shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah.[4]
Zions went public in January 1966.[3]
Throughout the long bear market of the 1970s, its stock performed well, rising from its low, early in that decade, to ten times in value by 1985, with a three-for-two split in 1981. By 1986 the company had a book value of over US$170 million, with steady annual earnings of over US$26 million.
It expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank.[2][5]
The company entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank.[2][6]
It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank.
Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998.[7]
In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado.[8] Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho.[9] It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo.[10]
Zions expanded into California in 1997, Washington in 1998, Oregon and Texas in 2005.
In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but it was acquired by Wells Fargo[11] after Zions was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions.[12] However, after the acquisition closed, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah.
In 2001, the company was added to the S&P 500 stock market index.[13]
2008-present[edit]
In September 2008, one of Zions' subsidiaries, Nevada State Bank, acquired the insured deposits of failed Silver State Bank, which was closed by Nevada state officials. Silver State was the 11th bank to fail in 2008.
On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ.[14]
Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The final $700 million was repaid on September 26, 2012 and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company.[15][16]
On June 1, 2015, Zions Bancorporation announced a corporate restructuring in order to cut an estimated $120 Million in operational expenses. Under the restructure, all of the affiliates will cease to exist as separate entities; local banks will maintain the same branding, but will legally all be the same company.[17]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
