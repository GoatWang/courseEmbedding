THE ADVANTAGE OF JOINING US
 




 ABOUT US > Board of Trustees 



J. Sebastian Scripps 
Sebastian  Scripps has served on the boards of American Dance Festival of New York,  Rectory School in Connecticut, and The Linden Hill School of Massachusetts. He  has a long experience in board work and a strong track record of strategic  philanthropic giving. As a donor, he is primarily interested in bolstering  education opportunities for the disadvantaged and those with learning  differences. He has established and served as a board member for several  foundations, including Latchkey Foundation. 
In 2010, Mr. Scripps, as lead funder and co-founder, worked with Sinclair Sherrill to  organize the preliminary philanthropic project which led to establishing Boon  in 2015. Their original targeted research on education, strategic analysis, and  a growing basis of knowledge made it possible to direct new, major grants to  key education programs. It began in the studying of the learning differences  field and expanded to include the general education field, early and elementary  school education, legislation and public funding for education, literacy, and  professional development.
He  is a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology and founder of Sebastian  Scripps Industrial Design.
