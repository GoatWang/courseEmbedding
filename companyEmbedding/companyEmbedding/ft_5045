Armed with some know how, a few small touches and Walmart's Every Day Low Prices on home furnishings and decor, you can breathe new life into your living space   whether it be with fresh furniture like a bedroom set or something functional like a new bookshelf. Spaced out: Your living room life Are you rethinking your current living room? A new television is always a nice addition, but you may want a new sofa, arm chair or accent table first. When considering what furniture to buy, think about the space you have available and the look you want for the room. Possibly the most important piece of furniture in your living room will be the sofa. If you have a lot of space to work with, look for a big sofa that can accommodate your family and guests. If you don't have much space, look for something more compact, possibly even a loveseat. For additional seating (again, depending on how much space you have), you can add a loveseat, recliner or armless chair. An accent table and an ottoman can add functionality and style too. If you don't have a lot of interior design experience and you want a consistent look throughout the room, consider getting a living room furniture set. Living room sets come with different pieces to fit different spaces, so you can choose one that best serves your needs. You can also refresh the look of the room with smaller changes. Try reframing your pictures, adding some wall art or getting a new slipcover for the couch if you don't want to buy a new sofa. Decorative accent pillows are a great, inexpensive way to give your living room some personality as well. Stackable modular storage cubes are a simple design solution and they're eco-friendly. Cubes are an excellent home organizer for your modern living space. Each one is separate so you can stack them side by side or on top of each other, or you can get creative and build a pyramid or ladder design. You can also mix and match the colors or just keep it simple with a single shade. Build a better bedroom Getting a new set of bedding is a great way to give your bedroom a quick makeover, while providing the warmth and comfort you need. When picking out bedding, consider the size of your mattress, the climate and weather where you live, the material you want and whether you'd prefer a bedding set or separates. Bedding comes in the same sizes as mattresses (single, double, twin, full, queen, king and so on) so it's easy to match your sheets and blankets to your mattress size. For colder weather, choose bedding that is thicker, like a down duvet or comforter, and consider flannel-weave sheets if you tend to get cold more easily. For warmer weather, look for lighter top bedding and percale-weave or silk sheets. Cotton is the most popular material for sheets, but there are many varieties to pick from, including Pima and Egyptian cottons, both of which are extremely comfortable and luxurious. You can also choose from a variety of weaves, including percale, which is very soft, smooth and shiny. Easy kitchen solutions Your kitchen and dining area make up the heart of your home. Let's face it, with three meals per day, you spend a lot of time there eating, not to mention the time it takes to prepare the meals. With kitchenware, dinnerware, kitchen furniture and more from Walmart, you can make these areas functional, welcoming spaces for the entire family. The kitchen can easily be made more inviting by adding a fresh coat of paint to the cabinets and walls. For finishing touches, get some color-coordinated kitchen towels or potholders, and place a new plant in the kitchen window. Keep your kitchen neat and organized with storage and organization products, including pantries, racks, cabinet and counter organizers and food storage containers. Handy products like these make it easier to find what you need when you need it, so you can prepare meals with less confusion and frustration. Complete sets of pots, pans and knives make cooking easier, whether you're prepping for your family or a crowd. And if you like to bake, it's worth stocking up on bakeware, so you always have what you need. Let there be lighting New window treatments and lighting can really pick up the atmosphere throughout your home. Choose window furnishings that add both color and style and let in the natural light from your outdoor surroundings. Then use accent lights to highlight your favorite keepsakes and add light fixtures that complement your decor.

There's more to choosing a new rug than just picking a pattern you like, however. At Walmart, you'll find a wide variety of area rugs, accent rugs and runners at Every Day Low Prices. We offer rugs in all ranges of colors, styles and sizes to coordinate with your furniture and home's decor in every room in the house. Consider the following points before you begin shopping. Kids' & Teens' Rugs From novelty football shapes to black tinsel fur and rainbow zebra to peace sign patterns on accent rugs, kids and teens have options to decorate their rooms right down to the floor. Kids can find rugs to match their passions, from rugs printed with world maps to solar systems to graphic prints and images of Manhattan and Paris. You'll find loads of bold and colorful or soothing and tranquil ideas to go from playroom to dorm room. Look for coordinating accessories like toss pillows, curtains and bedding Consider machine-washable rugs or spot-cleanable cotton rugs for younger kids Try rugs with non-skid backings to keep little feet stable, especially in rooms with hardwood flooring Indoor/outdoor rugs & Doormats An indoor/outdoor rug looks as good under your dining room table as it does under your patio table. These double-duty rugs are manufactured for ultra-durability and easy maintenance, and they're resistant to mold, mildew, sun, water and other elements. When it comes to indoor/outdoor doormats, choose from durable options including rubber or crack- and warp-resistant bamboo. Indoor/outdoor rugs are made from synthetics or synthetic blends Indoor/outdoor rugs and doormats are easy to wash off with a garden hose Make sure your interior doormat is thin enough to allow your door to easily open Specialty Rugs Turn to unique ideas that express your style when it comes to accent rugs. Available in a variety of materials, these rugs feature prints and bright colors that help you achieve the decor look you love. Rug sets are ideal for pulling together a room's decor and allowing you to define zones in large areas with rugs that are identically styled Kitchen anti-fatigue mats offer additional comfort with gel-infused padding Activity rugs for young kids let them use their imaginations with themes, including horse farms, car racing tracks, hopscotch squares and city streets Monogrammed rugs make ideal wedding, anniversary, baby shower, hostess or housewarming gifts for bedrooms, bathrooms or even in front of a fireplace for a classic touch Rug Grips & Rug Pads Rug grips are used under rugs with rough woven but slippery backings. If you have wood floors, it's a smart idea to get a rug grip to hold the rug and its edges in place and prevent tripping on wrinkled sections or curled edges. Rugs without non-slip backings can work if you place them on textured tile or carpet, but as a precaution, a rug pad or rug grip is a smart purchase. Rug pads come in various materials and thicknesses, and some work best on wood or carpet. A rug pad also prevents your rug from slipping and bunching, but it also has added padding to protects the rug from the wear and tear of heavy traffic. Look for special round rug pads for your shaped rugs Be sure to move rug grips by lifting them up every so often so they don't damage the floor beneath Size and Proportion Tips Balance the look for your room by placing your rug in the appropriate position under furniture. By balancing the room with a rug, you'll impact the space's look, feel and functionality. Rugs come in various sizes that allow design flexibility, including 2'x3', 3'x5', 5'x8', 6'x9' and 8'x10'. Living room: make sure the rug is large enough to fit under the front legs of your sofa and chairs Living room: leave 12 18 inches of exposed flooring around the edges of the rug Dining room: the rug under the table should extend 1' beyond chairs when they're pulled out Bedroom: choose a large plush rug to create warm greeting for bare feet Hallways: long, narrow runner rugs for hallways should leave several inches of exposed floor on either side of for a balanced look Types of Weaves The weave of a rug determines how flat or fluffy it will look and feel. For the look of luxury, choose handmade or hand-knotted rugs, or achieve a similar look with a hand-tufted rug. Tufted rugs have a soft, plush feel. They're often machine-washable and backed with skid-resistant material Hand-woven and hand-knotted rugs are more expensive, more durable and may require professional cleaning Flat weave rugs have a flat, thin pile but can be layered for extra padding Braided rugs are chunky and highly durable with classic looks Types of Fibers Despite their variety, it's easy to understand rug fibers. Most fibers used to manufacture rugs are highly durable to withstand high-traffic areas, but some fibers are more expensive and can only be spot-cleaned. Wool is soft underfoot, durable and ideal for high-traffic areas. It's sometime safe to use infrequently in damp areas, and it insulates a room efficiently. It's typically more expensive than most other fibers. Cotton is affordable and soft on the feet, but its piles need to be re-fluffed regularly. Cotton requires spot cleaning to prevent shrinkage and is smooth enough to require a rug pad. Natural fibers include jute, sea grass and sisal. They're cool underfoot and often have cotton borders for extra durability. They need to be spot cleaned and may require rug pads to prevent slippage unless placed on top of another rug or carpet for stability. Synthetics such as olefin, nylon, polypropylene, acrylic and other man-made fibers are fade and stain resistant, machine-washable and typically have latex backings.Show moreElectrode, Comp-117692765, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-Magellan Roadmate 5045 Overview - CNET

Add your unique touch to your space with home decor itemsthere's a reason that being an interior decorator can be such a lucrative career. The ability to create unique spaces within people's homes that they love and that wows visitors is a gift. If you don t want to go the professional decorator route, you can still create a space that shows off your personal tastes and represents who you're as a person and that of your family. Walmart makes it easy to find just the right home decor items to make your home the showplace you want it to be, and we can help you do so while saving you money at the same time with our Every Day Low Prices.curtains and window treatmentsThe right curtains or window treatments really set off a room, such as a living room or bedroom. In addition to looking good, curtains and window treatments need to be functional as well, which is what may cause someone to favor one over the other. Curtains and drapes are a way to add color, style and depth to a room and can serve to showcase the windows of your home. They're available in many colors as well as materials, including linen, cotton, rayon, satin, polyester, silk and several different fabric blends. You can choose curtains and drapes that run from the ceiling to the floor to create the illusion of higher ceilings, or those that are just slightly larger than the window they're covering for a crisper look or if you have small children or pets at home that you don't want to play with longer curtains. When selecting curtains and drapes you need to know both the length and the width you need for the space, as well as if you want them to have tiebacks or have certain properties like odor neutralizing and energy efficiency.Another common window treatment is the use of blinds and shades. Blinds are especially functional because they make it easy to control how much light comes in through the windows, and you can adjust them depending on the time of day. Many shades are made from wood, wood composite or synthetic wood, but there are shades made from vinyl, metal and bamboo as well. Depending on the blinds, they generally rest inside the window frame, so you'll need to know the length and width of your window frame before selecting them as well as deciding whether you want vertical or horizontal blinds. Shades often work in conjunction with drapes or curtains and are ideal for keep sunlight out, especially on hot days. These also go inside the window frame. Choose cordless shades that pull down and raise with a quick tug when you don't want dangling cords.Lighting and light fixturesLighting options include permanent fixtures such as overhead lighting, wall fixtures and ceiling fan lights. Lamps are portable lights you can place anywhere and can range from table lamps to floor lamps. Permanent ceiling fixtures that you choose depend on the style you're seeking to match. For an Old World or traditional feel, you can select chandeliers or pendant lighting. For more modern touches, dome or flush mount lighting and track lighting are good options. Chandeliers look especially good above a dining table or in an entryway or hall. Many permanent fixtures allow you to control the amount of light put out through the use of a dimmer switch you can add. Ceiling fans with lights serve a dual purpose and allow you to run one without the other or both at the same time. Ceiling fans also help the heating and cooling units in your home be more efficient, giving you added cost savings on your energy bills.Lamps are often more decorative pieces and can fall under many distinctive style schemes. Many table lamps are modern-looking pieces with lots of metal, such as brushed nickel or stainless steel. More traditional-looking table lamps are available with ceramic and wooden bases. Most table lamps have lampshades, which can add a splash of color to the room. Floor lamps can blend into the background of a room or be a showpiece that draws attention. Place one in a corner for a warm lighting effect. You can mix or match lamps for a room, and some are even available in sets.RugsIf you have hardwood or vinyl flooring, a throw rug or area rug is a functional and stylish addition to any room. Many area rugs offer unique color schemes or designs that can set off a room. You can use these rugs to cover up bare areas of your floor, including high-traffic areas, or place them under furniture, such as dining tables and coffee tables, adding some stability and protecting your floors at the same time. You can also add accent rugs and runners to areas of your floor that you'd rather see covered or places where rugs would be more comfortable on your feet and that of your family and friends.Other decor itemsArtwork and wall decor can make plain wall spaces in your home come alive with color. You can choose from canvas wall art, wall decals or framed wall art, such as paintings and sketches. You can also add family portraits or framed pictures to make your wall spaces more personal. Mirrors, both wall hanging and floor standing, can add depth to a room and make it seem larger.If your sofa, loveseat or armchairs are lacking in vitality, a few colorful throw and decor pillows can liven them up. These pillows are also functional, making an evening of TV watching more comfortable. Pillows come in many sizes, although most are square, round or rectangle, and feature a variety of color and designs, such as stripes, floral, animal and graphic prints. Choose what you love best and what brings out the decor in your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863236, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Modeling sediment accumulation in North American playa wetlands in response to climate change, 1940–2100Product Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2013Author(s): Burris, L.E. and S.K. SkagenSuggested Citation: Burris, L.E. and S.K. Skagen. 2013. Modeling sediment accumulation in North American playa wetlands in response to climate change, 1940–2100. Climatic Change. 117(1-2): 69-83. Playa wetlands on the west-central Great Plains of North America are vulnerable to sediment infilling from upland agriculture, putting at risk several important ecosystem services as well as essential habitats and food resources of diverse wetland-dependent biota. Climate predictions for this semi-arid area indicate reduced precipitation which may alter rates of erosion, runoff, and sedimentation of playas. We forecasted erosion rates, sediment depths, and resultant playa wetland depths across the west-central Great Plains and examined the relative roles of land use context and projected changes in precipitation in the sedimentation process. We estimated erosion with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) using historic values and downscaled precipitation predictions from three general circulation models and three emissions scenarios. We calibrated RUSLE results using field sediment measurements. RUSLE is appealing for regional scale modeling because it uses climate forecasts with monthly resolution and other widely available values including soil texture, slope and land use. Sediment accumulation rates will continue near historic levels through 2070 and will be sufficient to cause most playas (if not already filled) to fill with sediment within the next 100 years in the absence of mitigation. Land use surrounding the playa, whether grassland or tilled cropland, is more influential in sediment accumulation than climate-driven precipitation change.
