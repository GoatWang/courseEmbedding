How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Rogers William H Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Rogers William H Jr



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

                                            William H. "Bill" Rogers, 61, formerly of Hamilton, passed away Tuesday, January 17, 2017 in Indianapolis. He was preceded in death by his parents, Herbert Lee Rogers and Elsie Riddle; grandmother, Rose Flowers as well as sisters, Debbie and Heather. Bill is survived by his wife of 32 years, Deborah Rogers; son, William H. Rogers, Jr. (B. J.) and his fiancé, Renee Lockhart; grandchildren, Tyler and Shelby Rogers; sisters, Rebecca Goble, Grace Rogers and Rose Hibbard as well as a host of nieces, nephews, other extended family and friends. He had an undying love for the Cincinnati Bengals and was proud of his years of service to the U.S. Navy. Bill overcame many obstacles in his life but ended up prevailing over all of them. He will be truly missed but heaven gained another soldier. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 10am on Tuesday, January 24 at St. Julie Billiart Church, 224 Dayton St, Hamilton. Visitation will follow mass at the Ivey Funeral Home, 2565 Princeton Rd, Hamilton, concluding with entombment at Rose Hill Burial Park, Hamilton.
