A global investment and technology development firm
The D. E. Shaw group is a global investment and technology development firm with more than $42
    billion in investment capital as of April 1, 2017, and offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. Since our
    founding in 1988, our firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation,
    careful risk management, and the quality and depth of our staff. We have a significant presence in the world's
    capital markets, investing in a wide range of companies and financial instruments in both developed and developing
    economies.
Our culture rewards analytical rigor and adherence to the highest possible ethical and legal standards,
    and we've cultivated a collegial work environment that promotes collaboration across disciplines, geographies, and
    investment strategies. Our firm has been built in part by attempting to do what other companies might consider
    impossible, or never imagine at all. A single transformative idea that ultimately works—for a new business, a
    new trading model, or an improved back office process—is worth a dozen ideas that lead nowhere. We've learned
    that when an extraordinary team sets extraordinarily ambitious goals, astonishing breakthroughs can be expected.

Our firm has made a conscious effort to build a carefully selected team of uniquely talented
    individuals, each among the very best in his or her profession. Our colleagues come from varying disciplines but

Besides being keenly engaged in our work, we have diverse interests and backgrounds, many of which are far removed

        and Physics Olympiad medalists.
    
Over 60 of our investment professionals hold Ph.D.'s.
Approximately 20 percent of our staff are published authors, whose work ranges from papers in specialized
        academic journals to award-winning mystery novels.
    
Our staff members pursue wide-ranging personal interests as entrepreneurs, patent holders, competitive sailors
        and marathoners, professional opera singers, board members of nonprofit organizations, and champion bridge
        players.

A STIMULATING AND COLLEGIAL ENVIRONMENT 

The D. E. Shaw group offers opportunities for individuals of all backgrounds who display
    evidence of outstanding ability and have a track record of exceptional accomplishment. As a globally prominent
    alternative investment manager, our firm offers world-class technology infrastructure and research capabilities, but
    we are still small and nimble enough to remain deeply entrepreneurial, always looking for new hires who bring fresh
    perspectives.
Our firm prizes intellectual curiosity and integrity, creative idea generation, and the relentless pursuit of
    results. We recognize that different things help people thrive: some are more productive working in t-shirts or
    listening to music, while others need time away from the office to recharge after a challenging project. We offer
    great benefits and perks, from game rooms, plentiful snacks, and a gym to back-up childcare and creative social
    events. Our primary focus is to sustain a stimulating, supportive, and fun work environment where our employees can
    do their best work.


    Because we prioritize continual learning, we offer mentoring programs and onsite courses, as well as online
    resources to aid in professional development. We bring in external speakers from academia and industry on a range of
    topics, from highly technical to broadly educational. We aim to give all of our staff the opportunity to enjoy
    challenging work, friendly colleagues, and benefits that focus on personal growth and wellness.

GLOBAL INVESTING ACROSS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES AND DISCIPLINES
The D. E. Shaw group pursues attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns on the capital
    we invest for our clients. The firm invests globally using a broad array of strategies in both public and private
    markets. Widely recognized as a pioneer in quantitative investing, particularly in equities, futures, and options,
    the firm also has formidable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion,
    such as credit, energy, and macro investing. Regardless of the particular strategy, each investment decision is made
    in the context of a rigorous analytical approach that seeks to carefully identify and weigh potential risks and
    rewards.
The firm's investment activities fall into two broad areas:
Alternative Investments
Strategies focused on the delivery of absolute returns, with low targeted correlation to traditional assets like
    equities, account for around $26 billion of the firm's investment capital. Our alternative investment
    program dates to 1989 and consists of both larger, core multi-strategy investment vehicles and more focused,
    strategy-specific investment products.
Benchmark-Relative and Global Asset Class Investments
Long-biased strategies focusing on major, liquid asset classes represent approximately $15 billion of the
    firm's investment capital. Launched in 2000, a suite of long-only and "130/30" benchmark-relative equity investment
    strategies deploy a systematic investment process that enables institutional investors to customize their exposure
    to a particular index. A discretionary strategy launched in 2013 seeks dynamic exposures to multiple global asset
    classes, enhanced by select alpha opportunities.

A global investment and technology development firm
The D. E. Shaw group is a global investment and technology development firm with more than $42
    billion in investment capital as of April 1, 2017, and offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. Since our
    founding in 1988, our firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation,
    careful risk management, and the quality and depth of our staff. We have a significant presence in the world's
    capital markets, investing in a wide range of companies and financial instruments in both developed and developing
    economies.
Our culture rewards analytical rigor and adherence to the highest possible ethical and legal standards,
    and we've cultivated a collegial work environment that promotes collaboration across disciplines, geographies, and
    investment strategies. Our firm has been built in part by attempting to do what other companies might consider
    impossible, or never imagine at all. A single transformative idea that ultimately works—for a new business, a
    new trading model, or an improved back office process—is worth a dozen ideas that lead nowhere. We've learned
    that when an extraordinary team sets extraordinarily ambitious goals, astonishing breakthroughs can be expected.

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]
Offices[edit]

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

Dividend yieldThe annual rate of return on a share of stock, determined by dividing the annual dividend by its current share price. In a stock mutual fund, this figure represents the average dividend yield of the stocks held by the fund.

Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

Product management
Vanguard Growth and Income Fund seeks a total return greater than that of the S&P 500 Index by investing in U.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks. The funds three investment advisors manage independent subportfolios. Although each advisor uses a different process to select securities, each is committed to using computer models to select a broadly diversified group of stocks that, as a whole, have investment characteristics similar to the S&P 500 Index, but are expected to provide a higher total return than that of the index.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

History[edit]
The firm was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University faculty member, and has more than 1,300 employees.[3] David Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, David Shaw removed himself from day to day involvement in the firm, and transitioned leadership to a team of six managing directors: Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone and Eric Wepsic.[4] The firm's management structure of the same six-member executive committee remained intact through 2010.[3][5]
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D.E. Shaw & Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow.[6] After the Russian debt default in 1998, the company suffered losses in its fixed-income trading.[7]
In December 2003, a subsidiary of one of the company's funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz, which reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate, Laminar Portfolios, acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.[8] In August 2004, D. E. Shaw & Co., along with MIC Capital, proposed to inject $50M into the bankrupt WCI Steel. In December 2004, D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 6.6% of USG Corp, a wallboard manufacturer seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of rising asbestos liabilities.[9]
In 2006, Lawrence Summers became managing director at D.E. Shaw & Co. and left in 2008, receiving $5.2 million in compensation for that period.[10] In late 2009 during the Financial Crisis it was reported that D.E. Shaw & Co. had set up a Portfolio Acquisitions Unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds.[11]
D.E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006,[12] with Anil Chawla, then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India & South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations are headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. Under Anil Chawla as the CEO for India, D.E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included the setting up of a joint-venture company with India's largest private sector company Reliance Industries [13] to provide financial services; real estate company DLF Assets Limited; publishing group Amar Ujala Publications; animation company, Crest Communications and renewable energy company, Soham Energy. After stepping down as CEO of D.E.Shaw in 2012, Anil Chawla continued as an advisor to the company until 2014.
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20% minority stake to Lehman Brothers, as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings.[14] At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. had holdings in D.E. Shaw & Co.[15]
Investment strategy[edit]
The company manages a variety of investment funds[16] that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research in the management of its investments.[3][17][18] The Company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, and financial services firms and in distressed company financing.[4] In addition to its financial businesses, D. E. Shaw & Co. has provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures, including Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.[19] The company has $40 billion in aggregate capital[20][21] and in 2011 had $15.6 billion in hedge fund assets under management and was ranked as the 21st largest hedge fund by Institutional Investor.[20][22][23]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as Math-M-Addicts (teachers are D. E. Shaw & Co. employees),[24] American Regions Mathematics League,[25] Worldwide Online Olympiad Training (WOOT), United States of America Mathematics Olympiad and the International Mathematics Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, the MIT 6.370 Battlecode Competition,[26] and The Center for Excellence in Education.[27]

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
