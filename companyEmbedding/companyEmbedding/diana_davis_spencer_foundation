Here are the Conservative Ed Creds of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation — Inside Philanthropy





























































































K-12 Education

Here are the Conservative Ed Creds of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation

September 20, 2013/


Brenden Timpe



For the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, there is no priority more important than the development of the next generation.
While the foundation uses its generous endowment to support a wide variety of interests, education and children are clearly near the top of the priority list. And the latest grants make clear that the foundation is not afraid to straddle the line between education and politics.
The foundation itself may be new, but the family that runs it has plenty of experience in the philanthropic world. Its roots are in the wealth of Shelby Cullom Davis, a writer, businessman, politician, and philanthropist. His wealth was passed down to the Kathryn W. Davis Foundation, which is now the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation that still carries plenty of weight in conservative circles today.
Given this long history, it’s no surprise that many of the foundation’s grantees are long-term beneficiaries. Groups like the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies receive consistent support.
However, 2012's crop of grantees include a number of new faces, many of them geared toward education and education policy. Grants under the educational banner have grown steadily over the last three years, totaling $763,000 in 2012 alone.
Many of these grants are apolitical. For example, the foundation for the first time supported Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit that provides teacher training, behavioral interventions, and other services for low-performing public schools in areas with high poverty. The goal is to give students at these schools a better environment to learn — and thus a better opportunity to succeed.
On the political side, the foundation launched its first-ever support for the Goldwater Institute, where a $5,000 donation is supporting the “Education Savings Accounts: Challenges and Choices for Every Child” initiative. Education Savings Accounts are much like school vouchers, except that they give parents even wider latitude to spend their student’s funds. The money can be used for private school tuition, as school vouchers are, or purchases like tutoring services and books. The program has been implemented in Arizona, and the Goldwater Institute joined the state attorney general in defending its constitutionality in a court case.
Like the Like the Turnaround for Children project, the foundation believes the Education Savings Accounts effort will help underprivileged students – in Arizona, it is aimed at children with special needs and children in underperforming schools.
This is a common thread in much of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation’s grant-making. Those who break into the foundation’s selective group of grantees are often providing services to underprivileged children or advocating for conservative public policy that they believe will help them.

Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Awards Grant



March 9, 2016



The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation recently made a $100,000 grant to the National Museum of the United States Army, joining other foundations such as the Alaska-based Rasmuson Foundation in supporting the Capital Campaign.
Diana Davis Spencer, an education advocate and former journalist, has followed in her parents’ footsteps by continuing the foundation’s tradition of innovative grant making. The foundation promotes entrepreneurship and free enterprise by supporting the healthcare, art, environment, and education sectors. Additionally, the foundation provides grants in the fields of public policy, global initiatives, and national security.
Founded by Shelby Cullum Davis and named after his daughter Diana Davis Spencer, the foundation is located in Bethesda, MD. Davis’ wife Kathryn served as the Chairman of the Board until her passing in 2013 at age 106. Diana Davis Spencer currently serves as President, and her daughter, Abby S. Moffat, is its Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in their continuation of Shelby’s philanthropic legacy.
“We greatly appreciate the generosity of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation,” said Army Historical Foundation’s Executive Director, BG Creighton W. Abrams, Jr. (USA-Ret.) “The support of this local foundation speaks to the importance this Museum will have regionally as well as nationally, and we are especially pleased that the leadership of the foundation has made this commitment in recognition of the vital role the U.S. Army has played in areas ranging from education to national security.”

Founding Values - The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation





















































 

















 






















 























Give me liberty or give me death. –Patrick Henry

 


Founding Values

 



The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it. Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure.
 
— Albert Einstein

 



Our Founding Fathers enshrined freedom, limited government, and individual responsibility in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They knew that these values would guide future generations to prosperity and happiness.
 
Today, the growth of big government endangers these principles. Society increasingly depends on fiscally unsustainable entitlement and welfare programs.
 
To guarantee their political, social, and economic freedoms, Americans must rediscover and apply their founding values. We’re helping them do so through our support to a variety of research, advocacy, and educational organizations.
 
For example, the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy supports over 50,000 legal professionals committed to preserving constitutional government and the rule of law. One Generation Away develops educational projects to teach Americans of all ages about the Constitution and how it applies to modern issues. Liberty’s Promise instills our founding values in new immigrants and helps integrate them into American civic society.
 
Our founding values have provided over two centuries of economic, political, and moral guidance to citizens of the greatest nation in human history. By understanding and upholding these values, Americans can ensure a free, vibrant society for years to come.

 






































































Public Policy - The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation





















































 

















 






















 























Lincoln-Douglas Debates

 


Public Policy

 



A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.
 — Dwight Eisenhower

 



Sound public policy encourages entrepreneurship and protects individual liberty. With these principles under attack, smart policies are needed now more than ever.
 
A constantly expanding federal government threatens the freedoms of both states and citizens. Excessive regulations prevent entrepreneurs from creating and growing the small businesses that drive the economy.
 
The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation is committed to downsizing government and opening markets, so all Americans can reach their potential. That’s why we support institutes and think tanks that are researching, developing, and advocating less intrusive laws and regulations.
 
For example, the Institute for Justice intertwines public policy, education, and free enterprise. They’ve been very successful cutting through government regulations, and recently helped defend a group of monks whose handmade casket business was being strangled by unfair regulations.
 
Likewise, the National Right to Work has empowered employees to fight back against discriminatory laws that force them to join unions against their will. The Heritage Foundation has promoted free enterprise, limited government solutions for decades.
 
We’re empowering leaders who are committed to implementing policies that embody our founding principles.

Mission

 


The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation espouses the values upon which our nation was founded: freedom and individual responsibility. The mission of the foundation is to promote national security, entrepreneurship, self-reliance, free enterprise, and to enhance quality of life by supporting the arts, education, global understanding, health advancements, and preservation of the environment.

 



Letter from
the President

 


Dear Friends,
 
Here at the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, we believe individuals are our most precious resource. Only by investing in them can we ensure a strong national defense, a free society, and a vibrant economy where innovation and entrepreneurship thrive.
 
As one of the few philanthropic organizations focused on bolstering U.S. national security, we’ve committed extensive resources to support our military and intelligence communities.
 
Yet we recognize a strong national defense depends on more than just having the best training and information. Only an educated populace, instilled with America’s founding values and unshackled from overbearing government institutions, can secure the full blessings of liberty.
 
This is why we’re collaborating with a host of like-minded groups to make those goals a reality. With every grant, the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation seeks to provide people with tools to take charge of their own lives. From early education programs that enable students to accelerate their development, to public policy institutes that help defend economic and political freedoms, our foundation is committed to empowering individuals to reach their full potential.
 
As we tackle current issues and take on new challenges, we’re excited to continue making our nation and the world safer and more prosperous.
 
Sincerely,

Diana Davis Spencer
Chairman and President

 







































































Entrepreneurship - The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation





















































 

















 






















 























Wright Brothers’ First Flight

 


Entrepreneurship

 



Genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration.
— Thomas Edison

 



Small businesses drive economic growth. They employ half of all U.S. workers, create two of every three new jobs, and patent new inventions 16 times faster than large firms.
 
But the future of small business is under threat. Americans are starting new businesses at the lowest rate in decades, even as the small business failure rate increases due to suffocating regulations.
 
To reverse this worrying trend, we’re working to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in today’s youth.
 
Reviving American small business starts with teaching the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. That’s why we’re working to expose students to entrepreneurship through education. The Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship encourages middle and high school students to establish their own businesses. The students have the opportunity to present their business plans in competitions — and winners go on to compete in the national competition in New York City.
 
We’re also proud to contribute to programs that promote social entrepreneurship such as College of Atlantic, Global Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and Bethesda Green.
 
Another empowering organization, Rising Tide Capital, teaches and assists low-income entrepreneurs to build stronger businesses.
 
Teaching entrepreneurship isn’t merely a way to spur economic growth and job creation. By inspiring people to turn their creative ideas and passions into business ventures, we’re helping individuals unlock their full potential and live the American dream.

History of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation

 










The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation continues a multi-generational history of family philanthropy. It evolved from the Shelby Cullom Davis Foundation, established in 1962, and the Kathryn W. Davis Foundation, established in 2004.
 
Both Shelby and Kathryn earned their doctorates in International Relations from the University of Geneva.
 
Shelby, an author and successful investment banker, was the longest serving American ambassador to Switzerland. His wife, Kathryn Wasserman Davis, was an author, community leader, and renowned lecturer in Russian affairs. She took up art at age 95 and exhibited at juried shows.
 
Today, their daughter, Diana Davis Spencer, serves as president and chairman of the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation. A journalist and activist, Diana leads the foundation and directs its grant-making efforts.
 
Abby Spencer Moffat, Diana’s daughter, serves as the foundation’s chief executive officer. A former business leader and entrepreneur, she serves on several boards and oversees the foundation’s day-to-day operations.

The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Grands Teach For America – D.C. Region $3 Million to Enhance Local Education Efforts











      Body    



WASHINGTON, D.C., May 25, 2016—The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation granted Teach For America–D.C. Region $3 million, to be distributed over three years, to expand recruitment and ongoing professional support of current corps members and alumni working in the area’s low-income schools.
This comes as the region prioritizes building on its history of providing culturally responsive corps members and alumni teachers by developing their leadership and enduring commitment as education advocates locally and nationally. With grants like these, the region is able to provide teachers with the necessary tools and skills to create affirming and culturally relevant pedagogy for their students. By engaging in this professional development, current corps members Tihitina Chamiso (D.C. Region Corps ’15) and Deseree King (D.C. Region Corps ’15) were able to lead their first grade students to complete “Where I'm From" projects which focused on strengthening their students’ senses of self and cultural pride.
“I am grateful to the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation and excited that their contribution will allow our current teachers and alumni to continue working with local teachers, principals, and partnering districts to keep making a positive difference for students and families,” said Teach For America–D.C. Region executive director Adele Fabrikant. “It is through commitment like this that we can recruit, train, and empower talented and diverse leaders to expand educational opportunity for students in our community.”
Since 1992, Teach For America–D.C.  Region has collaborated with local public and charter schools to attract, retain, and support 3,500 effective educators who have impacted 224,000 students across the region. These educators have worked in collaboration with school leaders and students across the district as part of the effort to ensure D.C. Public Schools’ National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores continue to improve. Last year’s high scores led to D.C. becoming the fastest improving urban school district in the nation. Of 2,600 TFA alumni currently working in the region, 55 percent remain in education. Ryan Tauriainen (Hawaii Corps’08), for example, was named The Washington Post’s 2016 Principal of the Year for his impact at AppleTree Institute Early Learning Public Charter School. Alumni no longer in the classroom, impact the region in other ways – through graduate school, law, policy, advocacy and business.
“Teach For America corps members and alumni bring their passion, enthusiasm, and innovation to the classroom and with their heart and soul, they help students realize the importance of staying in school,” said Diana Davis Spencer, President of the foundation. “The Diana Davis Spencer Foundation is enthusiastic to support these dedicated corps members and alumni.”
In March, the region honored Spencer at its sixth annual gala, highlighting how grants from her foundation and those like it allow Teach For America–D.C. Region to develop a new strategic approach and innovative methods for corps member retention and alumni engagement, all contributing to expanding opportunities for students across the D.C. area.
