Customer Questions & Answers








            Would this be good to sand a popcorn ceiling
        


Asked by: don

            NO! Popcorn ceiling texture can contain ASBESTOS; which is known to be extremely hazardous to one's health. If you sand the texture, the fine particles can cause latent, and severe heath problems to anyone exposed.  
They must be scraped. 
If you absolutely insist on removing it yourself, 
when removing a popcorn ceiling texture, it's advisable to wear eye protection, and a (pink cartridge) mask, cover the floors with plastic, spray-dampen the texture, and gently scrape the texture off. Keep the texture damp. When it falls to the floor, you can collect it in the floor-covering plastic, seal it in a bag, and call your local disposal company to make arrangements for its safe disposal. As long as the texture particles remain encapsulated, and damp, you should be fine. Please be safe. Good luck and best wishes.

            Can you connect a shop vac/ ridgid brand vacuum to collect the dust?
        


Asked by: Lauren

            Yes it will, but do yourself a favor and buy the vacuum bags for the Rigid shop vac to hold the dust. This will save you lots of time and mess clearing the filter.

            Where can I find sanding discs?
        

            The description says the sander has an 8.5&quot; head, which seems to have very limited options for sanding discs. Is there a recommended product number for replacement sanding discs? Also, since there's integrated dust collection, do the discs need to have a specific hole pattern, or are they solid without perforations?

            Will the WEN sander work to remove textured ceilings and sand down smooth?  (also known as stomped texture or stippled ceiling texture).
        
Asked by: JeepGirl

            Generally it would take a multi-step process for a uniform finish.

1. Lightly scrape the surface to remove the points.
2. Sand down the peaks bringing them closer to the valleys, but make sure not to oversand or 'burn' the drywall paper/tape.

3. Texture removal usually leaves an uneven surface but it can be built back up by a) applying a skim coat of drywall mud for a smooth surface and a final sand or b) applying a new texture.

After that an appropriate drywall primer should be used on all new surfaces (drywall mud or texture) to even out the porosity of the surface and make it stronger before applying paint for the top coat.

I own a home remodeling company. A large amount of our work is renovations. Drywall is a large part of the scope of work that we perform. I have used the Porter-Cable sander in the past multiple times, usually borrowed from a drywall friend of mine. I bought this unit not expecting too much based on the selling price. I just finished hanging and taping a 70 sheet job, and am very pleased with the WEN sander. Works very well once you get the right RPM. I hooked it up to a Fein Turbo I. Very impressed. I'll see if it can withstand regular use, but it does come with a two year warranty. I could buy three of these for the price of the Porter-Cable. It's about the same weight as the PC and the same loudness. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to save time and money. In addition, I used Norton hook and loop 180 grit with no holes and had minimal dust. I cut an X in the middle of the sanding disc with a knife and had no problems. For the handyman/homeowner, I wouldn't recommend using lightweight or midweight joint compound on your first try with the sander. I used Gold Bond Pro Form. It's much better than USG products and easier to work with. Good luck and I'll keep you all posted on how durable it is.

        Good sander, not so good vacuum design
I bought this sander a month ago from Home Depot and have used it enough now to review it. The sander itself does a great job and makes drywall sanding go way faster. On this I give it 5 stars. But, the vacuum function is not very well designed. The sanding pads attach with velcro to a disc that spins. Both the disc and sanding pads have six small holes which line up. It is through these holes that the vacuum draws and they simply aren't large enough to draw well. Sanding dust accumulates inside these holes and along the outer edges of the disc which is surrounded by a brush. When stopping the sander and taking it away from the surface that accumulated dust can fall out and create a mess. 

I tried using a more powerful shop vac, went from 3 hp to 5 hp, to see if more draw would help. It doesn't. The draw is forever going to be limited by those six tiny holes which get clogged too easily. I understand now why Porter Cable's version of this drywall sander costs so much more. Their disc uses a single wide hole in the center which is much larger than the six small holes the Wen uses. I'm guessing that single larger hole offers much better draw and is unlikely to clog.

Overall the Wen sander will do a fine job and the price is a quarter of the Porter Cable drywall sander. I just wish the folks at Wen had given more thought to the vacuum function and the design of the disc and pads. This would be a five star product if it weren't for that.

        Way to heavy
I'm 26 and it took everything I had to hold it up to rough sand my 12x25 living room. I had a 5 hp shop vac hooked up to it and when I would bring it down to the floor it would blow dust everywhere. It serves its purpose but I still hand sanded to finish it completely. If you don't shut it off and take it off the wall you can rip the paper on the drywall. It is good for spots that you have to use extra compound to smooth out a bad spot.

The sander came boxed in excellent condition. When removed the assembly was minimal and basic. The sander is made to last in structure with strong looking material. Other reviews have mentioned that it is heavy. It is a little heavy but the trade off would be a flimsy unit and not of a durable material. Recommend going at the sanding slowly working on the speed a duration over the drywall to not over do it one area. Huge time saver for the big areas..... Beats doing all by hand any day..... Sandpaper selection is available online for this unit. Would be nice if Home Depot had in store selection as well.

WEN 6369 Variable Speed 5-Amp Drywall Sander with 15-Foot Hose

	Remember when you could sand those hard to reach places? The WEN Variable Speed Drywall Sander goes where no sander has gone before. With a pivoting 8.5-inch head that swivels in all directions, the WEN Drywall Sander automatically adjusts to be flush against every surface that crosses its path. Adjust the speed anywhere from 600 to 1500 RPM to meet the needs of the project at hand. The hook and loop base pad makes sandpaper changes a breeze while the foldable design allows for simple storage and transportation. The lightweight 9-pound body telescopes to reach lengths up to five feet away. This package also includes six pieces of hook and loop sandpaper disks (60, 80, 120, 150, 180 and 240 grit) along with a flexible dust vacuum hose that stretches up to 15 feet for reliable dust removal. And because it’s a WEN product, your Variable Speed Drywall Sander comes backed by a two-year warranty, a nationwide network of skilled service technicians and a friendly customer helpline. Remember when you could reach the unreachable? Remember WEN.

	 

Features:



			Variable speed adjustment operates anywhere from 600 to 1500 RPM

			Hook-and-loop base pad makes changing sandpaper easier than ever

			5-Amp head-mounted motor provides maximum torque to the sanding disk

			Automatic dust removal system combined with the 15-foot dust hose minimizes clean-up

			Includes 60, 80, 120, 150, 180 and 240 grit hook-and-loop 9-inch sanding discs

Development of the hydroecological integrity assessment process for determining environmental flows for New Jersey streamsProduct Type: Scientific Investigations ReportYear: 2007Author(s): Kennen, J.G., J.A.

Development of the hydroecological integrity assessment process for determining environmental flows for New Jersey streams. Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5206. U.S. Geological Survey. 56 p. The natural flow regime paradigm and parallel stream ecological concepts and theories have established the benefits of maintaining or restoring the full range of natural hydrologic variation for physiochemical processes, biodiversity, and the evolutionary potential of aquatic and riparian communities. A synthesis of recent advances in hydroecological research coupled with stream classification has resulted in a new process to determine environmental flows and assess hydrologic alteration. This process has national and international applicability. It allows classification of streams into hydrologic stream classes and identification of a set of non-redundant and ecologically relevant hydrologic indices for 10 critical sub-components of flow...
