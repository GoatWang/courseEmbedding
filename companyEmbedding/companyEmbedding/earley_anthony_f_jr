This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

PG&E names Anthony F. Earley Jr. as CEO

1 / 1


Back to Gallery
















PG&E Corp. on Monday named as its new CEO Anthony F. Earley Jr., a veteran power-industry executive credited with steering Detroit's electric utility through the largest blackout in American history.
Earley, 62, will replace Peter Darbee, who stepped down in April in an effort to help PG&E and its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., recover from a series of crises, including last year's fatal pipeline explosion in San Bruno. Earley's appointment marks the first time that PG&E has picked a new chief executive from outside the company's ranks.
For more than a decade, Earley served as chief executive officer of DTE Energy, parent company of Detroit Edison and Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. He gave up the CEO post last year but remained executive chairman of the company's board. His career also includes leadership stints with a utility trade group and a nuclear power association. 
"PG&E has a proud legacy," Earley said in a prepared statement. "It's a great privilege to help an iconic company recover from its recent challenges and reclaim its standing as the utility others admire and aspire to follow."

Trained as an engineer, Earley led DTE at the time of the August 2003 blackout that cut power to an estimated 55 million people in Canada and eight northeastern states. 
Michigan officials praised his response. Earley held seven press conferences in the first three days after the blackout, detailing the steps being taken to restore power and asking all customers who did have electricity to conserve power until the crisis was over.
"Tony Earley proved that he was a leader we could rely on to be open, honest and accountable at a very difficult time," said former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, in a statement released by PG&E. "He stepped up publicly. He made sure we knew what was happening, what we could expect and when we could expect it. And he made sure DTE came through and delivered on what it promised."
His crisis management skills will be tested in his new role. 
PG&E, which serves 15 million people in northern and central California, has struggled through a series of controversies over the past year. A PG&E-backed ballot initiative last year that would have limited the ability of local governments to enter the public power business failed at the polls and angered much of the state's political establishment. The company's $2.2 billion SmartMeter program prompted a customer backlash against the new wireless meters, which some people consider a health risk. 
And on Sept. 9, a PG&E natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and leveling a neighborhood. Subsequent government investigations revealed flawed welds on the line that ruptured and shoddy record-keeping on the company's vast network of pipes. PG&E has already spent $189 million responding to the blast, and costs could top $1 billion by year's end.
"PG&E customers want someone who can deliver safety and results," said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network consumer group. "It remains to be seen if he can deliver."
Earley received degrees in physics, engineering and law from the University of Notre Dame and has spent most of his life in the energy industry. That stands in contrast to Darbee, a former investment banker who held positions at Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, AT&T and Pacific Bell before joining PG&E.
Earley formerly served as chairman of both the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade association, and the Nuclear Energy Institute, the main lobbying group for the nuclear industry. He also served as an officer in the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine program.

PG&E names Anthony F. Earley Jr. as CEO

PG&E Corp. on Monday named as its new CEO Anthony F. Earley Jr., a veteran power-industry executive credited with steering Detroit's electric utility through the largest blackout in American history.
Earley, 62, will replace Peter Darbee, who stepped down in April in an effort to help PG&E and its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., recover from a series of crises, including last year's fatal pipeline explosion in San Bruno. Earley's appointment marks the first time that PG&E has picked a new chief executive from outside the company's ranks.
For more than a decade, Earley served as chief executive officer of DTE Energy, parent company of Detroit Edison and Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. He gave up the CEO post last year but remained executive chairman of the company's board. His career also includes leadership stints with a utility trade group and a nuclear power association. 
"PG&E has a proud legacy," Earley said in a prepared statement. "It's a great privilege to help an iconic company recover from its recent challenges and reclaim its standing as the utility others admire and aspire to follow."

Trained as an engineer, Earley led DTE at the time of the August 2003 blackout that cut power to an estimated 55 million people in Canada and eight northeastern states. 
Michigan officials praised his response. Earley held seven press conferences in the first three days after the blackout, detailing the steps being taken to restore power and asking all customers who did have electricity to conserve power until the crisis was over.
"Tony Earley proved that he was a leader we could rely on to be open, honest and accountable at a very difficult time," said former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, in a statement released by PG&E. "He stepped up publicly. He made sure we knew what was happening, what we could expect and when we could expect it. And he made sure DTE came through and delivered on what it promised."
His crisis management skills will be tested in his new role.
