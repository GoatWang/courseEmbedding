Ex-Div Reminder for PennTex Midstream Partners (PTXP)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 7/28/16, PennTex Midstream Partners LP will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.2846, payable on 8/12/16. As a percentage of PTXP's recent stock price of $16.61, this dividend works out to approximately 1.71%, so look for shares of PennTex Midstream Partners LP to trade 1.71% lower — all else being equal — when PTXP shares open for trading on 7/28/16.
