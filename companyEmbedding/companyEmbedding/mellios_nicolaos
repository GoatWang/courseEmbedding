Bennett v. Cake Gaming
New lawsuit names entities in Internet poker network
by Gaming Counsel, 
Apr 11, 2011 | 9:50 am  

  

Today I’m blogging about a Notice of Civil Claim against Cake Poker. You can see it here. The claim was filed last week with the Supreme Court of British Columbia in New Westminster (a suburb of Vancouver). I found out about this claim on www.calvinayre.com.
I’ll make full disclosure up front: I have acted for a party that, in the past, had interests adverse to Cake. I have not acted for anyone involved with, and I have nothing to do with, this lawsuit.
Who’s suing whom and why? Two individuals, Ryan Bennett and Francois Piette, and their partnership and a corporation controlled by them are seeking damages from a number of parties apparently associated with Cake. These parties include Cake Poker (Canada) Inc. and certain of its alleged affiliates (including Cake Gaming N.V. and Yummy Interactive (Canada) Inc.). Also named as individual defendants are Nicholaos Mellios, Christopher Ruck, and Ian Winter, who purportedly own a “substantial interest” in the Cake Gaming network and are collectively alleged to be “responsible for all major decisions regarding” the network. Finally, some other individuals said to be direct or indirect shareholders in the network were added as defendants.
The basic claim is that, in 2001, Bennett and Piette formulated “an advanced business [and] marketing model” unlike any other model then being used by an Internet poker site. This initiative by Bennett and Piette is called the “Legacy Project” in the statement of claim.

Corporate Update


June 22, 2017No Comments 

Vancouver, British Columbia–(Newsfile Corp. – June 15, 2017) – Mojo Games Inc., a subsidiary of Sterling Group Ventures, Inc (OTCQB: SGGV) is pleased to provide the following corporate update:
The company is nearing launch of a new turnkey casino solution for a B2B partner focused on high stake VIP players in the Eastern European market. The solution leverages Mojo’s advanced iGaming platform and table casino games integrated with tier 1 payment processing partners.
The company is pleased to provide an update on the India Skill Gaming Initiative – Our recently announced partner Baadshah Gaming has been fully deployed and is growing its base of players daily. Baadshah currently offers Mojo’s poker games and 3 rd party daily fantasy games integrated to Mojo’s iGaming platform.
The company is nearing a rollout of its own Direct to Consumer solution which will focus in emerging world markets, including India. The company is in discussion with marketing partners to assist in player acquisition.
The company regretfully reports that we will not be proceeding with VLeague’s opportunities in China. We will continue to seek partnerships in Asia that are mutually beneficial with strong upside.
The restructuring of Sterling and Mojo has taken more time than we expected and as such the financials have been delayed. We are continuing to proceed forward on our necessary filings and will notify shareholders when completed.
